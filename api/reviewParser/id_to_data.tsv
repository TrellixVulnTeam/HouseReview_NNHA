0	2515	"Stephanie was a wonderful host! Her apartment was beautiful and extremely clean. We had a very nice (and affordable!) stay in the city with private room and own bathroom.[QWERTY123]Such a wonderful place and very close to the metro station on the line 1 2 3. She was awesome with us, it was a pleasure to stay in her appt. she's french, so last word ...
Merci encore stephanie pour ton hospitalité. On a passé un super séjour avec toi. Très disponible pour nous avec pleins de conseils, je vous recommande particulierement cette adresse qui plus est pour un prix raisonnable. Le metro est juste a 1 bloc de l'appartement et la ligne 1-2-3 est la plus centrale et la plus pratique de NYC. son quartier est vraiment tres sympa en plus !!! Allez y les yeux fermés.[QWERTY123]I just got back from a trip to NYC during which I stayed at Stephanie's appartment. The bedroom and private bathroom that comes with it were both kept very clean and are spacious so that I could unpack my stuff and put my clothes away in the closet. I didn't have to live out of my rucksack for ten days which made me already feel comfortable.
The appartment is situated right at the north end of Central Park in Harlem and very close to different subway stations. I could either start my day with a morning stroll through the park and into the Upper West or Upper East Side, or catch the subway to get to Midtown, South Manhattan or Brooklyn in no time. So from a geographical vantage point the appartment is perfectly situated to discover the city.
But apart from all these facts it was above all Stephanie with her warm and welcoming nature that really made me feel comfortable during these days. It is very nice to come ""home"" in the evening, tired after a long day's strolling around, and end the day with a little chit-chat about one's experiences before falling into bed and, with thumb-in-mouth, sleep blissfully through till the next morning.
NYC, I will be back, and I know where I'll be staying! Thank you, Stephanie!!![QWERTY123]Stephanie's offered all the most important things: a warm welcome into a comfortable home; a comfortable bed in a quiet room; fresh & clean towels & blankets; and easy access to Manhattan.  Finding myself travelling to NYC in the future I feel I already have a open invitation to make home away from home through Stephanie's generousity.[QWERTY123]Stephanie was really nice, ftiendly and helpful. The room was perfect and it was very easy to go around the town from there. :-)[QWERTY123]I was pleasantly surprised with my whole stay at Stepahnie's place. She is the most warm hearted and interesting person and her family is the same.
The whole place is clean aand as described in the ad. I'd go there again any time and thank Stph again for the wonderful stay.
Thanx[QWERTY123]Stephanie's apt was great. Very convenient to anywhere in NYC you would want to go. Subway stop a block away. I would highly recommend staying there if you get a chance.[QWERTY123]my husband and i had such a great time staying with stephanie! we stayed at chez chic for 3 nights and felt right at home the minute we walked in.  the room is a perfect size, plenty of room for the two of us and a good sized closet for our suitcases, everything was immaculate, clean towels and linens, and the location is great.   not only is stephanie a great hostess, she is also a great resource for things to do in the city which made our stay even better.  i would recommend stephanie to anyone traveling to new york and we cant wait to get back to nyc to see her bed and breakfast![QWERTY123]When I first arrived at Stephanie's, she was very welcoming! I had no problem finding my way from the subway at Central Park North and I never felt unsafe walking from the subway to the apartment (a 5 min walk)When I got to the apartment complex at 7th ave (Chez Chic)there was no elevator but there was a really friendly neighbor that helped me carry my luggage up the stairs. I met Stephanie's very nice husband and her two beautiful children and they were never a bother! And she even let me use her laptop so I can check my email and keep in touch with my family.
I was free to come and go anytime I wanted to and having my own bathroom was a bonus! The bed was REALLY comfy, the air conditioning was a relief and the closet was spacious.
 Not too far up the street there was a 24 hour market that was awesome with a lot of great stuff to choose from so I was always able to make my own breakfast, lunch and dinner!! Going to and from uptown to midtown Manhattan was very easy and convenient with the subways running 24 hours (only a 25 min ride to Time Square) and there was always people around so you never felt alone!!
Over all I really enjoyed my stay at Chez Chic and New York was a great city! I recommend any place Stephanie has available!! 
Enjoy your time in New York![QWERTY123]awesome couldn't have been better.[QWERTY123]It was a great week at ""chez chic"". Stephanie and her family were really friendly and she gave us some advices to visit the town. The room was comfortable and the flat was really well situated (5 minutes from subway). We would recommend this place to anyone![QWERTY123]My friend and I stayed at the Chez Chic for ten days. Stephanie was a great host and has such a cute family! She was very easygoing and gave us nice advices going out in harlem so that we loved this place! Her apartment was nice, so that we really enjoyed our sojourn time and would come back any time. tahnks![QWERTY123]Wonderful hostess, kind, willing to help and offer advice.  We stayed at Chez Chic and enjoyed the premises and felt safe.  Great value as well. I would highly recommend her to anyone.  The site is close to the subway and you can move about the city very easily.
Dave and Denise[QWERTY123]Stephanie was the perfect host... welcoming and generous with her time.  She clued me in to some terrific local cafes and restaurants offering delicious food at reasonable prices and venues for jazz as well.  She even helped my son find the best and safest route to an event he had planned on attending with his college friends.  Overall very professional and accommodating.[QWERTY123]I was pleasantly surprised to see a clean room, elegantly decorated in a quiet flat within walking distance from Central Park. Stephanie is very helpful and her house deserves the title Chez Chic.[QWERTY123]What a great location and welcome from Stephanie and her family! We arrived late on Friday night and Stephanie was there to welcome us. She provided excellent local information and also directions to downtown, which proved vital on the day of the marathon. The room was excellent and the bed was very comfortable, was also great to come home to a warm house very night! Living with Stephanie and her family added to our New York experience and we would recommend it to anyone.

Thanks Stpehanie![QWERTY123]Wow..It was one of my best trip ever. My husband and I had an amazing time in Stephanie's Place. We stayed 3 days at her place. It was a super clean apartment and we had whatever we need in the apartment, like TV,Telephone,Internet,the clean towels and well equipped kitchen. I would definitely recommend the place and the Stephanie as a host. She is so nice and very helpful. Stephanie gave us a map of NYC and great tips on where to go. 
Thanks a lot dear Stephanie! You made our trip![QWERTY123]Stephanie was such a wonderful host! We were familiar with the NYC area but she went out of her way to make sure we knew how to get around her area in particular and had tons of suggestions for things to do and places to go. Everyone there was wonderful and she made us feel right at home. We had a great time and would consider her again when visiting New York City.[QWERTY123]It is an excellent place to stay! Clean, quiet, warm, everything is close, the park, the subway..
We had a great time there![QWERTY123]What a wonderful apartment and room! We stayed for two nights at the Chez Chic and it was lovely! Stephanie and her family were away on a trip so we had the whole apartment to ourselves -- which was incredible! Her wonderful friend Sophie helped us get all set up and keys and gave us a warm welcome. We will totally stay here again next time we are in the Big Apple and hopefully we'll get to meet Stephanie and her lovely family.[QWERTY123]My boyfriend and I stayed at the Chez Chic and it was absolutely fantastic! Stephanie is a very welcoming, open, and accommodating host. The neighborhood is lovely and picturesque. Stephanie has a sophisticated taste for interior design and art. (She also has the cutest kids!) 
The serene Central Park is down the street and the efficient subway is a block away. Our first-time stay in New York would not have been complete without this ""local"" experience.  We definitely recommend her to everyone and hope to cross paths again in the future.  :D  5 stars! Thank you, Stephanie![QWERTY123]NA[QWERTY123]Stephanie and her family are warm and welcoming, offering assistance and advice without being at all intrusive. The place is clean, in a dynamic neighborhood and close to central park and transport. People who have difficulties with stairs might wish to avoid this place as there are five floors to be negotiated to reach the front door.[QWERTY123]It was the 1st time my boyfriend and I were going to NYC!Our stay at stephanie's was just amazing!!!!We arrived late in the evening but stephanie was there to welcome us and give us lots of useful tips about New York!Her family is so friendly and her little son is so funny! The neighborhood is really pleasant!Her neighbors called her as we didn't have any service on our phone ! The apartment is very close to Central Park North and Harlem Meer (just a few steps to get there!)and also close to subway and bus station!
She always asked us if we needed anything!
You can go there with complete confidence you won't be disappointed! Trust me!

Some advice if you arrive at JFK and you don't want to spend too much money in transportation:Take the airtrain to Jamaica Station and then take the A line(subway)to Manhattan.Change at 42th Street Times Square to C line uptown and stop at 110th Street Cathedral Pkwy. Then you'll just have to walk 5 or 10 minutes and you'll be there!

[QWERTY123]Stephanie was a great host and the apartment suited our needs perfectly.
Thanks very much for being so kind and considerate on our first visit to the big apple!
Steve and Amanda[QWERTY123]My husband and i stayed with Stepanie and her family at the Chez Chic Private Room for 4 nights.  The accomodations were wonderful.  Stephanie was a fabulous hostess.  We had so much privacy that it felt like we were in our own apartment most of the time.  Stephanie was great with giving us directions and recommendations of places to eat and visit.  Everything was absolutely wonderful.  The room is very quiet and clean and comfortable.  Everything is exactly as Stephanie advertises.  My husband and I left the city with a new found appreciation for Harlem thanks to Stephanie and her family.  We absolutely cannot wait to stay with Stephanie again.  We would recommend her to anyone coming to NYC!!!!!! We already have multiple times.  Thank you Stephanie, for everything!!!! :)[QWERTY123]We had a wonderful experience with Stephanie!  Thank you!  We had our 11 mth old baby with us and she enjoyed it a lot as well.[QWERTY123]The host cancelled my reservation[QWERTY123]We had a very nice time in Stephanie 's appartement.
Stephanie lives in a nice and cosy appartment. 
we felt at home, 
We would recommand her place well located.

See you another time Stephanie.

Agathe and Yann.

[QWERTY123]Nous avons passé un agréable séjour chez Stéphanie et sa famille. Encore merci pour tous ces conseils et astuces![QWERTY123]Stephanie is a very welcoming host. All the family was very nice. It was a wonderful experience in NYC![QWERTY123]We spent a very pleasant stay at Stephanie's apartment. Everything was just perfect: the room, the bathroom and her welcoming family! The location of the apartment is also a strength (5-min walk from the subway - main lines and from Central Park). My sister and myself recommend you this place for your future stay in NY, you won't regret it ! =) Thanks again to Stephanie !!![QWERTY123]We stayed at the 111th Street apartment with Stephanie and her family. As an alternative to staying in an ""Overpriced"" New York tourist hotel, I'd recommend it to anyone. I'd stayed in NY a few times before and while this was the furthest Uptown I'd stayed, the access to transport is so easy (Ensure you buy an unlimited travel card) so no matter where we wanted to go it didn't take too long. If it's your first time in NY, Stephanie is able to advise on places to go and see.[QWERTY123]Stephanie and her family are friendly. They respected my privacy and the room was as I expected. The location of the apartment is very good for public transportation and the apartment is clean. I had a calm and pleasant stay there.[QWERTY123]We had a great time at Stephanies apartment - everything was perfect. The apartment is very well located. The subway is just around the corner and you can get fast to the Times Square. Stephanie and her family are very friendly and helpful. We recommend you this place for a stay in NY.[QWERTY123]It was the firts time we used airbnb and we are very happy of this experience.  Stephanie really made us feel welcome from the first second.The house is clean, warm, very quiet and the bed is extremely comfortable. Stephanie is a very helpful and informative host. As this was our first trip to NYC we were not sure which neighborhoods would be safe to stay in. Stephanie's home is in a quiet building and my boyfriend and I both felt very safe. We highly recommend staying in Stephanie's home. 
What can we say? All in our stay was great and we would definitely recommend Stephanie's places to our friends and to anyone. Much better than a hotel, and probably cheaper!   It's New York a great city and Stephanie is a perfect host. 
Thanks Stephanie. We will come back soon.[QWERTY123]Best host I ever had - Stefanie and her family are very kind, helpful and accommodating - you will feel at home here immediately. The place is very nice, clean and you can't beat the access to both the B and C as well as the 2 and 3 subway lines, both each 1.5 blocks away! Will definitely come back![QWERTY123]I had an extremely comfortable stay in ""chez chic guest room #1.""  Stephanie and her family are very nice and hospitable folks.  It was nice to feel at ""home"" while in NYC.[QWERTY123]It was very nice staying at Stephanie's place with her and her family. The room is confortable and the shared spaces as the kitchen and the bathroom were clean. 
The communication was excellent, very close to Central Park, the subway and buses. A perfect location to visit the museums: Guggenheim and MET are very close with the M4, M2 and M3 buses that take you through the 5th avenue, it’s a beautiful ride.
Thanks!
[QWERTY123]We had a wonderful time staying at Stephanie's and her family. To room was clean and provided anything we needed for our stay. We had our own shared bathroom and could also use the kitchen supplies. 
Stephanie and her family were very open to our questions and offered suggestions on things to see in New York.  
The area was perfectly located near two subway stations and close to the Harlem nightlife as well as Central Park. We can only recommend Stephanie's for any New York visitor.[QWERTY123]Nous sommes restés 5 nuits chez stephanie et sa petite famille. l'expérience était trés enrichissante et le logement était pratique, proche de toute commodité (2 stations de métro à proximité). Le quartier est trés sécurisant dans la partie rénové de harlem à deux pas de central park. Il y a de super resto dans le quartier. 
Le rapport qualité/prix est très correct et  Stéphanie à des bons tuyaux pour vous.[QWERTY123]Great accomodation in great location. The flat is clean and comfortable, Harlem is pictoresque and full of life, Central Park is next door. 
Stephanie and her little family are warm and welcoming. 
Jac e Raffi[QWERTY123]Very conveniently located just North of Central Park,out of the "" hussle and bussle "" and affordable, close to the subways,good for joggers and walkers in the park.Great hospitality, clean and neat. Coming from South Africa where there is little or no public transport, we found it so easy and accessible and we felt totally safe.Stephanie and her family made us feel so welcome and at home and we recommend this accommodation to those who are looking for a short or long stay. We stayed for 3 nights and if ever we should come back, we do know where we will stay ![QWERTY123]We had a great stay with Stephanie and her family : very welcome, good times shared together....The location is very well situated in a quiet neighborhood, close to public transport and Central park
A strongly advise !!


Bises à Spiderman :D

Leonella et Karine[QWERTY123]Parfait ! Pour nos amis Français, et pour tous ceux qui comprendront ce message,  qui hésitent encore  de voyager vers cette ville mystérieuse de New-York, n’hésitez plus en tant que hôte de Stéphanie. Sa gentillesse, sa disponibilité, son attachante petite famille, tout cela en préservant votre intimité vous raviront. Stéphanie n’est point avare de bons conseils et la situation de son hébergement facilite grandement la découverte de la « ville qui ne dort jamais » : un bloc de Central Park et  5 minutes du métro qui vous enverra  vers Manhattan et au cœur de Harlem (quartier très sûr).
Encore une fois, avec Stéphanie, votre séjour n’en sera que plus agréable et nous la remercierons jamais assez.
Karine et Ludo.
[QWERTY123]Nice family, nice and clean apartment, good location. It takes only twenty minutes to Times Square. Stephanie is very friendly and very helpful. She knows a lot about the city and gives good insider tips. They provided us with maps of the area, the Metro and more. Also, towels, an adapter and an umbrella were present. We felt very welcome and can recommend a stay with Stephanie a lot.[QWERTY123]I WILL BE BACK IN THIS ROOM[QWERTY123]Beautiful room with all the amenities (cable tv, nice bathroom, kitchen access and a/c) with the added benefit of little Mr Princeton for entertainment- don't miss out on his Michael Jackson impersonation/dancing. Priceless :D[QWERTY123]The host canceled my reservation 19 days before arrival.[QWERTY123]Stephanie is a wonderful woman and I loved her family and their hospitality, I'll definitely will keep in touch for future visits to New York City.[QWERTY123]Stéphanie et sa famille sont des gens adorables, très accueillants et toujours disponibles. L'appartement est exactement comme dans la description, joliment décoré et bien situé, à deux pas du métro. Stéphanie nous a donné plein de bons conseils durant notre séjour, et c'est sans hésiter que nous choisirons à nouveau de loger chez eux lors de notre prochain voyage à NY ! Merci pour tout...[QWERTY123]Très bien accueillis par une amie de la famille. L'appartement est très propre et bien situé. Nous avons pu être parfaitement indépendant et bien profiter de NY.
(Heureusement la chambre était climatisée parce qu'il a fait une chaleur difficilement supportable.)
C'est un très bon séjour.
Très envie de revenir vite!![QWERTY123]The room was nice and clean and conformed exactly to the description on airbnb. It was calm and the closet offered a lot of space to put away all my belongings. The kitchen and the living room can be used generously. And to have a bathroom of your own, sometimes shared with guests from the other room, is very agreeable. To be so near to Central Park and the Subway is wonderful either. And Harlem has its own special charm: It is a very varied sort of village within the Big Apple.
For the lovely opportunity to enjoy this fascinating city, I'm very grateful.[QWERTY123]We stayed at the Chez Chic budget room for a week. Stephanie was a great host, she respected our privacy and she provided us with information about the neighbourhood. The room is quite spacious en very clean. The bathroom is shared with other guests, but although the other room was constantly occupied, we practically never had to wait for the bathroom to be free. The wireless internet worked just fine, just as the television with digital channels. 
There are two subway stations at approximately 4-5 min walking distance. Lines 2,3, B and C depart form these stations. We felt safe in the neighourhood. Overall, we would definately recommend to stay at this apartment![QWERTY123]I went by Stephanie's place with my mother and she set up everything for us when we arrived, better than a hotel! we didn't spend much more time with her as we were visiting a lot. She make us feel being independant which is nice. We could use the kitchen in the morning. It was simple, clear efficient, close to the metro. The place is quiet, there are not so many bars around, but we went to the bier restaurant nearby which is good and serve quite late, passed 10:30pm![QWERTY123]Perfect room for staying for short stays in NY and good acces to the subway to get around the city.
[QWERTY123]Delightful host and family.  Very accommodating despite being only 3 weeks post partum!!  Very well located.[QWERTY123]Stephanie made us feel right at home! The week we were there, another couple was renting the room across the hall, but we rarely saw them. My fiance and I spent a week here for multiple different interviews in the city, and we had no problem getting anywhere from this location. There was easy access to multiple subway lines.[QWERTY123]Felt very welcome, comfortable and safe since our arrival.  The place was very clean, the bathroom was clean and spacious.  The room has a useful big closet and it was very quiet.  We could use the kitchen any time in the day to make tea and coffee. Being a block from central park was a real treat.  The neighborhood was interesting although there were some streets that looked rough but we didn't have any problems at all.  There are plenty of good restaurants and bars in Harlem if you want to explore the area.  I would definitely come back to stay here and I will recommend it to my friends.[QWERTY123]great location. great host.[QWERTY123]Spent two nights and it was perfect!  Close to several subways/bus stops and a nice, quiet neighborhood.  The room was huge and bathroom very clean (even while sharing with guests in another room).  Stephanie and her family were very kind and welcoming.  I can't not say enough wonderful things about my experience!  The only thing is beware that the building has no elevator and is a bit of a climb to the apartment.  It isn't too bad since you're not in NYC to stay in your room :-)[QWERTY123]The appartment was great, in a really nice location and we had a great time there. The room was big, clean, and well decorated, we really enjoyed staying there![QWERTY123]L'appartement est bien située, propre et disposant de tout le nécessaire pour pouvoir passer un agréable séjour  : idéal pour un couple. Ses gérantes ont su nous accueillir chaleureusement et n'ont pas hésité à nous aider à plusieurs reprises lorsque nous faisions appel à elles (petit plus non négligeable en cas de gros problème : elles parlent français) Nous recommandons vivement ![QWERTY123]Staying at Chez Chic #1 was just what I had wanted.  The accomodation were clean and quiet - the value was fantastic!  Stephanie was very patient - my plans changed multiple times; and she and Sophie were both very quick to respond to the couple of problems that arose during my stay.  Getting there by the M60 and M2 buses was fast and easy.  The location is great.  Although I didn't have a chance to go into Central Park, it was wonderful to have that greenery so close by.  There's a corner grocery store right across the street.[QWERTY123]Stephanie and Sophie's place was great! Our schedules didn't end up lining up so we didn't get to meet them in person but they were very prompt and helpful when answering questions before our arrival. The room and apartment were very clean, comfortable and quiet! Being right next to Central Park was fantastic too. I'd recommend staying here![QWERTY123]This is a great place to stay when you are visiting New York. The rooms are tidy and tastefully decorated. Our room had a TV and plenty of space to store our luggage. We also had access to a fully equipped kitchen which is great if you want to cook, although you probably won’t because you will find great restaurants and markets in Harlem and in the Upper West side nearby. The subway and Central Park are both one block away and the neighborhood is safe to navigate even at night. Columbia University and the Riverside Park are just blocks away and definitely worth a visit.[QWERTY123]Superbe appartement. En revanche, attention, la description ne correspond pas tout à fait. En effet, il s'agit d'un appartement dont toutes les chambres sont louées et non pas d'une chambre d'hôte chez l'habitant. L’ambiance est donc dépendante des autres colocataires. Sur ce point, nous n'avons eu aucun problèmes. 
L'appartement est idéalement placé, à 5min à pied des métros, de Central Park et de nombreux commerces. Le quartier est aussi très bien, contrairement aux idées reçues, l'atmosphère y est très agréable.

Nous reviendrons sans problème :)[QWERTY123]Стефани - хороший хозяин. Она без проблем и вовремя встретила нас. С ней можно связаться в любое время по телефону, если будут какие-либо трудности.
 Дом имеет удобное расположение, находится рядом с центральным парком, недалеко есть 2 станции метро.
В квартире есть все что нам было нужно - кухня, ванная, спальня, интернет. Летом в Нью-Йорке душно, спасал кондиционер. В целом - все понравилось, спасибо хозяевам.[QWERTY123]I recommend everyone to stay in Stephanie's house. If you have any doubt... Just send me a message! It was my best choice. Very clean, place to put your food in the kitchen, the family is awesome!
Subway very near. 
When you arrive to the house, Steph has for you information about supermarkets, transport, subway map, the wifi password... all!
[QWERTY123]Lovely simple room and comfortable bed. Very clean. No view but excellent aircon! Great location for exploring manhattan and walks in central park. Stephanie was charming and very helpful. Excellent value for money.[QWERTY123]Nous avons vraiment adoré notre séjour chez Stéphanie. Tres accueillante et qui a su prendre le temps de nous donner de nombreux questions. Toujours disponible.
Le logement est tres bien situé, au calme et avec toutes les commodités nécessaires. Si nous devions retourner à New York, ce serait inévitablement chez Stéphanie. Mélanie & Anthony[QWERTY123]We had such an amazing experience staying over stephanie's place. We didn't have a specific time to arrive because we came from abroad, but she was very flexible with this. Arriving there, she was very kind by giving us a map from the subway and all the restaurants around and giving us tips about New York. She showed us the house and made us very comfortable staying there. 
We could use the kitchen, the fridge and the phone. We had wi-fi that worked normally (thank God!!!)
The room was perfectly clean and organized, with AC, TV, towels, clean sheets, fan, etc.  The bathroom was very clean too. 
Not to mention that there are two subway stations less than a block away, which makes everything so easy. We bought a 7-day pass and in 10 minutes from the place, we were downtown. 
In a nutshell, I don't have anything bad to say about the place at all. Actually, the opposite. I deeply recommend staying there and if I have to go to NYC again, that's the place I will stay.[QWERTY123]Stephanie and her husband are very friendly, open minded people. They have a lot of experience in hosting people, you can check in in no time and they have all the information about the room, apartment and also the neighbourhood ready, as well as a city map. They helped us a lot with useful tips!
The room is very comfortable and looks chic and nicely decorated. Stephanie provides towels and the bath room is tidy and quite clean.
They are very nice people and I would stay there again anytime.[QWERTY123]Stephanie and her family were excellent hosts. They helped us a lot with their hints (were to go at nights and were to buy good food at low cost). They were very kind and  the apartment were we stayed at was great. It is close to the subway and buses, and only 2 blocks away from Central Park. It was a pleasure to stay there!. It's been really a pleasure to meet you. Thanks a lot.[QWERTY123]I stayed with Stephanie and I felt like home!! Stephanie and her family are very nice and helpful... They answered all my questions... gave directions, maps, etc. The apartament is very cozy and the neighborhood is friendly. I really recommend stay with her!! 

Ficar na apartamento da Stephanie foi uma experiência a parte. Ela e sua família são muito legais.... me ajudaram com tudo que precisei. Até informações específicas sobre locais  ela conseguiu encontrar para mim. Eu recomendo 100% ficar no apartamento dela.... não irão se arrepender. Eu ficarei novamente lá da próxima vez que eu for a NYC.[QWERTY123]An unforgettable trip to NYC. Fantastic city with crazy people an much to see.[QWERTY123]I needed a home for the week while I was looking for an apartment and Stephanie's apartment was the perfect spot! Clean common areas, friendly family, and a very comfortable and spacious room![QWERTY123]It's a comfortable and cozy room. Stephanie is very nice and friendly.[QWERTY123]I was staying in this apartment only for 3 days. It's really good place to stay in NYC. The apartment is big enough and very comfortable. Only 3 min walking to subway and Central Park. The father of a family with a small lovely child took me so warm! He was really fan and glad to help me.
Room furnished pleasantly and has everything. Bathroom is shared but I have never encountered someone because they have another bathroom.
I did not use the kitchen but Abdul showed me where I can put my stuff. Because of the big size of apartment no one bothers to each other and I didn't hear any noise. 
I recommend this apartment for your travel![QWERTY123]My wife and I stayed at Stephanie for 3 nights. We haven't met our host as we were out most of the time. Our stay was fine. The location of the apartment is good as being very close to main metro station and front of Central Park and the neighborhood is quite. The room is of a correct size (we are in NYC) and was clean at our arrival; just to mention that the a/c is noisy and despite the a/c and the fan in the room, we felt somehow hot (during summer). The bathroom is fine but to share with another room.[QWERTY123]It was a decent location. People who want to visit n do touristy stuff, I suggest live closer to lower west side of manhattan. 

Although no complaints about the place or stephanie. The place is really close to blue and red line subways. You get your own set of house keys, so you can come in and go out anytime you want.

Very comfortable stay[QWERTY123]Great location on Central Park North, close to the subway, easy access, safe zone. Plenty of room. No regrets![QWERTY123]Stephanie and her familly were very nice. We spent very good time with them. We will go back there, for sure, next time we will go to NYC !![QWERTY123]Stephanie and her family were wonderful. Great location and clean room. Excellent subway access and right near central park.[QWERTY123]Everything was great. The room was big and clean. They were lovely people with us. We had a great week in NYC, and they were part of that. Thank you![QWERTY123]Séjour de rêve. Stéphanie toujours à l'écoute et à vous donner un conseil. Appartement très cocooning, idéalement situé pour rayonner sur Manhattan (pieds, métro ou bus). Un seul regret : 1 semaine c'est trop court. Nous reviendrons[QWERTY123]Our stay was very pleasant and good. It was close to the subway and places to eat. Stephanie kept it clean and neat. The only thing was that was an inconvenient was that the AC made a lot of noise the first night but worked perfectly fine the second. I would surely recommend this place to others.[QWERTY123]We only stayed two night, but the room was very comfortable and beautiful! We got our own set of keys to the apartment, and it was within short walking distance to the metro. Stephanie is a very considerate and accommodating host![QWERTY123]Really nice to stay there, thanks a lot. Comfortable place and good location.[QWERTY123]Perfecto (*****). Era la primera vez que usábamos Airbnb. Stephanie es maravillosa, atenta y simpática. La habitación es comoda, silenciosa y muy ordenada. Buen comunicado en metro. Si  duda, yo le digo que volvería a este lugar.

Perfect (*****). It was the first time we used Airbnb. Stephanie is wonderful, helpful and friendly. The room is comfortable, quiet and very tidy. The house is well connected with the metro. I would definitely return to this place.[QWERTY123]Ma mère et moi avons séjourné 8 nuits chez Stéphanie et sa famille. 
C'est un grand et bel appartement fonctionnel et décoré avec goût. Tous les critères pour passer de bonnes vacances sont réunis : chambre et salle de bain spacieuses et équipées, ménage impeccable. À moins de 5 minutes à pieds des lignes de métro 2,3,A,B,C,D : un bonheur pour découvrir la grande pomme.
Je recommande fortement cette location quelque soit votre situation (seul, en couple, entre amis en famille).
Stéphanie et ses proches vous accueillent chaleureusement et vous donnent pleins de conseils avisés pour passer un excellent moment.
J'y retournerai :) 
Merci pour cette superbe semaine![QWERTY123]Stephanie and her family were amazing hosts. So accommodating and so pleasant. I felt so well taken care of while I was there. The apartment is lovely, and very very convenient to several subway stops. I would highly recommend Stephanie and her rooms to anyone looking for a comfortable, quiet, and inviting place to stay.[QWERTY123]We had a nice experience at Stephanie's place.
She was very welcoming and full of wise advices.
The appartment is really well located and is good value for money for Manhattan... A great place for your stay in NYC!
[QWERTY123]Stephanie and her international family are really amazing hosts. we arrived at NY on a chilly morning and she offered us a hot drinks and whatever info we need for transpiration, etc. The room was cozy and well organized. we had great fun in NY. we love her kids, they are really cute, especially the youngest. it was a pretty convenient neighborhood. Steph also gave us some lists about the great places to eat and hangout nearby. but in NY, i think we better not go home late coz its not very safe out there at night. anyway, we enjoyed our stay and we love Steph's place and her family.[QWERTY123]Stephanie and her family were always available, helpful and nice to us. Eventhough the bedroom and the apartment were a little smaller than they appeared in the pictures, they were still very nice looking, clean and cozy. The bed is fantastic - you'll want to sleep a bit more! We found the neighborhood safe, but some nights, when I came home late and alone, some men did bother me on the street from the subway to the apartment. Nothing serious, though - just a little annoying. Apart from that, the location is very good. We found everything we needed within 5min of walk (dining, laundry). There are two subway lines also within 5min of walk. One of them is express and takes you to Times Square in 15min.  It is also very nice to be so close to the Central Park and to take walks over there sometimes. Overall, staying with Stephanie and her family was a very nice experience. We recommend and would definetely stay there again if we come back to NYC![QWERTY123]Nous avons bien apprécié l'accueil sympathique de Stéphanie durant notre semaine à New York. L'appartement est idéalement situé pour atteindre facilement tous les quartiers (métro et bus tout proches), et très calme.
A noter : le partage de la salle de bains avec plusieurs hôtes peut entraîner une attente un peu gênante… Malgré cela, nous avons bien profité de cet hébergement et aimé la ""petite famille"" de Stéphanie.[QWERTY123]La experiencia fue buenísima. Era la primera vez que usábamos airbnb y no podía ser mejor. Tanto la localización como Stephanie que fue muy amable y nos ayudó en todo lo que pudo. Una familia maravillosa.[QWERTY123]Stephanie est tres sympathique. Le quartier est assez sympa et la chambre confortable[QWERTY123]Hello

I just came back from my trip to NYC. Stephanie and her family are adorable and very helpful. The pictures are really accurate and the appartment is very clean also. The location is perfect to enjoy NYC at his best.
I will definitely go back there if i need a room in NYc.

Maty[QWERTY123]Stephanie, her husband and the kids were great. We really enjoyed our stay and would recommend it to anyone who plans to go to New York. The room, the bathroom and the kitchen were exactely like in the pictures. The information that Stephanie sent us beforehand made it easy to find the appartement and were a great guide to our first days with all the recommendations, a Subway map and much more! We would defenitely come back and stay there again. It's a great deal for a good prize![QWERTY123]The reservation was canceled the day before arrival. This is an automated posting.[QWERTY123]Chambre bien équipée et très bien située. Stéphanie nous a conseillée sur des endroits où aller (diner, gospel....), tous très bien. Je vous le conseille. A bientôt[QWERTY123]Felt very welcome, host and her husband were very friendly. Had maps and coupons and restaurant/shopping guides for us ready to use, very helpful :) Good AC in the room which was fantastic! Apartment was pretty full of people, so if you want a more private stay, might not be the best, but everyone was respectful and your room was a very private space. Would recommend staying here :)[QWERTY123]Our stay with Stephanie was great. The neighborhood is very close to the metro, great resturants, and Central Park. Our room was comfortable and quiet. It was just what we needed. Thank you Stephanie! I'm sure we'll be back.[QWERTY123]Quedarnos en la casa de Stephanie fue una experiencia increíble!, el apartamento queda muy bien ubicado a pocas cuadras de Central Park y muy cerca al metro, es un ambiente familiar, tienes tu espacio y una estancia muy tranquila ya que una vez llegas te entregan las llaves y mapas de la zona,  el barrio es muy tranquilo y bastante seguro, aunque no nos vimos todo el tiempo con ella nos sentimos como en casa, teníamos toda la privacidad de mundo, la habitación es acogedora y lo suficientemente amplia para dos personas, adicional no había problemas con el horario de llegada, la comunicación fue excelente pues ella habla varios idiomas con fluidez, al frente del edifico queda un lugar llamado cantina también muy acogedor perfecto para tomar un par de cervezas y comer en las noches, es mi primera experiencia con Airbnb y creo que solo tengo cosas buenas para decir, solo recomiendo que confíen en los comentarios que se escriben yo me guié por esto y nos fue demasiado bien! En cuanto a NY sin palabras , es una ciudad increíble y siempre queras volver a ella, solo que ahora sentimos que tenemos un lugar donde siempre podremos llegar que es donde Stephanie![QWERTY123]Great room, close to the subway. Stephanie was very helpful and did her best to make our stay enjoyable! :)[QWERTY123]Stephanie is a wonderful host, we received a warm welcome and helpful tips upon our arrival. Our questions were promptly answered and she helped us getting from the airport to the apartment.
Her children are very cute and playful, a heart-melting sight :)

The room is nice and clean, there's a master double bed as well as an auxiliary single bed that doubles as a sofa. A pleasant surprise was that there was a safe in the room we could use as well as we could lock the room doors. While we had felt secure and safe in the apartment, it's nice to have a safe to leave stuff in instead of hauling it across the city.

There is a guest bathroom that is shared with one more guest, clean and pristine!

The neighbourhood is great, very close to central park and the subway as well as near to plenty of good restaurants.

I'd definitely recommend staying at this place and would certainly stay here again when in in NYC.[QWERTY123]Stephanie was very hospitable to both me and my wife during our short stay in New York this winter. I must say we were very excited to get to the beautiful place few meters close to the northern central park after having a long flight from the south of States. She got in touch with us in the early morning of our arrival day and was absolutely in time at home waiting for us to come. We got the keys from our room and appartment, listened to the short, but highly valuable how-to-use instructions and peacefully enjoyed our trip for all the days left.
Thank you very much, you are all amazing

Alexei and Marianna[QWERTY123]
Stephanie and her family were welcoming and easy to live alongside. The room was clean and warm- perfect For the snowy nights of our stay there. The family has  children but they were well behaved and didn't get up too early.  The location of the apartment is great- 2 blocks from a subway station ! This was my first airbnb experience and it was definitely a pleasant one.[QWERTY123]Stephanie had an emergency situation and couldn't host us at the last minute so we never met her. She made arrangements for us to stay at a budget hotel near by. The hotel was less than ideal but I was grateful to not have to make new arangments myself with one days notice.[QWERTY123]Stephanie greeted my son and I warmly; made us feel completely welcome. She and her family are genuinely kind-hearted people, the boys are so well mannered, so sweet. 1 block to the subway, she had maps to various attractions, numerous suggestions/ directions for restaurants, and took the time to thoroughly answer all questions; an enormous help![QWERTY123]Stéphanie nous a accueilli à bras ouvert malgré notre arrivée tardive. Elle nous a immédiatement donnée des indications pour New York et à été très sympa jusqu'au bout de notre séjour. Je recommande fortement son logement car la chambre est confortable ainsi que la salle de bain. Je reviendrai ![QWERTY123]Stephanie made us both very welcome. The location is great, close to restaurants and bars, as well as Central Park and subways.
The room was comfortable and clean, and her family were lovely. We will definitely stay here again if we are back in New York.[QWERTY123]Good host and good experience in Stephanie's apartment.[QWERTY123]Stéphanie et Sophie nous ont chaleureusement accueill. L'appartement se situe au centre-ville, y a plusieur stations de métro dans les alentours. C'est pratique d'aller partout, n'importe quand.  La chambre est agréable, avec un grand lit et un lit de réserve. Tous sont y équipés, on a même acheté des cerises et les a partagés avec le hôte:)   Grosso modo, c'est une expérience très inoubliable! Je ne l'oublierai jamais. Merci beaucoup![QWERTY123]Unsere Gastgeber waren sehr freundlich und hilfsbereit und die Unterkunft genau so wie in der Beschreibung. Zwei verschiedene Ubahnstationen waren super zu erreichen und es gibt direkt einen Supermarkt mit allem nötigen.[QWERTY123]挺不错的.[QWERTY123]Appartement idéalement placé pour un jogging à Central Park.
Chambre conforme à la description mais pas la salle de bain. Celle ci, partagée, est restée sale tout au long du séjour. 
Accueil pas à la hauteur de nos espérance tout comme les conseils de visites qui sont restés inexistants.
[QWERTY123]The host canceled this reservation 14 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.[QWERTY123]I HIGHLY RECOMMEND staying here. The host, Stephanie, is very kind and was very welcoming. The room is clean and comfortable, and the bathroom was also clean and had good water pressure.  I also really like how the room is located right next to the front door so I could come and go without feeling like I was disturbing anyone. Next time I come to New York I will definitely stay here again because its in a GREAT LOCATION, right next to central park, a subway stop, and a Starbucks.[QWERTY123]Le quartier est très bien situé, juste au nord de Central Park. Aspect résidentiel.
Stéphanie nous a très bien renseignées sur les possibilités de visites et les choses spécifiques que nous voulions trouver.
Le logement était propre.
Connexion transports en commun à proximité.[QWERTY123]A Stephanie foi espectacular.. Fala Inglês e francês.. Muito atenciosa.. Super simpatica.. A casa e num lugar sossegado e ao pe da estacao do metro e entrada norte do Central Park.. Se la voltar é la que fico de certeza. Obrigado.
Stephanies was very nice and helped a lot. Gave us maps, advices, a clean room and bathroom. Very nice person. Speaks english and french. The house is near the subway and north entrance to Central Park. Peacefull place. Everything OK. If i go to New York again i will stay at her place again for sure. Thank u.[QWERTY123]The listing description was very accurate. Very comfortable and clean. bathroom and kitchen area always clean and very accessible.   Upon arrival we were given maps and Stephanie explained the subway lines very clearly. Apartment was no more than 5 minute walk from 2 different subway lines. Very easy to get around. Central park was essentially across the street. Area felt very safe. Stephanie was very helpful and accommodating when we had questions, was always able to point us in the right direction. Very approachable, friendly. Beautiful family very respectful of us! Would definitely book through her again!
[QWERTY123]Nice Place. Close to the Metro! Great Host![QWERTY123]La casa es tal y como se describe, limpia, acogedora y a solo 2 minutos andando del metro, junto a Central Park, en una zona muy tranquila y segura. Stephanie, su marido y sus hijos han sido muy amables con nosotros. Nos han ayudado en todo lo que hemos necesitado y han contestado todas nuestras preguntas. Son gente muy simpatica que nos han hecho sentir como en casa. Si alguna vez volvemos a Nueva York no dudaremos en ponernos en contacto con ellos otra vez. Muchas gracias por todo.[QWERTY123]La experiencia en casa de Mizi ha sido estupenda, nos ha hecho sentir como si estuviésemos en casa, el primer día nos explicó todo lo necesario de la casa y además dudas sobre ny. Cualquier duda que pudimos tener, hizo lo posible por resolverla. Además con el metro en 15 minutos estábamos en Times Square y en 30 en South Ferry. Sin duda volvería a alojarme en su casa.[QWERTY123]96년에 몇달 지냈던 맨하튼이었습니다.
그때는 할렘을 매우 무려워서 근처도 안갔었어요.
그런데 이번에 가보니 생각보다 깨끗하고 안전했습니다. 파킹도 스트릿에 용이하게 할수있었구요.
주변에 지하철도 매우 가까웠습니다. 식당도 여러가지 종류로 다있엇구요.
여러모로 참 편하게 지내다 왔습니다.[QWERTY123]Mizi is a wonderful host. The checking in to the appartment was totaly easy and uncomplicated. Around the corner is a good supermarket and two subway stations are only two minutes away. It was very easy to get downtown. And of course the central park right outside the door is just amazing, especially in the summer. Clean towels were available and we had our own bath room. I would definitly recommend this place and I will come back to New York for sure.[QWERTY123]The host canceled this reservation 41 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.[QWERTY123]Mizi was extremely friendful, she allowed to check in early in the morning, helped us to orient in the city. The flat is located in quite and peaceful district, near the bus and underground stations. We surely will recommend this flat to our friends.[QWERTY123]Everything was great! Being our first time in New York City we immediately felt welcomed before our arrival and once we actually arrived. We took an early fight to NYC on Friday so we could have the whole day to explore and when letting Mizi know this before booking our flights she was more than willing to accommodate us this early. How many hotels can you check into this early? Not many. This option and Mizi's flexibility to work with us allowed us to make the most out of our time in NYC since we were only there for the weekend. Mizi just let us know to text her when we were leaving the airport so that she could be ready for our arrival. A plus is that the LaGuardia airport was only 15 minutes away! We arrived to Mizi's around 8:45am and she welcomed us with open arms. 

Mizi was great and the hospitality was superb. When we first arrived she informed us of our accommodations and was kind enough to sit down with us an explain where everything was located in the city. She was very helpful and directed us to the closet metros, gave us a map, told us where Times Square was, assisted us with local dining questions, and overall made our time memorable. Even though there were other people occupying other spaces within the home even they were nice! Everyone was willing to give advice and showed us a great time. While she had a family everyone was still extremely respectful and pleasant. 

Mizi made sure that we had an extra key to the apartment which was great in case we wanted to come in and out as we pleased. The rooms were positioned at the front of the home, so it was easy to come in without disturbing the family. We made sure our noise was limited as we respected the host's wishes, but she made sure that we were also having a good time; she even invited us to an event she was hosting in NYC!!!

The neighborhood was close to many things and local restaurants were only blocks away. Harlem Tavern, which was only blocks away, is a nice place to go eat and is fairly priced too. Harlem Tavern stays open late, has a great selection of food, and has a wide variety of music that they play in the restaurant; Mizi recommended it and we gave it a A+. If we ever visit NYC again we will definitely say with Mizi. 

The hospitality was great and could not have been better elsewhere! The room was spacious enough for two people, had closet space, a tv, chair, trash can, etc and the apartment had Wi-Fi!!! The room and bathroom space were always clean as well!!! If you are looking for something cost efficient, in a good location, and has great hospitality check this Chic living space out!!! Thanks Mizi!!! :)[QWERTY123]Stephanie rulez! Everything was great. Don't be a fool - visit her! Feel the Bern! Axel[QWERTY123]El apartamento de Mizi está muy bien situado, justo al lado de Central Park (Norte), en un barrio familiar y seguro, con bares, restaurantes y un supermercado a la vuelta de la esquina. Tiene las lineas de metro 2, 3 (Website hidden by Airbnb) unos pocos minutos. 
La habitación estaba limpia y tenia todas las comodidades (mesa con TV y espacio para el portátil, wifi, butaca, armario empotrado y una estantería muy práctica). También tuvimos toallas limpias y un secador de pelo. El baño lo compartimos con otra pareja pero esto no fue un problema en absoluto. 
En cuanto a la cocina, es familiar y acogedora (incluso un día había flores naturales!). Tuvimos acceso a ella por completo y también nos ofrecieron café para desayunar. 
Aunque conocimos a Mizi unos días después de alojarnos en su apartamento porque se encontraba de viaje, el primer día su compañero nos recibió muy simpáticamente. Ambos en todo momento nos hicieron sentir como en casa y respondieron todas nuestras dudas sobre el transporte y la ciudad. También nos recomendaron supermercados y bares con música en vivo. 
Alojarnos en su casa fue un acierto.[QWERTY123]The host canceled this reservation the day before arrival. This is an automated posting.[QWERTY123]Thank you very much for our days with you, and thank you very much for all the tips you gave us. 
I will definitively come back the next time I am coming to NYC![QWERTY123]A família de Stephanie é linda, nos deixaram super confortáveis, e nos ajudaram sempre que precisamos, dando milhares de dicas turísticas, e sendo super flexíveis quanto ao check-in e check-out.
O bairro é SUPER tranquilo e seguro, estações de metro muito próximas!!
Compartilhamos o banheiro com outros viajantes de outro quarto. 
Eles demoravam apenas para trocar o lixo do banheiro e repor papel higienico.. De resto, tudo perfeito! (:

Beautiful home and family!!
Made us feel comfortable!
Clean, and lovely home.
We had such a great time!!!
thanks for all![QWERTY123]Good stay! Everything was nice and clean. Really convenient with the subway too.[QWERTY123]Stephanie is an awesome host! Its our first time in the US, and we were grateful for the top from her even before we got on to the taxi to get to her place. Her family is superbly lovely and the place is very easy to find and so close to different lines on 110th street that allows us to do so many things in the 3 days we are in NY. I would highly recommend this place and would love to be back for my next NY trip![QWERTY123]We had a great time in New York, everything regarding the accommodation went smooth and very uncomplicated. Everything was clean and we felt very welcomed from the beginning to the end.[QWERTY123]Los anfitriones son excelentes personas, tratan de ayudar en todo momento y nos comparten sus experiencias
[QWERTY123]It's a very convinenient place. Very close to buses and subway. Host is very nice.[QWERTY123]We spent two Nights at Mizi's place. Everything was very clean, the Location is Perfect. There are Subway Stations close to the Apartment, as well as a Bus stop. Central Park is a Minute away and there are many Bars and Restaurants in this area. Mizi was a very welcoming host and helped us with whataver we needed. We would definitely come back next time![QWERTY123]The room was not the same as showed in the room page, smaller and with a small size bed. The shared bathroom was not that clean, partly caused by the other guest who were sharing it, that left dirt and their used belongings and towels everywhere all the 4 days I stayed there (despite house rules were very clear about it). Host is friendly and kindly provided informations and services needed, but I advice little more care about the accomodation for the future. All the many others positive reviews could not be mistaking, so I hope mine was just a ""not so lucky"" situation.[QWERTY123]The apartment is under some renovation work (painting, rearrangement etc.) during our stay. The room is not exactly the same as the pictures. Overall is acceptable. And Stephanie is willing to offer help. My friend was sick at the beginning of our trip and feels better after having some food and drinks from Stephanie. She is a nice host.[QWERTY123]Personne tres sympathique
la chambre est trop petite et ne correspond pas du tout a la photo
un lit superpose sur le grang lit
peu donner un sentiment de clostrophobie[QWERTY123]We had a great stay at Stephanie's in Harlem. She and her husband were very friendly, helpful and made us feel like home. The room and bathroom were clean and the house has a great location. Central Park is just across the street and there are several subway lines nearby. The neighborhood seemed like a safe place when we walked home around 3 AM. If you plan a trip to New York this is an excellent place to start your adventure.[QWERTY123]Bella casa, a pochi passi dalla metro, famiglia molto accogliente, ospitale e gentile, Harlem è un quartiere da scoprire e partendo da qui è assolutamente più bello e interessante[QWERTY123]La casa de Mizi se encuentra muy bien ubicada, a 1 cuadra del lado norte del Central Park. La zona es tranquila, hay restaurantes alrededor. La estación de metro y autobus quedan cerca, lo cual es muy conveniente. La habitación es realmente cómoda y tiene todo lo que buscábamos. Mizi fue muy amable con nosotros cada vez que la vimos. Muy recomendable![QWERTY123]Overall, the place is at a pretty great location. It's close to subway stations and the area is pretty safe. The room, however, looks different from the photos provided. The bathrooms  oils be cleaner. The sink has dust all over it and the trash can is almost always full. Had to write messages to the host so they could take out the trash and replace the toilet paper. Went a night without toilet papers. But the hosts are nice and the home is pretty good.[QWERTY123]Ich habe den Aufenthalt bei Stephanie sehr genossen. Aus Umständen kam ich leider erst um 11 Uhr abends an, aber Stephanie hat auf mich gewartet und mich herzlich empfangen, trotz dass es so spät war. Da ich ihre Nummer hatte, hat die Kommunikation super geklappt. Da ich während meines Aufenthalts sehr viel Sightseeing gemacht habe, war ich nur abends im Apartment. Aber ich hatte Ruhe und konnte mich dort nach dem langen Tag gut entspannen, auch wenn man vom Flur Stimmen oder Schritte hört. Das Zimmer und Apartment ist kleiner, als es auf den Fotos scheint, doch ist sehr gemütlich und heimisch. Das Zimmer und Bad war sauber und schön eingerichtet. Die Matratze war für mich ein bisschen zu hart, trotzdem konnte ich gut schlafen. Auch dass ich das Bad mit anderen teilen musste, war kein Problem. Es war immer frei, wenn ich es benutzen wollte. Stephanie ist eine sehr liebe und sympathische Frau und auch ihr Mann und Kinder sind sehr nett und respektieren die Privatsphäre ihrer Gäste. Ich denke, sie sind es schon gewohnt Gäste zu haben. Meinen Koffer durfte ich bis zu meinem Rückflug, auch wenn ich ausgecheckt hatte, im Apartment lassen. Ich kann sie nur empfehlen![QWERTY123]Nuestra estadia en la casa de Mizi fue increible, no tuvimos ningun problema. Es una casa de familia, todos muy respetuosos y amables. Es muy recomendable, se encuentra a una cuadra del central park y a dos  cuadras las estaciones de subte. Gracias a Mizi y su familia por la hospitalidad.[QWERTY123]This place was awesome! Close to bike rentals, Central Park, and subway! Cute little Mexican restaurant right across the street! Super sweet host![QWERTY123]Todo bastante bien, ubicación al lado de central park y de línea de metro. Mizi nos ayudo en todo lo que necesitamos, cualquier duda nos la resolvió. Bastante recomendable[QWERTY123]Our stay was very pleasent. We felt welcome from the moment they opened the door. We became very helpful information about food stores that sell fresh and healthy food and the subway system which has to nearby stations but is a bit confusing at the beginning.  The room had enough space and the bed felt very comfortable. We would defenetly book here again![QWERTY123]Mizi ha sido muy buena anfitriona desde el primer momento que llegamos a su casa. 
La comunicación con ella ha sido inmejorable. La habitación cumplía todos los requisitos. 
Si volviéramos a Nueva York repetiríamos la estancia.[QWERTY123]Extremely kind, accommodating & knowledgeable[QWERTY123]We had a great time and felt very welcome. Stephanie and her family helped wherever they could. Subway and bus stations are basically just around the corner and Harlem is definitely worth exploring.[QWERTY123]Terrific location and host. Super easy to get anywhere and very comfortable.[QWERTY123]Buen lugar[QWERTY123]We had a nice stay at this Airbnb. Very nice and friendly family. 
The only thing that disappointed me was that the room looked very different than the one that is shown in the internet, but all in all very nice .[QWERTY123]Felt like coming home.Thank you so much!!![QWERTY123]Misi’s place is very close to Central Park. You have access to the kitchen and share a bathroom with the other guests. I only saw the other guests like twice, but they were very nice. Mizi was really nice and gave us information about places to eat in the area, where we could do laundry, what subways and busses we can take, and where the nearest library was so my wife could do some homework on a desktop. She always kept the TP stocked up and provided a hair dryer. Her place is close to the Seinfeld restaurant (if your a Seinfeld fan), so we had Sunday brunch there (it was packed), but the food was reasonably priced. Our favorite place in Harlem was a small coffee shop called Monkey Cup. We went there because we thought it would be fun to have monkey faces on our coffee, but we were very impressed with the taste as well. Best coffee we had on the whole trip. Mizi also told us about the restaurant right across the street, we ate there on taco Tuesday. They were 3 bucks a piece. We ordered the fish, pork, and steak. They were all great.[QWERTY123]Mizi's place is GREAT! She and her family are very kind, they take care of very little details that make the difference. I arrived to her house and left her place in the middle of the night, both times, but she waited for me awake the first day, and she ensured I had an appointment with a taxi service on the day of departing. The neibourghood is beautiful, excellent location and pretty quiet at nights, but safe enough. I walked alone through its streets at late hours and I can guarantee that. The bedroom is even better that it's shown in the pictures, it's absolutely clean and cozy, and so is the bathroom. This is the perfect shelter for a stay in the Big Apple, regardless off the length of the trip.[QWERTY123]駅も近く非常に快適｡夜も比較的安全と言われ､夜12時ぐらいに帰ってもそんなに危険な感じはしなかった｡ただ周りにお店は少ないので､朝食をﾆｭｰﾖｰｸの素敵なお店で食べたい場合は最終日の飛行機を遅い時間するのがｵｽｽﾒ｡

Propre et bien équipé, vous profiterez de tous les conseils des hôtes pour découvrir NYC et Harlem.[QWERTY123]Großartige Lage, man ist praktisch in 5 Minuten bei 2 verschiedenen U-Bahn-Stationen und schläft nachts für Großstadtverhältnisse erstaunlich ruhig. Was zu erwähnen wäre ist höchstens noch dass sich die Wohnung im dritten Stock befindet, das Treppenhaus etwas eng ist und kein Fahrstuhl vorhanden ist. Das Bad teilt man sich eventuell mit anderen Gästen, also Pech falls jemand anders duscht und man dringend ins Bad muss. Ansonsten kann man sich wirklich nicht beschweren bei dem Preis. Die billigsten Hotels in NY sind doppelt so teuer.[QWERTY123]Meine Schwester und ich haben im März 2018 für 5 Tage bei Mizi und Ihrer Familie gewohnt.
Die Wohnung und unser Zimmer waren sehr schön eingerichtet und wir hatten genügend Platz um uns auch mal zwischen den Sightseeingtouren auszuruhen.
Das eigene Bad, welches wir uns mit dem anderen Paar teilten war sauber und schön. Mizi hat uns super herzlich empfangen und uns tolle Tipps rund um New York gegeben und uns Restaurants in der Umgebung empfohlen.
DI Lage ist mehr als perfekt, da man in 10 Minuten mit der U-Bahn am Times Square ist und auch die Gegend rund um das Appartement sehr schön und vorallem sicher ist.
Sollten wir wiede nach New York kommen würden wir definitiv noch einmal bei Mizi wohnen :)[QWERTY123]Close enough to public transport and within a 2 min walk to Central Park, Stephanie’s flat was everything we could have wished for.
Got a bit crowded in the one bathroom we were given to use (5 guests for 1 bathroom) but over all, we really enjoyed our stay and would definitely recommend Stephanie’s place to anyone willing to visit the City :)[QWERTY123]Nous avons passé 6 jours chez Stéphanie, qui nous a très bien accueilli ainsi que sa famille. Le logement est situé à 10 min de times squares, donc c'est très pratique et en plus juste en face de central park ! Séjour au top, nous recommandons ce logement.[QWERTY123]Our room was large and spacious. The bunk bed can easily be used for 3 People (upper one small and a large one). As it was so hot outside we enjoyed the aircon. There was a bathroom which we shared with other guests of the second room. Steph and her family were great. All very uncomplicated, and helpful with advises conc Manhattan. We would come back next time if we can.[QWERTY123]![QWERTY123]Steph’s place was really convenient due to it’s location. The room was clean and bigger than expected. The hosts were really nice and worried about any need we had. Overall a nice experience, definitely recommended.[QWERTY123]Steph was amazing, the location is the most convenient next to the metro station and she was very accommodating.[QWERTY123]La chambre est conforme aux photos.

I can certainly suggest it as viable alternative to regular hotel. Excellent cost performance. Very kind and helpful owners. Thais, thanks for arranging the taxi early morning to the airport. It was cheaper than regular one.[QWERTY123]I stayed with Tahis & Greg for 3 days and was very pleased with my stay.  1/2 a block to M46 bus which takes you to subway station to catch A train express into midtown.  Very clean and exactly as pictured.  I was worried at first about the area as i had never stayed there before but didnt have any problems even when returning late at nite.  Will stay with Tahis & Greg again.[QWERTY123]Love it here.  Will continue to return.[QWERTY123]great place
recommended!!![QWERTY123]NA[QWERTY123]The leaving room is big and nice, but my bedroom was small, which is okay because once I was getting home I went to bed right away.[QWERTY123]Nice place, 10min from the first subway station, and 20min from the center of Manhattan. It's clean and we can use the big kitchen. Very good price for this room! Recommended![QWERTY123]We really enjoyed our stay at cozysuite!
It's not in manhatten, but actually it's ok. There is a bus right on the corner of the apartement. So, it was only a 3min walk to the bus. The bus takes you right to the station and if you take the subway it takes you about 20min to get to times square. So it's not a big deal.
There is also a supermarket right next to the apartement and everything is clean.
You can use pots and dishes in the kitchen. It's everything there.
The owner was really nice. She help us to get a taxi and answered all our questions.
The only thing that was bad, was that the bed was actually a single bed. So, it was a bit hard to share it. But therfor it's super cheap and you don't have to share a bathroom with so many people like you would if you take a hostel.
So, I would totally recommend it!!![QWERTY123]Staying at the Cozysuite in September 2010 I found that Greg & Thais were affable hosts. Primarily you can't beat the Cozysuites for value. 
If you are on a tight budget go ahead and book you will not regret a thing! Checking out Brooklyn from here was an out of this world experience! The only thing is, great coffee in the mornings is at least 20 minutes away from waking up, so maybe bring your own to get yourself going. Best wishes, JASON C Sydney Australia.[QWERTY123]1.Not a welcoming neibourhood for white people.
2.No hot water.
3.Part of the deposit wasn't given back without any explanation.[QWERTY123]The place is value for money. Peaceful to stay and I felt pretty secure at the nightime too. For women area can still be little frightening. If about 45 minute-trip to Manhattan doesen't bother you, I can recommend this. Not maybe the best place for people visiting New York City for the first time. Housekeeping could have been little better, for example many times there was no toilet paper available and the fridge was quite dirty, both which I guess should been host's responsibility.[QWERTY123]This was a clean, safe place to stay however it had some draw backs.  The fees really add up.  For 2 people over 4 nights it ended up costing us $71/night, not the $52 advertised.  Also, the pictures show a room with really nice bedding and lots of pillows.  It's the same room, just minus all the pillows and cozy suede comforter.  Instead each bed has one plastic covered flat pillow, clean sheets and some old nubby felt-like blankets (there were other people's hairs stuck to the one I had).  Also, while we were there one night the heater was on to the point that we were sweating and the other 3 nights we really froze with no heat at all.  The living room and kitchen are nice, there are dishes and cooking amenities so you can save some money on not eating out.  The 10 minute walk from the A or C train was also not bad.[QWERTY123]Good host and good apartment!

The metro station isn't far, around 600meters!!

Everything ok!![QWERTY123]""CozySuite Sanctuary"" is a very good place ; the bedroom is clean, clear and nice, very quiet (a benediction after all the noise and bustle of Manhattan). Commons parts are also great, clean and large enough to be share with others tenants. Obviously, remember it's not a hostel so take your shower gel and all the little things you usually need in travel ;) Thais is nice and discreet and... In fact, there is nothing wrong.
If you have a low budget and are looking for a bed to sleep after a long day and a  safe neighbourhood with great restaurants and grocery stores, it's the perfect place. And NYC is so extraordinary !"	40.68538416529318	-73.9327087021106	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/15509	2	59.0	0.866667
2	15729	"When we had to stay in NYC an extra day during Memorial Day weekend and accommodations were hard to find, my son and I stayed for one night at David's ""Village Green"" apartment in Red Hook, Brooklyn.  David was out of town for the night but his girlfriend (who also lives in the apartment) handled everything efficiently, giving us the key to the apartment and directions to the subway/bus.  The private room was comfortable, on the first floor with windows overlooking the street.  It seemed like a quiet neighborhood.  Judging from the books on the bookshelves, David has an excellent and eclectic taste in literature!  The bathroom had a large, modern tiled shower that was enjoyable.  All of our living space was clean and well-maintained.  There is a kitchen downstairs but we never used it.  Also living in the apartment is a friendly cat who came to visit us.  The only issue we had with David's place is that it's not that convenient for activities in Manhattan.  The subway lines are several blocks away, and while there's a bus stop right at the corner, the bus only goes into downtown Brooklyn, from which you must take the subway to go into Manhattan.  However, once on the subway, you'll be in the city in a few stops.  For budget-minded travelers who have time and patience to deal with going a little bit out of the way, David's place is a great choice.[QWERTY123]David was really nice, the room was great.  No problems at all.[QWERTY123]Clean apartment. Nice guy.[QWERTY123]David & Julie were very helpful and welcoming hosts, they Mister Bitzer (their violently friendly cat) was a very welcome presence too.

Our plans mostly involved Manhattan, but we couldn't afford to stay there at such short notice (I was a bit lazy sorting it out). Nevertheless Red Hook is a charming and safe neighbourhood, and nice and quiet at night (which in a city that can be so exhausting is very important - on my previous trip to NYC 10 years ago, I stayed uptown Manhattan and came home more stressed than when I'd left due to 10 days of pretty much continual noise).
[QWERTY123]Very comfortable place to stay at. The host was a great, and was real cool with us. I enjoyed my time there, and recommend this place if you are looking to stay in the Brooklyn area.[QWERTY123]David and his girlfriend Julie were fantastic hosts and very responsive to all of our questions and needs. They even offered us use of their bikes, which I so appreciated, even though I was wearing a prohibitively long dress. I'd forgotten the compact size of New York abodes, but our room was clean and comfortable. The location of Village Green is like a 20-ish minute walk to the nearest station, but it's a great neighborhood to walk in (as evidenced by the young families and their baby strollers nonchalantly crossing highway overpasses). They live within walking distance to a park, a waterfront, and fun restaurants in Red Hook (Hope & Anchor being one of them and vegan-friendly).[QWERTY123]Not great to be honest, wouldnt recommend staying here. Long walk to the subway, had to put sheets on the bed ourselves late at night, and had to ask for a glass of water.[QWERTY123]Nous avons passé 8 jours à new york dans l'appartement de David à East village. C'était une expérience inoubliable. L'appartement est très confortable, la boîte de nuit en dessous ne nous a absolument pas dérangé. La situation de l'appartement était idéale, à moins de 5 minutes du métro, à 10 minutes de Soho, de east village...David nous a très bien accueilli. Nous recommandons vivement ses services. Merci David[QWERTY123]Dave was a great guy...super friendly and willing to share his home. Village Green is in a cool part of Brooklyn with some good eats right around the corner...including some great Stumptown Coffee.

I'd stay there again![QWERTY123]If what you need is an easy place to hang your hat without a lot of hassle or structure to your stay, this is it. The other dwellers' noise could be a deterrent if you turn in earlier that young people.[QWERTY123]We were 4, and we stayed in Red Hook. 
David is someone very nice, well educated, cultivated, funny and interesting.
His english is very easy to understand, he gave us advices and good informations for visiting NYC. We spoke a lot with him. He showed us great places and we have been to a restaurant whith him. 
The district is safe but in the night there is nobody in the district. 
You must like animals, there is one dog and two cats. Don't be afraid of them they are very nice and they need affection. Maybe too much lol.
The house was clean. Don't look everything in details. 
Thank you David.[QWERTY123]Big David was GREAT. Very friendly we eve took him for lunch. Loved the dog and cats. Nice room,comfy bed.Glad we had the air conditioner in the room. Next time we visit we will use him fro sure,thanks AAAA++++
Donna&Stu[QWERTY123]David's place was great. Transport is a short walk away. In a quiet, safe neighborhood. Room has aircon for the NY summers & the beds nice & comfy. Cool little Bars & Eateries just around the area.
David was great, really helpful & pointed out the must do's of NYC. Strongly recommend his place as the Red Hook neighborhood is a hidden gem within Brooklyn

Cheers Mate,
Adam[QWERTY123]David is a nice person, which is more than you can say about the small room he rents out. It had a bed, yes, but it looked more like a storage room in a second hand furniture shop than a bedroom you would ask money for. It was, to be honest, quite a mess, and not very cosy. We had rented the room for three persons, but were happy that David let the third person put his mattress in the basement room. Once you figure out the bus system, it is pretty simple to go to Manhattan via bus and subway. But in conclusion, we have for a similar price rented far more attractive and better situated places in Brooklyn.[QWERTY123]David and Juli were lovely hosts, and made our stay easy and comfortable. Unfortunately, the place didn't look remotely like the pictures, and was not spic and span. We were primarily there to sleep, so we didn't mind terribly. The apartment is located perfectly in Red Hook, and we were able to walk and explore a good amount within 5 minutes of their place.[QWERTY123]My stay at Village Green worked out very well. I had business in the area so it was extra convenient, but its not a bad walk to the subway to Manhattan if you want to go there. David is a very pleasant fellow and I felt welcome and comfortable right away. I would recommend this airbnb to any one or two people visiting NYC.[QWERTY123]A place to avoid. Not sure the linens were clean; they didn't smell, but they didn't look fresh. Cheap flimsy pillows. Grotty shower floor with moldy curtain. Towel draped over the bed railing. Not sure if it was clean either. It felt like being ripped off. Clearly no effort whatever to make the place inviting. Like someone knew they were going away for a weekend, and decided to make a few bucks by letting someone sleep in their bed; they threw a spare towel on the bed and took off leaving the rest to AirBnB. I looked around for clean linens and would have put them on myself, but couldn't find any.

I was invited to use the kitchen, but I opened the refrigerator and it looked like a horror show from a cut rate fraternity house.

I understand that David has more than one place. Though I haven't seen the others, I wouldn't chance it.[QWERTY123]Place was available last minute. Room and bath were clean but cluttered. Not in a bad way, just lived in. Dog was very sweet too.[QWERTY123]There was nearby parking which is a huge plus. The host wasn't very friendly but quick and to the point. Set up in apartment is unusual. It was moderately clean, I was able to use the washer and dryer which is a good thing because I had to wash my sheets before I was able to actually sleep in them. I didn't really appreciate the used band-aid I found in between the sheets ( especially since I asked for a honest genuine response as to when the sheets were last cleaned). Not cool at all.[QWERTY123]This is a great apartment in a really great neighborhood. David was incredibly flexible about check-in time and made the trip super easy. Parking in the neighborhood was a breeze. The bed was comfortable.[QWERTY123]The reservation was canceled 3 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.[QWERTY123]Great place! Very quaint."	40.67694747831807	-74.01120866313687	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/15729	4	89.0	0.966667

Highly recommend all round,( at the risk of it not being available next time )[QWERTY123]We (7 people from the Netherlands) are just returned from seven days New York. We stayed in appartment 2.

Groeten van familie Velsing,

[QWERTY123]We had a great stay in Dimitri's apartment.  Some of the older guests in our party were visiting the US for the first time so it was important to us that they enjoyed New York and the accommodation offered.

The 5 of us had plenty of space to relax after long shopping days in NYC. All the rooms were clean and inviting.  It was great to have a large living room and a kitchen too.

Dimitri is a great host and was so helpful to us before and during our stay.  It was a great comfort to know that he was living so close by and we felt very secure.  We were made to feel very welcome and our stay in the apartment made the trip a success.

This is a perfect place to stay in New York - a quiet, friendly Brooklyn neighbourhood that is close to some nice restaurants and bars. A subway station is a few blocks away.  

Thank you Dimitri! We will definitely be recommending this apartment to friends.[QWERTY123]Dimitri's apartment was perfect for our party of eight!  Clean and comfortable with a fully stocked kitchen (minus the food). Conveniently located near subway stops, restaurants, markets, bars and the beautiful Prospect Park.  Dimitri was a fabulous host with lots of information about the neighborhood.  A great playground is right across the street for families with young kids that need to get out and move![QWERTY123]
We were a little apprehensive about the accomodation prior to the visit as it is our first time but we need not have been worried! apartment! We stayed at Dimitris for 3 days while we were visiting sights in New York. The Apartment was clean spacious and in good repair - we had no issues with the Apartment what so ever! Dimitri,  we could not have asked for a better host !He was always cheerful , helpful, made us very welcome and  available if we had questions to be raised! There is no doubt in our minds that when we go back we will be booking with Dimitri through Air B&B
We all send our best wishes Dimitri![QWERTY123]Nous étions 9 et l'appartement nous a permis de passer un excellent séjour, confortable. Dimitri et Nikolai sont très sympathiques et nous ont bien accueillis. L'appartement est bien situé calme et proche de plusieurs lignes de métro desservant manahattan.
Nous tenons aussi à remercier le support de airbnb qui nous a aidé suite à l'anulation du premier appartement que nous avions loué : il nous a trouvé cet appartement et a fait toutes les démarches.[QWERTY123]Great welcome by the owner, a file with all kinds of info. to make life easy, everything from transport to restaurants spacious bedrooms, loads of hot water and comfortable beds.  We all (5of us) were extremely happy - so much so that after trekking around NY for hours and hours, we were delighted to get back 'home'.  Many thanks - a great address and is being passed on to others as we speak..

Lynda and Eric Rolin - Belgium[QWERTY123]Great apartment in a nice neighbourhood and manhattan is very easy to reach from here. Dimitri was very helpful and easy to deal with. We really enjoeyd our stay and recommend this apartment to groups up to 8 people (as we were).[QWERTY123]We had a perfect trip to Dimitri's home in Brooklyn, the apartment was perfect.  Very clean and in a great area, I was very surprised how big the apartment was especially for NY and  I was also so happy that I found parking every day right across the street from the apartment. That's rare in New York!  
One day we had to move the car for street cleaning and Dimitri was kind enough to move the car so we didn't have to wake up too early!!  I will definitely be back and hope I can stay here when we come to NY!!  Big thank you Dimitti Everything was Perfect!! (June 2012)[QWERTY123]Just got back from our stay at 117 Underhill Ave. It was the perfect accommodation for us. We were 6, but never did the space feel crowded. Bedrooms are all good sizes and the flat itself was pretty big overall, especially compared to most NY and Brooklyn apartments. The location was ace; perfectly positioned within Prospect Heights, a short walking distance to Prospect Park, Fort Greene, and an easy subway ride to Williamsburg and  Manhattan. Would definitely stay there again. Thanks to Dimitri and his family who were all super laid-back and very accommodating. We had the best time![QWERTY123]Nous avons logé chez Dimitri début juillet 2012.  L'appartement était très spacieux et confortable.  Dimitri et son frère sont des hôtes super.  Nous avons adoré notre séjour![QWERTY123]Our stay at Dimitri's apartment could not have been more pleasant and successful. The host was exceptionally friendly and helpful, and added tremendously to the overall quality of our stay. We will gladly stay there again in the future, and strongly recommend Dimitri and his apartment to anyone who may be coming through New York City.[QWERTY123]Dimitri's apartment was just great and Dimitri himself was a wonderful host. The apartment was very clean and it was big enough for two families (4 adults, 4 teens + 1 baby). It was close to two subway stations with direct access to Manhattan. 
On the day we left, we were allowed to keep our luggage in the apartment until 6 PM - although Dimitri had other quests arriving the same night - and he even called cabs for us to take us to the airport!
Without hesitation, we can most warmly recommend the apartment to anyone! Thanks again, Dimitri![QWERTY123]Dimitri's apartment is spacious, clean and convenient for groups with 6-8 people. Dimitri himself is a warm and helpful gentleman host. He gave us detailed instruction for traffic and sightseeing, also reminded me to move our car from the street cleaning side.
If you are about to visit NY and still want to stay away from noise and squeeze of the big city, this is definitely your choice.[QWERTY123]We had a fabulous time staying at this apartment.  Dimitri greeted us and explained all about the area and the apartment.  We had enough room for 4 adults and 4 children.  Dimitri and his family were very quiet and so were the family in the apartment below us.  Everything you needed was supplied.  
There wasn't a laundry but a short walk away there was one that you could drop off you washing and pick it up later in the day for a minimal cost.  
Many fantastic restaurants, especially the little Italian one we found down the road, ask Dimitri for the name.
Next door is a small store that you can buy emergency items and a block away is a supermarket.
Subway stations are close by and Dimitri supplies you with a map of the area.
For families with young children there is a playground across the road.
Overall we had a fantastic time in New York and the accommodation was something to rave about.
[QWERTY123]We were 3 couples from oz and enjoyed our 13days  in this (Website hidden by Airbnb) a newish four bedroom apartment close to all ny transport. Walk to three stations in under 10 minutes for trains to manhattan downtown.
Reasonable rates, very clean, in a quiet neighborhood . 
For art lovers, Judy Chicago's famous ""dinner party "" artwork is permanently housed in the Brooklyn museum of art, less than a ten minute walk up the (Website hidden by Airbnb) a park that is better than central park, manhattan.....and that's just the (Website hidden by Airbnb) is an astounding museum..and the library you pass on the way is just spectacular.
Good food and coffee is nearby, and it's good to stay in a community, not a hotel.
Am recommending this as a great place for families.or (Website hidden by Airbnb) is a good deal.
[QWERTY123]Thanks to Dimitri and his family. We had great pleasure to meet them and to stay in Brooklyn for a week
A very nice place, to be truly recommended indeed! Apartment is very comfortable and quiet. All commodities are near and very easy to find (shops, restaurants, subway, buses, parks…).

[QWERTY123]The apartment was spacious, light-filled, very clean, with modern furniture and attractive window and bedding treatments. 

We arrived having driven from WI to find our host, Dimitri, ready and willing to help us haul everything from our car. He showed us each room of the apartment, noting particular aspects, explained the dishwasher procedure and the thermostat, showed us where extra supplies were. He was always open to our questions and was clear in his explanations. He is a gracious and humorous man with much musical talent. 

We had come to Brooklyn for our daughter's wedding and were very pleased that five of us had plenty of room in the apartment. I was also pleased that there was an ironing board and an iron. Art work painted by Dimitri's mother graced the walls and was beautiful.

The apartment is conveniently located near a small grocery store,  of which we took advantage several times.

Parking was not as difficult as we had anticipated. We always found a spot quite close to the apartment. There are also three car park garages in the nearby area.

Because of Hurricane Sandy, we left a day early to beat the storm home. Again, Dimitri helped us reload the car, this time with with my other daughters' and another son-in-law's luggage. Their flights had been cancelled. Dimitri gave us good advice and directions to get out of the area safely.

We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would highly recommend this apartment and our host, Dimitri Moderbacher![QWERTY123]My husband and I booked Demitri's apartment for a wedding in Brooklyn.  We were meeting 2 other couples who were coming from other cities with different arrival times.  Demitri was more than accomodating to the various arrival times.  The apartment was in a great location - just minutes from a subway station and amazing restaurants.  It was very clean and we had everything we needed.  I would highly recommend staying here![QWERTY123]Nous y sommes allé pendant les fêtes de Noel. 
Cet appartement tient ces promesses : grand, spacieux, idéal jusqu’à 8 personnes. Facile d'accès pour Manhattan (3 métros à proximité, dont le C, très rapide). Dans un quartier très sympa & typique. Tous commerces à coté. Mais surtout AU CALME! (Et c'est bien agréable de pouvoir dormir tranquillement,après les longues journées à visiter NY! ). Le seul petit bémol : les lits des 2 petites chambres sont assez dur.
En plus Dimitri et sa famille sont adorables : plein de bons conseils, avant & pendant le séjour.
Je conseil à toute personne recherchant un grand appartement,pour dormir au calme et facile d'accès pour visiter![QWERTY123]A wonderful 2 week stay in a proper Brooklyn apartments. The house itself was perfectly suited for our needs - located in a great area, very close amenities, warm and inviting. Dimitri was a perfect host and we couldn't ask for anything more. If you're looking for a great NY experience, this apartment is exactly what you need.
[QWERTY123]10 días inolvidables en NY. Nos hospedamos 7 personas. Apartamento muy limpio, amplio, cómodo y bien comunicado con el metro. Dimitri es una persona muy amable y colaboradora, nos ayudo en todas las peticiones que hicimos e hizo nuestra estancia muy agradable. Totalmente recomendable el hospedarse en este apartamento, en un barrio muy tranquilo y seguro tanto de día como de noche. Mis amigos y yo quedamos encantados y tenemos claro que volveremos a NY y volveremos a este apartamento!![QWERTY123]Beside the fact that I would recommend this appartment to everyone (I'm actually already recommended it to my closest friends) there's not much to add really. Dimitri is a great host, helpful, kind, reachable at any time. The appt fits for everybody, wether you're with babies (like we were) or just a bunch of friends, it's just great! The neigbourhood is super! Everything you need is at walking distance. There's not one bad thing we can think of regarding our experience here. If we're going back one day, we know our place to stay![QWERTY123]Great apartment in Brooklyn! I thoroughly recommend it and Dimitri was a great host![QWERTY123]Dimitri was awesome to work with, the apartment was great, and the area was perfect. We went to Brooklyn for a week to visit with family and stayed in the apartment with our 4 year old and 2 year old. The apartment itself was great, it's better then the pictures . The area itself is surrounded with brownstones and playgrounds. We used the playground across the street, walked to prospect park, visited the zoo.. it was fantastic.

We had a car and finding parking in the area was actually really simple, I was worried I would need to park a mile away but each time I easily found street parking within a block of the apartment.

The area is filled with restaurants, coffee shops, and grocery stores within a few blocks. 

If we go back to Brooklyn , we will absolutely stay at the apartment again.. it was just perfect for our family.[QWERTY123]Really nice and clean flat. Household appliances easy to use and modern. With 4 real bedrooms allowing to accommodate 8 people with comfort. The neighborhood is really nice and quiet, next to Prospect park. Dimitri is very nice, welcoming and always ready to help.[QWERTY123]Nous avons passé 10 jours à 8 (3 adultes + 5 enfants) chez Dimitri, et ce fut parfait. L'appartement est très agréable, spacieux, silencieux (rare à NY), équipé avec tout ce qu'il faut, idéalement situé (magasins, parc et 3 lignes de metro directs pour Manhattan). En outre, Dimitri est un hôte très attentionné. C'est un bon plan !!!!![QWERTY123]Dimitri was a very nice host. The flat is very nice and clean. It was really nice to come back to brooklyn and to find peace and quite in that nice area after all the excitement but also the noise of Manhattan.
I will definately recommend this flat to anyone. It is very spacious. The area is very nice with parks, a baggel shop, a supermarket, a whine shop and a deli just around the corner. We very easily felt like home.[QWERTY123]Staying with Dimitri was really great! He and his bother live in the same house, that is why they are always ready to help you if a problem occurs. The apartment provides you with everything you need and is comfortable for up to 6 persons, one room has no windows which might not suit everyone. The two bedrooms facing the yard are very quiet and in the morning the cackling hens may wake you up. It was my second time in New York and I loved staying in Brooklyn in contrast to Manhattan.
A big plus for German speaking guests: Dimitri is Austrian and speaks the language perfectly![QWERTY123]We had a very nice stay in Dimitri's great apartment.
The apartment was exactly as described, with four separated bedrooms and a large living room, nice kitchen, two bathrooms.
The apartment was perfectly clean, with everything needed. Really feel like home !
The neighborhood was nice and quiet, 5-10 min walk from de closest subway station, with restaurants, bars, supermarket.
Dimitri was very nice and gentle, giving good advices, booking our taxi to go back to the airport.
I would definitly recommend his apartment, me and my family really enjoyed our stay here.[QWERTY123]2 words...  BEYOND EXPECTATIONS!  We are a family/friends group from Perth, Western Australia comprising of 8 people. Our 8 day stay in Brooklyn at Dimitri's apartment was wonderful.  So many reasons why....we wanted for nothing...all amenities were there as well as a host who was friendly, fun and always willing to assist. Great location, easy to get around and many restaurants, supermarkets, laundry's etc. just around the corner. We had a wonderful stay and can't recommend it highly enough.  All of us would be back in a (Website hidden by Airbnb) Power ball! Thanks Dimitri & family...see you again one day, we hope, if not, there's always a very long flight to where we are!  xx[QWERTY123]L'appartement de Dimitri est tel qu'il est décrit dans l'annonce ! Nous sommes partis à 7 (5 adultes et 2 enfants) et nous ne nous sommes pas sentis à l'étroit , la taille des chambres est correcte. La cuisine est complète et très fonctionnelle. L'appartement est bien entretenu et propre.
Le quartier est agréable et idéal pour se reposer après avoir passé la journée dans la foule et le bruit de Manhattan . Le métro est à 10 min à pied.

Dimitri est un hôte attentionné et très serviable.
Je recommande cet appartement et y retournerais volontiers si l'occasion se présentait.[QWERTY123]I've recently returned from New York having hired Dimitri's apartment for 7 nights in a group of 8. To cut to the chase, the apartment is fantastic and Dimitri nothing short of a true gent. 

We were in the city for a wedding but also had plenty of time to see some sights and do some socialising, with easy access to the subway stations at Grand Army Plaza and 7th it's easy to get to most places without fuss. Locally, the bagels and burritos available on Vanderbilt, one street across, are first class. Nice short walks through sleepy brownstone streets take you to 5th where you can experience the myriad pleasures of Park Slope and beyond. Also, really quick to Coney Island, which was a bonus. 

The apartment is spacious, clean, with good facilities and a friendly face if you need any help with anything, I can't recommend heartily enough. Get away fro the hubbub of Manhattan and come stay here! Thanks again from the 8 of us.[QWERTY123]I’d like to start by saying that Dimitri was a terrific host.  He was a great communicator, answered all our questions in a timely manner and was very thorough in his responses.   He went above and beyond by sending us directions to give to our taxi driver from both JFK and LaGuardia.  He was also kind enough to let us check in early and to check out a bit later as all of us had different departure times.  NICE!  The apartment was great!  We were in town for my daughter’s wedding and we had PEOPLE.  Wound up maxing out the apartment with 8 people and it worked out great.  The apartment was very nice, 2nd floor with Dimitri above us on the 3rd floor and I believe his brother on the first floor.  The apartment was quiet, the bathrooms were nice and clean with lots of linens and there was plenty of hot water too.  The kitchen was well supplied (yup, a dishwasher) and clean.  Pretty much everything you needed.  Location wise, it was perfect.  Go out the front door and immediately to the left was a corner shop.  Need milk, done.  A toothbrush, done.  A sandwich, done.  Etc. Etc. Two blocks away there was a bagel shop.  Fresh bagels, yumm.  There was a market there also and a breakfast sandwich shop too.  Subway was about two blocks away.  I didn’t use the subway but my sons did and they said it was easy peasy.  If you have young children there is a playground right across the street from the apartment.   Dimitri also gave us the number of a car service (Evelyn) and that worked out super.  My transportation recommendation….leave the car at home and use the subway and car service.  Yes, the car service is a bit expensive but there is the subway too.  I think there was a parking garage on the same street but didn’t really look into it.  Street parking was between slim and none and I think it may be restricted to residents with tags.  Guess you’d have to ask Dimitri about that.  I would and will recommend Dimitri to anyone visiting NYC/Brooklyn area and especially if you have a big crew with you.  Thanks Dimitri![QWERTY123]Dimitri Moderbacher is an excellent host.  Our flight arrived at 11:20 PM and Dimitri's  greeting was so welcoming and warm, he provided us with lots of information about neighborhood as well as transportation. The apartment is well kept and very roomy, you will not be disappointed.  I promise you will love it. 
Easy access to subways and public buses (20 min ride to Manhattan).  Very cute upcoming neighborhood with great food, local bars and parks if you are traveling with kids.   
I would book again in a heart beat.[QWERTY123]Dimitri our host is very kind, helpful, friendly and comprehensive in our arrival and departure time. The apartment is ideally located 10 minutes from subway station, in a very quiet and pleasant neighborhood. Large, clean, quiet, well equipped, it was a pleasure to rest there after our everyday trip in Manhattan. Only 20mn to Manhattan by Q line, we will certainly come back here during our next journey to NYC. Thank's for all Dimitri.[QWERTY123]Very nice, quiet, clean, apartment. It is near shops and subway. Dimitri is very friendly and helpful. A place to recommend. If we go back to NYC, we will go back there.[QWERTY123]Dimitri was a great host. Everything was perfectly organized and provided in advance: how to get from the JFK airport to his

house, a very detailed description of the apartment in a beautiful Brooklyn neighbourhood including

pictures, the direction from the subway to Manhattan, recommendations for restaurants, jazz clubs....

The apartment was very spacious and well equipped, clean, quiet and light – just perfect for our one week stay in NY!

We felt very comfortable and we can highly recommend this place.

Uta and Dirk[QWERTY123]Lägenheten var rymlig och fräsch. Dimitri var en jättetrevlig värd. Han var väldigt hjälpsam. En av oss skulle springa maraton så han hjälpte oss med transport och tips kring detta. När vi skulle åka hem kunde vi lämna väskorna efter att vi checkat ut för att hämta dom senare på dagen. Området är lugnt och trevlig, närmsta tunnelbana är 2 kvarter bort. Det tog ca 20 min in till Manhattan.[QWERTY123]Dimitri was extremely easy to work with and very concerned with ensuring our colleagues had a great experience.  He checked in before and during the trip to make sure everything was going well.  It definitely did.

If we ever needed similar accommodations, we'd definitely stay with Dimitri again.[QWERTY123]We are a large family of 8 ( 6 kids) and we spent 1 week to Dimitri apartment during Christmas break.
We definitively enjoyed staying in such a location; first of all, Dimitri is a warm host; he gave us a lot of information and advice before our arrival and welcome us to ensure we will be ""at home"" in his apartment. Dimitri propose some sleeping arrangements to make our trip more confortable. The apartment was very clean and  was as described, functional & comfortable and very quiet!
The location in Brooklyn is nice as in the mean time  we were  less than 10' by walk to the subway station for Manhattan and there are a lot to do/visit in Brooklyn aswell . All the shops for daily needs are at one block from the flat (5' by walk).
We definitively recommend this apartment and his host!
Thank you again Dimitri!
Jean 
[QWERTY123]We were 6 people and we spent 9 days in Dimitri's apartment for New year's eve. The location is good in a quiet area, near a subway station.(10 minutes walking)
The apartment is exactly as described, very comfortable, large, clean and well furnished.
Dimitri is a great host. He helped us by printing some tickets for shows booked by internet, and by booking the taxis at the end of the stay.
We highly recommend this place and we will return with great pleasure
Thank you Dimitri[QWERTY123]Everything was exactly what we expected. Beautiful apartment, in a very nice and quiet neighborhood. Just a 10 mn walk to the subway stations for Manhattan (that's important when you just have a week) and all convenience  like supermarket and restaurants. And Dimitri is really welcoming and a helpful host. We all warmly recommend this apartment. It make our week in New York unforgettable.[QWERTY123]We had a great stay at Dimitri's. Our group of seven easily fit in his nice, clean and fully equipped appartement, everything was exactly as described. Great location, quiet and pleasant, close from the subway, easy ride to Manhattan, Park Slope, BK downtown... Dimitri was a great host and everything was very well organized. Our special recommandation : pancakes at Tom's, just around the block,b/t Sterling Pl & Lincoln Pl ![QWERTY123]Leuk appartement, alles aanwezig wat je nodig hebt. Heel vriendelijke eigenaar, zeer behulpzaam.Het appartement is gelegen in een rustige buurt en Manhatten is vlot bereikbaar met de metro..[QWERTY123]We were with 8 adults, the apartment is great! Very clean, a lot of space. It is well equiped and the beds are very good. The place is nice and safe! Very near to the metro, all the interesting places can be reached in a short time. There are a lot of shops and restaurants in the neighbourhood. Dimitri is a very good host, a very nice and helpfull person. We got a lot of information about where to go and how to reach everything. If we go back to New York we definitely will stay there again.

Maria and Vella Narayen, Holland
[QWERTY123]We were a family with 7 adults and the apartment is perfect! It is very clean and a lot of space. There is a comfortable kitchen with a lot of dishes. It is well furnished and the beds are very good. The flat is very near located to the metro, all the interesting places can be reached in a short time. There are a lot of shops and restaurants in the neighborhood. Dimitri is a very good host, a very nice and helpfull person who speaks german as well. We got a lot of information about where to go and how to reach everything. If we go back to New York we definitely will stay there again.[QWERTY123]Apartamento muy confortable, limpio, amplio, perfectamente equipado y situado en una zona tranquila, segura  y bien comunicada por metro. El salón y tres de los dormitorios son exteriores con muy buen aislamiento.
Dimitri es muy agradable y adicionalmente a la información que nos proporcionó a la llegada (transportes, restaurantes, eventos...) nos facilitó la partida (tarjetas de embarque, taxi al aeropuerto).
En resumen un muy buen sitio para pasar unos dia/semanas en NY y un estupendo anfitrión que te orienta y facilita las cosas.
[QWERTY123]Un grand merci à  Dimitri  qui a été un hôte très serviable et plein de bon conseils. L'appartement était spacieux, nous étions 8 la première moitié du séjour et 6 l'autre moitié. Très propre et très bien équipé il ne manquait rien, on s'est senti comme à la maison, l'endroit idéal pour se relaxer après des journées à arpenter les rues de new york. 

Le quartier est sympa avec des commerces, bars, restaurants à proximité. Le métro est à 10 minutes à pied dans des rue  arborées et bordées de jolies petites maisons.  

On recommande cet appartement et y retournerons avec plaisir.[QWERTY123]We had a wonderful time staying at this apartment. Dimitri is an amazing, attentive host - he is so friendly and welcoming, and provides an abundance of helpful information; we felt safe and cared for, knowing he was nearby and only a text away with answers! The apartment itself is in pristine condition. The rooms are spotless and updated and everything is in great working order. We felt perfectly comfortable walking around in our bare feet because it was so clean :). We had five adults in the apartment, and there was plenty of room. The living room is very comfortable, with plenty of room to relax and watch the World Cup, and the dining area seats 6 - quite rare in a NYC apartment! The two back bedrooms are spacious and well appointed. The front bedroom is smaller, but still had plenty of room for our clothes. The fourth bedroom would be best in cooler weather, because it is the only room without an air conditioner (no window, so not possible); it does have two fans, so Dimitri has made sure this littler room is as comfortable as possible anyway. The bathrooms are in perfect condition and the water pressure is great. The kitchen is modern and has everything you might need.
It is a lovely, tree-lined, quiet, safe neighborhood, with a little grocery next door. There are many restaurants and groceries, etc. within a few blocks, and there are several subway lines within a few blocks as well. It takes only about 20 minutes to get into Manhattan from these lines, so it is a great choice with a great host and a lot of comfortable space at a much better price than staying in Manhattan.[QWERTY123]We were 8 people, 2 families of 4, and had a great time in Dimitri's house. The apartment is very spacious and nice, well equipped and clean. The neihborough is perfect for tourists who want to taste the flavor of local life, and close to subway and supermarkets.
Dimitri was extremely kind and and friendly. I definitely advice this place to big families or groups of two families.[QWERTY123]Dimitri's apartment was perfect for our stay in New York as a family of four. It was roughly half an hour's taxi ride from JFK, and when we arrived we were met by our host and given a few pointers on where the local subway was (there were two stations nearby both of which took you into central Manhattan) and where the local shops were (The Olde Bagel shop was a particular favourite of ours, but there were numerous places to eat out or buy food to bring back within a short walk.) The area itself was very quiet which was perfect once you have spent a long day walking round sight seeing on the main island, but also had good connections to the south of Brooklyn, which meant that Coney Island beach was also easily accessible for a quieter day relaxing on the beach. 
The apartment was exactly as described with four bedrooms, two bathrooms, a fully equipped kitchen and a living room with a seperate dining area to eat. Dimitri lives in the apartment upstairs so is always available if you need him - we found him to be an excellent host, and would absolutely stay here again.[QWERTY123]Great trip! Dimitri is a wonderful host, very welcoming, easy to talk to and organised.
The apartment is as it's said. Spacious, modern and clean.
The neighborhood is like Brooklyn is: a melting-pot with an open spirit. It's safe with good access to the subway. You can find café, restaurants, bars one bloc from the apartment.
If I plane a new trip to NYC I would contact Dimitri with no hesitation.

Thank you again Dimitri for this great week!


Superbe séjour! Dimitri est un hôte adorable et très accueillant. Il est disponible et bien organisé.
L'appartement correspond parfaitement à la description, les chambres sont spacieuses, l'ensemble très lumineux et surtout moderne et bien entretenu.
Le quartier correspond à l'esprit de Brooklyn: un melting-pot à l'esprit ouvert. C'est un quartier tranquille, bien desservi par le métro. Il y a des petits commerces, café, bar, restaurants à un bloc de l'appartement.
Si je devais revenir à NYC, je recontacterai Dimitri sans hésiter.
Je vous le conseil vivement![QWERTY123]Dimitri is a very nice guy and host. Me and the group had a very good week in the appartment. It's a nice neighborhood and the 'Deli' downstairs is fantastic![QWERTY123]An excellent apartment in a nice neighborhood of Brooklyn. Close to a few subway stations that will bring you quickly to Manhattan and other interesting places. Dimitri is a fantastic and sympathetic host who gives you a lot of helpful information. We were with a group of six friends and we all enjoyed our stay at Dimitri's apartment. You have our recommendation. (we think that musicians are better hosts ;-)[QWERTY123]We really loved this apartment. It was immaculate, spacious (we were a group of 6 people) and had everything and more than we needed. It actually looks better than on the photos. Dimitri is a great host and is available to answer any questions. We were there to go sightseeing in NYC and it was convenient to use the metro and come back at night to a quiet and nice neighborhood with lots of possibilities to eat out. But the apartment has a fully equipped kitchen there too.
[QWERTY123]There was a group of 7 of us staying at Dimitri's place and we couldn't be happier with our experience.  The place is a great space and had enough room for all of us and our luggage for the week.  The pictures are completely accurate, and the place is spotless!  We all arrived at various times and Dimitri was there to welcome the first group (which included myself and two others) as soon as we arrived.  After dealing with a taxi driver, that took me for a nice long ride around the city, he showed us around the apartment and ran through all the details to make our stay comfortable.  Once all of us arrived Dimitri did check in with us to make sure everything was all good.  There is ""the binder"" that has maps to places around Brooklyn for seeing and eating.  It also shows where all the subway stations are near the apartment (there are three of them all within a 5 minute walk).  Getting into the city is quick and with three stations so close you are always able to find a way back at the end of the night.

The neighbourhood is so quiet at all times of day, so if you're out all night there won't be much noise to wake you up early in the day.  There are tons of restaurants within walking distance and can cater towards any cravings you might have.  There are also a few delis and grocery stores within walking distance to grab supplies to make your own meals.

If we ever make it back to NYC we will definitely be checking to see if we can get back in to Dimitri's place as it was a great value for money and the perfect place to stay for a holiday.[QWERTY123]Logement fidèle à la description. Nous étions 4 adultes et 4 enfants, l'appartement était assez grand pour tout le monde. Super bien situé près de deux lignes de métro. Quartier sympa avec plusieurs restaurants .
Dimitri est très acceuillant, donne plein d'informations sur le quartier et sur New York. Il est présent au besoin pour répondre aux questions. Je recommande cet appartement et Dimitri pour tout séjour à New York et y retournerai sans hésitation[QWERTY123]We waren een familie met 6 personen en hebben een geweldige tijd gehad. Het appartement was voor ons perfect en was net als op de foto's. Zeer ruim en schoon. In de buurt voldoende keus aan supermarkten en restaurants. Op loopafstand van verschillende metro stations. Dimitri is zeer attent en behulpzaam. We kunnen het iedereen aanraden.[QWERTY123]Dimitri was very welcoming, and is a great communicator! He met us as we arrived and answered our everyday questions by text. He helped us to call a car service to take us back to the airport, so that went very smoothly. The apartment is very well laid out, bathrooms and the kitchen were recently renovated. The street is fairly quiet, and the building is very safe.  Metro stops are less than 10 min walk. We had 5 people in the party, and there was plenty of room. We would stay there again! Highly recommended.[QWERTY123]Adorei o apartamento e o bairro. Por sugestão do anfitrião, passamos o 31 no parque próximo e vimos a queima de fogos e show de música. Foi excelente. 
Várias linhas de metrô ficam a poucas quadras.
Dimitri é muito simpático e tem todas as dicas para melhor aproveitarmos o tempo.[QWERTY123](English & French version)

Dimitri is the perfect host! He was always available for us during and before this week, he gave us a lot of great places for brunch, dinner, supermarkets and other activities. In top of that, in the apartment there are a lot of documentation about the neighbourhood and Dimitri gave for each of us a paper with subway's information. 
The apartment is really nice, clean and quiet. It's perfect for 7 persons. Also, we enjoyed Brooklyn with a lot of restaurants and cultural activities. It is really easy to go from Brooklyn to Manhattan.
We adviced you this very good address for unforgettable holidays!

Dimitri est l’hôte parfait!  Il a toujours été très disponible avant notre séjour et pendant notre séjour, il nous a donné de bonnes adresses pour le brunch, le dîner, les super marchés et les autres activités. En plus de cela, il y a beaucoup de documentations sur le quartier dans l'appartement et Dimitri nous a donné à chacun une feuille avec les directions du métro.
L'appartement est très joli, propre et calme. C'est parfait pour 7 personnes. Nous avons apprécié le quartier de Brooklyn avec ses restaurants et ses activités culturelles. C'est très facile de se déplacer de Brooklyn à Manhattan. Nous vous recommandons cette très bonne adresse pour passer des vacances inoubliables!

[QWERTY123]Dimitri is a great host. He is very welcoming and reactive. The apartment is perfect for a group of 7 people and we feel like home there! The neighborhood is also very calm and friendly with great shops and restaurants nearby and easy access to public transports. I warmly recommend the place.[QWERTY123]This is a great airbnb apartment.  If you get the chance -stay here.
We have stayed in a number of airbnb apartments in Brooklyn now and this stands out as the best.  You can't tell it from the photos but it is by far the most comfortable and was to live with. 

The things that make this place great are all things you might take for granted but many of the alternatives do not have them.  They are:

1. a thermostat
2. rugs - making the place cosier and quieter
3. a fully equipped kitchen - including dishwasher, and all the little things that make cooking easy.
4. It is set up for short term lets with maps / guides / menus galore.

Dimitri was a great host - friendly and accessible.  We left a couple of bits behind and Dimitri made sure they were returned to us.

This is a great neighbourhood.   We had small children with us and there is the most amazing playground I've ever seen right across the road.  It is packed with donated push along toys / water tables / plastic kitchens and has equipment for younger and older children - so much fun.  It's also near the museum, library, gardens and B/Q lines which are fast (relatively).[QWERTY123]L'accoglienza al nostro arrivo da parte del nostro host e' stata molto cordiale con dettagliate informazioni sulla casa e i dintorni. L'appartamento rispecchiava  la descrizione ed era molto accogliente, pulito e fornito di tutto per cui il nostro soggiorno e' stato molto piacevole. Il quartiere tranquillo e caratteristico con un grande parco vicino e due fermate della subway comode.[QWERTY123]This was a great apartment in a great location.  I stayed here with my wife and 3 teenage boys and it was very roomy and comfortable.  Dimitri stayed in constant contact with us in the lead up to our visit and although away when we arrived arranged someone to let us in and show us around.  He also had lots of documentation and maps, menus etc put together which made it easy for us to plan our visit.  The apartment kitchen was very well equipped (probably one of the best we have stayed in) and in general everything was easy.  It is about 5 min walk to 2 different subway lines which get you to lower Manhattan in about 15-20 min or upper in Time Square in about 30 min.  The general area was very safe and lots of good restaurants and supermarket close. I had a couple of jogs around and was very impressed with Prospect Park which is also very close and wish I had more time to explore it.  A great place to stay and excellent host - would happily stay in this apartment again.[QWERTY123]This worked out better than we could have imagined. Dimitri was a wonderful host, there late at night when we arrived and helpful throughout our stay with tips and suggestions about how to enjoy the city.[QWERTY123]Dimitri was een geweldige host, meteen bij aankomst voelden we ons thuis. Hij is altijd beschikbaar voor vragen en/op tips!
Super  schoon appartement met voldoende plaats voor 8 personen. Keuken is volledig uitgerust. Heerlijk om na een drukke dag thuis te komen![QWERTY123]We and my 4 friends had a great time in Dimitri´s appartment. It was really spacious for 5 people and it was nicely furnished and perfectly clean. The kitchen was well equiped and we also enjoyed cooking there. The location is in a nice and calm area, but with only 30 min subway ride central Manhattan can be reached.
Dimitri provided us an information folder and gave us all imaginable additional info. Additionally, he was available all the time for further questions. It was a great stay and we can absolutely recommend the appartment and Dimitri as a host.
[QWERTY123]Think of a home-stay that feels just like home and a host who is there to make you feel wanted when you arrive,  ensures that you have everything to make you comfortable and responds to every query or need as soon as you've messaged...that's our experience as a family for the amazing stay we had at this apartment. If every host and apartment on Airbnb is as awesome as this, I don't think I will ever use a hotel again! Our choice of apartment was dictated by the fact that we were travelling as a large family with a toddler. The apartment has a perfect layout to give everyone enough privacy and yet there is a large living room and well equipped open kitchen whenever we wanted to spend time together. It is airy, well lit and in a very quiet residential neighbourhood. There are window air-conditioners in all the bedrooms and living room, barring the small fourth bedroom which were adequate to keep the apartment cool even on the hottest of days during our stay. The Deli in the adjacent plot as well as the children's playground across the street were super convenient as well as the fact that Dimitri had children's toys, a stroller, a baby chair as well as a crib. We couldn't have asked for a better deal with an infant in the group. In addition, Dimtri had stocked up the apartment with sufficient linen and cleaning supplies for the duration of our stay.The apartment is superbly located with everything one could need, from laundromat, supermarket and great restaurants within a short walking distance. There are several subway connections available within a 7-8 minute walk to take one where ever one wants. The beautiful Prospect Park is also a short walk away.This was our third visit to New York but the first time we stayed outside of Manhattan. My son who studies and lives in Brooklyn would always pitch for us to stay there instead and after this visit, I have seen the wisdom of doing that. One is away from the maddening pace and crowds except when one wants to engage with them and a lot of the eateries I visited in Brooklyn were much better priced and served much better food than those typically on the tourist circuit. Thank you so much Dimitri for being such a perfect host . I would recommend this apartment unreservedly to anyone, especially those travelling in a large group and/or with small children...believe me it can't get any better than this![QWERTY123]L'accoglienza è stata molto affabile, precisa e puntuale.
La casa era stata ben descritta e tutto corrispondeva, anzi abbiamo trovato di più.
Il quartiere gradevole e ben servito.[QWERTY123]Dimitri is a great host. He gave us very detailed and organised information about the apartment, the restaurants and a very good list of Jazz clubs in New York (for those who love Jazz music).
 
Everything about the apartment was exactly as he described. The apartment is great and the neighbourhood is very nice and calm. We staid for a whole week and we had everything we needed and even more.
 
We were able to talked with him for a while and share experiences, he's a really nice guy. 

Thanks Dimitri for everything, we had a great time in New York![QWERTY123]Hi, we spent a wonderfull week in this appartement. It is very well located in Brooklyn, close to everything needed: subway, delis, restaurants, etc... It is exactly as described, in a very quiet street. 
Dimitri is a very nice hote and very helpfull when you need information on the area.
This is the perfect place to chose when visiting New York.
[QWERTY123]Accueil chaleureuse. L'appartement est tres birn situe. J'aime beaucoup le quartier. Si un ami devait venir a NEW YORK je lui recommanderai bien cet appartement. Les hotes sont vraiment accueillant et sympathique.[QWERTY123]Dimitri made us feel very welcome. The apartment was perfect for our family of 6 and situated within easy reach of the subway, local restaurants and Prospect Park. We had a brilliant stay in Brooklyn and were sad to leave. Thank you[QWERTY123]Dimitri's apartment was great - super close to the metro, clean, organized, spacious, and near many great restaurants.  Thanks so much for the wonderful space![QWERTY123]Our three-generational holiday in New York was made special and wonderful thanks to Dimitri and his family. Great communication beforehand, a personal welcome and introduction to the apartment, nothing was too much trouble for Dimitri. The apartment itself is perfect - great location close to a wide variety of restaurants, the subway, Prospect Park. With everything you might need around the house thoughtfully provided, this home from home allowed us to have a wonderful family reunion and holiday whilst feeling a bit like a local, away from all the tourist traps.[QWERTY123]We really enjoyed our stay in Brooklyn (and our first Airbnb experience) in this apartment. It is large, clean, well-appointed and in a clean and safe neighborhood. We lacked nothing! Dimitri was a kind and accommodating host. Very responsive and attentive from our first contact until checkout. Highly recommend this apartment for your NYC stay.[QWERTY123]Absolut great host! Perfect apartment! Nice neighborhood! Fast access to the metro and Manhattan! We surly would give 8 stars at least! Explicit recommendation! - Weiter in deutsch: Wir waren mit unseren 5 erwachsenen Kindern für 10 Tage dort. Die Wohnung ist auch für eine solch lange Zeit perfekt! Dimitri ist ""cool"", immer zuvorkommend und hilfsbereit. Die Wohnung ist gut angebunden und es sind genügend Einkaufsmöglichkeiten in der Nähe vorhanden. 5 Minuten zur Metro und dann 20 Minuten bis Manhattan. Absolute Empfehlung![QWERTY123]Dimitri on aivan loistava isäntä ja asunto todella toimiva. Ennen matkaa ja painkanpäällä Dimitriltä sai kaikenlaista apua, mutta mitään ei tyrkytetty. Hänen perheensä asuu seuraavassa kerroksessa ja on lähellä jos tarvitaan, mutta antaa kaiken yksityisyyden vieraille.
Tarkat ohjeet eri lentokentiltä asunnolle olivat suureksi avuksi ryhmällemme.
Meitä oli 4 henkilöä kolmessa makuuhuoneessa. Asunto toimi erittäin hyvin.
Metrolle on matkaa n. 500m ja kokonaisaika esim. Lincoln Centeriin vie tunnin.[QWERTY123]What a wonderful experience!  Dimitri greeted us at the door and kindly showed us around.  We found the place to be perfect!  Great Brooklyn neighborhood. Close to great restaurants and the subway.  We really had a wonderful experience. Dimitri and the apartment were absolutely fantastic![QWERTY123]After a long flight and good directions to Dimitri's apartment, it was nice to meet Dimitri early the day. He made us comfortable feeling in his apartment, and after a shower we head out to town. The apartment is close enough to the Metro and met what we were looking for. We spent a wonderful time in Brooklyn and New York City. The area is safe and we had a lot of fun jogging around the close by park and nice pedestrian roads. Thumps up for Dimitri and I would highly recommends his apartment for a good time in and around the big apple.[QWERTY123]Sehr netter zuvorkommender Gastgeber, Wohnung sauber und sehr gut ausgestattet - sehr empfehlenswert[QWERTY123]Dimitri's Brooklyn spacious apartment is well situated for exploring both Brooklyn and Manhattan using only public transport. As a host, Dimitri can't be faulted, the apartment was well stocked with everything you need and Dimitri was an attentive host when needed without being intrusive.  I'd recommend this apartment for anyone looking to explore NY on a reasonably modest budget for a few days.[QWERTY123]La casa es muy cómoda, está situada en un barrio tranquilo y residencial, y bien comunicada con Manhattan. La ropa de la casa es agradable, está limpia y dispone de todo lo necesario para sentirte cómodo y como en tu propia casa.[QWERTY123]Nous étions deux familles françaises avec ados, avides de découvrir New York. L'appartement de Dimitri s'est révélé être l'endroit idéal pour se poser après des heures et des kilomètres de marche ! Nous nous sommes sentis comme à la maison : quartier à la fois calme et vivant avec école, jardin d'enfants, commerces pour se ravitailler et le métro à 10 minutes, appartement spacieux (nous étions 8), très propre et hyper calme (pas un bruit la nuit) très appréciable après l'effervescence de Manhattan ! Dimitri s'est montré extrêmement attentif, gentil et amical, proposant son aide à plusieurs reprises (pour récupérer un passeport oublié dans un taxi ou réserver les taxis pour notre départ) ... et c'est avec un pincement au cœur que nous l'avons quitté à la fin d'un séjour extraordinaire et inoubliable.[QWERTY123]Accueil très sympathique, Dimitri est vraiment charmant, présent mais pas trop juste ce qu'il faut, toujours prêt à rendre service. Appartement tels que décrit, spacieux même pour 8 personnes, le quartier est calme, petite épicerie proche et le métro à 10 mn très pratique.[QWERTY123]L'endroit idéal pour visiter NYC en famille existe, c'est l'appartement de Dimitri.
C'est très bien placé, à 10 mn des stations de métro.
L'appartement est vaste, confortable, très propre, très bien équipé, en tous points conforme à la description donnée par le site Airbnb.
Dimitri est très sympathique, attentif à nos demandes et plein de ressources (restaurants, taxis, spectacles....).
Il est tout à fait adapté à une famille de 8 personnes: 3 couples (parents et enfants) et 2 petites filles.
Avons apprécié les espaces communs (cuisine, salon, salle à manger) , les 4 chambres et les 2 salles de bains.[QWERTY123]Ett boende helt i vår smak.
Omgivning lugn o tyst.
Vi upplevde att det var nära och lätt att hitta både till shopping och tunnelbana.
Värden fantastiskt vänlig och hjälpsam.
Brooklyn är en härlig del av New York och med detta boende är man mitt i pulsen.
[QWERTY123]Easy access from JFK and easy commute to Manhattan. The flat is spacious enough for 8  people. Brooklyn is definitely worth exploring on its own. Dimitri has been very accomodative with our arrival and departure schedule. The flat looks excatly like the pictures. Air con in each room was very pleasant in June ! Very good value flat.[QWERTY123]The apartment is as nice as it appears in pictures and located 15 mins walk to the closest subway station (15 mins to Manhattan).
The temperature inside apartment was perfect (even in June/July), also tnx to coolers inside.
We felt very confortable with Dimitri since he replied to all our emails before going to US and was very kindly at our arrival.
Excellent arrangment for warm welcoming, helping, and precious indications.
It was a pleasure to stay there and meet him. See you next time! ;)[QWERTY123]Dimitri var flink og imødekommende. Han var meget fleksibel i forbindelse med nøgleudlevering og hjalp med en ekstra luftmadras.
En fin og ren lejlighed med god plads til 7-8 mand. 10 min gang til subway.[QWERTY123]This was our first experience with air bnb and it was wonderful! We were looking for a place large enough to be comfortable for our family, yet close enough to the city to be able to sightsee and we definitely found it! This residence was clean, comfortable, and and a short walk to two different subway stations! Dimitri was such an attentive host. As soon as we booked, he contacted us with additional information and offered his assistance with questions regarding transportation to and from the airport. Additionally, we had multiple different people coming and going, which Dimitri provided us new sheets and towels for incoming friends/family. He made himself available to answer questions about food and sightseeing. I really can't say enough positive things about the residence itself and the service we received! I would highly recommend this place! On behalf of my friends and family, thank you Dimitri for making our stay so easy and enjoyable![QWERTY123]Our first Airbnb-experience and immediately a perfect one. A great apartment and Dimitri is a great guy. All was as expected and promised. Subway stations within walking distance for easy visits to NYC. Nice neighborhood.[QWERTY123]Unfortunately, Dimitri was on vacation during our stay, but he maintained contact with us even from overseas, and his brother Nikolai was equally accommodating.  We were four adult couples in Brooklyn for our oldest daughter's wedding, so this place was perfect.  Dimitri had supplied us in advance with a volume of information about the area, including a map with all the restaurants within walking distance, sights to see, music venues, etc.  There was an ample supply of everything we could possibly need, and plenty of room to socialize with family.  The only (minor) complaint was that the fourth bedroom doesn't have a window (so no direct air conditioning), but it does have a ceiling fan and additional desk top fan . . . and most weeks in New York City are NOT in the 90's!  Dimitri was completely flexible with our schedules coming and going, especially for our other daughter whose flight didn't leave until evening of our last day.  If the opportunity should ever arise again, we would definitely book the same place![QWERTY123]Notre hôte, Dimitri, nous a très bien accueilli. Il nous a fait visiter l'appartement et nous a recommandé des restaurants et des commerces. Le quartier est agréable, calme et verdoyant. Il y a des commerces à proximité et le métro à 10 minutes à pied. L'appartement est très confortable et bien équipé, il correspond à la description qui en est faite. Nous remercions Dimitri pour cet agréable séjour et sa disponibilité.[QWERTY123]Amazing stay ! It was our first time in NY with my family (we were 6 people) and we could enjoy the 4bedrooms and 2bathrooms..The appartment was even better than the photos. Lot of space, air conditionning, quiet area, located between 2 subway lines (10min walking), easy to find. Dimitri was really kind and made our stay a great moment! I Highly recommend ! Thanks again Dimitri, it was a lovely stay[QWERTY123]Rien à reprocher à mon séjour, Appartement spacieux, très bon rapport qualité prix, très bien équipé, propriétaire arrangeant au niveau arrivée et départ en bref appartement parfait pour notre séjour en groupe à NY.[QWERTY123]I've been a member with airbnb for over 4yrs and i have to say, Dimitris apartment has been our favourtie overall.  Dimitri kept in communication from the moment we booked.  We were a family of 8 adults and 1 infant and were greeted by Dimitris brother when we arrived. Dimitris apartment is exceptionally clean with just the right amount of space needed for us all.  Having 2 bathrooms made it very accessible for our group. Each of the four bedrooms was a perfect size.  We loved the lounge which overlooked the street.  The kitchen is stored with all the equipment needed for a cook in. The apartment is surrounded by beautiful brownhouses, a convenient/deli store next to the apartment which was very handy if we needed anything, a barbar next to the deli store where my sons visited and recommend, 5 minutes up the road there are a line of stores, restaurants and bakeries for an early morning coffee and the subway just 10minutes walk away.  Dimitri is very organised with a folder containing maps, closest subways, menus, restaurants etc... Any other questions you may have, Dimitri is always available to answer. He made our stay so much better by going over and above for us even organising and calling a cab when we were leaving.  You will not go wrong booking with Dimitri.  Thank you Dimitri.  Wishing you and your family all the best.  Till next time[QWERTY123]Great house in a nice neighborhood. Dimitri provided us with extensive info and even booked our cabs for JFK airport. Good value[QWERTY123]Ce logement est absolument tel que décrit sur le site. Il est spacieux, très propre et très bien équipé. Nous étions une famille de 7 personnes (3 générations), nous avons beaucoup apprécié de nous y poser tous les soirs de notre séjour après nos longues journées de découverte. Il est très bien situé, proche des métros et donc des différents lieux de visites. De plus Brooklyn est un borough calme, typique et très plaisant. Dimitri est un hôte parfait, très aimable et serviable. Nous recommandons cet appartement à 200%.[QWERTY123]Dimitri was a  very friendly host. The appartment was excellent, even better than the pictures show. Brooklyn is a beautiful quiet area and very relaxed to stay after a busy day in new york. We had a fantastic week!!! Good wifi[QWERTY123]If you're reading this, it means you're considering Dimitri's wonderful Prospect Heights rental. I would recommend that you go immediately to 'request booking' and snap this one up!

We, a multi-generational family, with members aged 2 - 85 including a son and family visiting from Singapore, rented for 4 days in mid-December 2016 and our stay here could not have been improved: 5 stars really seems inadequate. This cozy apartment is beautifully decorated, with original art work on the walls, comfortable  furniture, great beds and a terrific kitchen. We are foodies, but with a 2 year old, we ended up doing a lot of cooking in and appreciated the good cookware and cooking utensils. When we did eat out, we had lots of places to choose from and despite the foul weather during those days, we walked everywhere.  Supermarkets are nearby as are delis, espresso bars, taquerias, cocktail bars, restaurants, diners, bagel shop, pizza places - better than at home! And Dimitri was always available if we needed assistance or advice. 

The apartment is on a busy street, but no road noise can be heard inside. There is one front bedroom, but we used the back bedrooms and slept in silence. Subways and buses are close-by and taxis are easily hailed or called. For children - playground across the street, Children's Museum relatively near, and for small children, a nice selection of toys in the apartment. For adults, The Brooklyn Museum, Brooklyn Academy of Music,  The Barclay Center, local jazz clubs - whatever your pleasure, Brooklyn has it and Prospect Heights has Dmitri's rental. We hope we've convinced you . You'll be astonished how quickly you'll feel at home and how seamless your visit will be. 

[QWERTY123]Excellent appartement et très bien situé, plusieurs métro à quelques minutes à pieds. Je recommande vivement ![QWERTY123]Very nice and comfortable apartment with plenty of room for our group (6 adults, 3 children). Dimitri is a great host, available but not intrusive. The location was perfect for our house, close to shops, restaurants, and subways but in a quiet part of Brooklyn.[QWERTY123]Great place[QWERTY123]Our stay at the apartment was very satisfactory. It is located in a quiet and charming neighborhood in Brooklyn close to several subway stations. It was nice and clean when we arrived. Dimitri was available throughout the stay. Overall a good experience![QWERTY123]Dimitri is an excellent host. He gave us a lot of information about NYC and Brooklyn and helped us in everything it was at his hand, when we were at NYC and before.
The apartment was excellent, just that photos and comments showed us. We were 7 guests, and it resulted comfortable, neat, clean and well equiped.
The neighborhood is very pretty, secure, with everything at hand. There are three train station within 5 or 6 blocks.[QWERTY123]Excellent appartement. Tres confortable et bien équipé pour 8 personnes. Plusieurs métro a proximité, quartier a la fois tranquille et reposant, et avec quelques bonnes adresses de sorties (restau et bar) et Dimitri est un hôte fort sympathique, discret, avec de bons conseils et de bonnes adresses et arrangeant.  On recommande[QWERTY123]Dimitri is an amazing host. His place was in a great location and was very clean and large. Furthermore, he was always very responsive, and accommodating. I would recommend him without hesitation.[QWERTY123]Dimitri est un hôte charmant. Il nous a aidés à organiser notre séjour en répondant gentiment à toutes nos questions aussi diverses les unes que les autres aussi bien avant qu'après notre arrivée.  Nous sommes arrivés à NYC à 8 tard le samedi soir : 2 couples et 4 ados. Merci à Pyeng de nous avoir accueillis :). L'appartement était parfaitement adapté à notre groupe. Le quartier est très calme et à proximité de quartiers animés. Nous avons adoré Brooklyn en particulier son superbe Prospect park où nous avons pu nous rendre à pied, nous y avons passé nos deux dimanches à observer les Brooklynites pique-niquer, jouer au base-ball ... Brooklyn Heights offre une vue magnifique sur la sky line et nous avons pu facilement aller à Manhattan et dans le Queens. Finissant notre séjour fin mai, nous avons pus aussi tester la plage de Coney Island qui venait d'ouvrir :). Nous reviendrons avec plaisir à NYC où tout le monde a été très gentil avec nous, et espérons pouvoir séjourner à nouveau chez Dimitri à Brooklyn.[QWERTY123]The apartment was spacious enough to comfortably accommodate our whole family — six adults and one toddler -- for over a week. We found the place clean and tidy, and fully equipped down to the last appliance; we really didn’t miss a thing. The apartment is located in a safe and quiet residential neighborhood, about 8-10 minute casual walk to the train.  Dimitri was a wonderful host from the first communication — always available, caring but not intrusive, and showed maximum flexibility during check in/out. Ideal place for a family stay. Will definitely book again![QWERTY123]The location of Dimitri's place is perfect.  It is a quick walk to 2 different subway stations, which allows for easy travel into Manhattan or even out to Coney Island.  The apartment was perfect in size and had everything we needed for breakfast each day and an occasional meal in.  We had 8 people (including a 2 year old) for four of the days and then 6 people for the other three days. 
 Everything was immaculately clean and the apartment was much quieter than we anticipated, which was wonderful! Our 2 year old had space to move around and play and the playground right next door was perfect for allowing him to burn off some extra energy.  We also loved the neighborhood with a wonderful bagel place and grocery store that suited all of our needs.  Dimitri was a fantastic host who helped us get settled and offered wonderful suggestions within the neighborhood.  He went above and beyond!  I highly recommend Dimitri and the apartment, especially for families![QWERTY123]Siamo stati accolti benissimo. L'host è molto gentile e disponibile. L'appartamento è grande ed in posizione strategica. Vicino ai mezzi pubblici ed a ristoranti e supermercati. Un consiglio godetevi Brooklyn perché offre una scena gastronomica veramente interessante.[QWERTY123]We do not really think that Dimitri's place needs more positive evalutions as it already has more than enough. However, just in case anybody is hesitant wether or not rent this appartment, please find below a couple of comments:

A. POSITIVE POINTS
1. Dimitri answers your questions/mails almost instantly
2. Dimitri is very helpful. At your arrival, during your stay, when you leave
3. The appartment is what you see in the pictures. Spacious, well decorated, well equiped (more than expected), very comfortable (nice bedding, nice showers...) very quiet
4. There are enough supermarkets, restaurants, laundromats, etc, next to the house
5. There several lines of the subway close to house (within 10 minutes waking)

B. DRAWBACKS (to mention something)
1. The appartement is not located in Manhattan, so you will have to arrange some time to get there. However, that it is something that you will notice when you pay (way more cheap than an appartment in Manhattan)[QWERTY123]Dimitri and his great apartment are the best![QWERTY123]We come to Brooklyn at least once a year for a reunion in Park Slope. We always use Air bnb. This by far was our favorite place. We will always be checking here first before searching. Close to Subways. Park. Kids playground on the corner. Deli/ little Store right there as well if you get hungry. Dimitri was great. Even carried some of our bags up the stairs.  Waited their for our baby rental equipment to be delivered. Overall a 5 star experience. If you want a 4 bedroom in Brooklyn. Look no further. That is my advice.  We stayed with our two small children. 3 and 1. And my wife's mother. This place was perfect for all. Thanks Dimitri!!!![QWERTY123]Dimitris apt is perfect for large groups - we were 8. Plenty of living space with great kitchen facilities and large bedrooms. It was very clean and well equipped for our 2 week stay. The apt is an easy walk to many subway lines, laundry, food markets, restaurants and shops. We felt like locals on day 2!!  Prospect Park is close also for lovely walks away from hustle and bustle. Dimitri is super friendly, helpful and chilled so it was easy to communicate with him for anything. You are staying in a family house in the middle of 3 apts so you get a nice family vibe with coming and going. We highly recommend this lovely place.[QWERTY123]Dimitri's apartment suited our group really well. The apartment is even better than the photos (is bigger in reality). It is comfortable, cosy and very clean. Dimitri was really helpful- on hand if we needed anything at all. This is a really good location to stay if you want to visit New York but want to stay in a more local (less busy) area but with still lots to do nearby. It's easy to get into New York to do all the tourist things but then also a ton of bars, restaurants and other things to do nearby the apartment. I would recommend this apartment- Dimitri is a great host. If we are lucky enough to go again I would not hesitate in booking this again![QWERTY123]Nous revenons enchantés de notre séjour à NYC. 
Notre logement ? allez-y les yeux fermés ! 
Merci +++ à Dimitri pour son accueil, sa disponibilité et sa sympathie!
L'appartement est très bien situé, tout près du métro. Propre, cosy, fonctionnel, agréable, accueillant.
Nous y étions à deux familles (8 personnes) c'était parfait! 
A refaire ![QWERTY123]The place was amazing!  Super spacious and very close to Prospect Park, the train, and great shops and restaurants. Dimitri was an excellent host. He was so kind and responsive. We would definitely stay here again![QWERTY123]Wir waren mit der ganzen Familie (6 Erwachsene) Anfang Dezember in Brooklyn. Dimitris Wohnung ist das beste, was uns passieren konnte. Es gibt viel Platz, der Wohnraum und die Küche sind bestens ausgestattet und es ist alles sehr sauber. Die nächste Umgebung bietet alles, was man braucht: Supermarkt, American Diner, Bagel Shop und zur nächsten Metro sind es 5 min. Dimitri ist ein sehr netter, aufmerksamer und hilfsbereiter Gastgeber, der für uns immer ansprechbar war. Nochmals lieben Dank und bis zum nächsten Mal.[QWERTY123]Beyond all expectations.

Our organization booked Dimitri's place for 4 participants in our 3 week workshop who were coming from China.  As we regularly host such programs, and book several Airbnb places for each one, we have a lot of experience with hosts and apartments in this city.  Renting Dimitri's apartment was, without question, the best experience we've ever had with Airbnb.  Our participants absolutely loved the apartment, which for a 4-bedroom place in such a fantastic location, is incredibly well priced.  

From our end, Dimitri consistently went above and beyond to make sure everything was easy and perfect, whether in booking the place, helping us ensure that everyone arrived safely (their Chinese phones don't work in the US), or going the extra mile to accommodate our group's needs. The next time we need to book a place Dimitri will be the very top of our list of options.  

If you need a 3 or 4 bedroom place in a great part of the city with easy access to Manhattan, and a wonderfully helpful host, booking this place is simply a no-brainer.[QWERTY123]A fantastic host, friendly, welcoming and helpful. The apartment is fantastic and brilliantly located. We loved our stay and would definitely stay again![QWERTY123]Dimitri was a great host, attentive and kind. The home was spacious and with Musicians above and below the entertainment was an added amenity.[QWERTY123]It's a great location[QWERTY123]Great host!!!
Will definitely recommend to friends!!!
We will definitely be back[QWERTY123]L'appartement est spacieux, chaleureux et très confortable. Nous étions six et nous ne nous sommes pas sentis à l'étroit. L'endroit est calme et la maison contient tout ce dont nous avions besoin. Il y a plein de commerces, bars et restaurants sympas dans les alentours. Dimitri était réactif et accueillant. Il est très disponible pour donner des conseils si on en a besoin. Une très bonne adresse ![QWERTY123]Dimitri is very hospitable and attentive. He maintains excellent communication with his guest ensuring their stay is seamless.[QWERTY123]Dimitri’s place in Brooklyn is terrific! We had seven people of three generations and everyone was very comfortable in this modern apartment. The living/dining/kitchen area was spacious, the kitchen was well equipped, all bedrooms had closets, drawers, lamps, tables, beds, etc. The apartment had nice new windows and shades, air conditioners, rugs, etc. In all, it was just great, as was the location. Near subway stations, parks, museums, restaurants. Dimitri was very pleasant in all our communications and also very helpful during our stay. We would definitely stay here again![QWERTY123]Clean, comfortable, sunny and spacious! I really enjoyed my stay![QWERTY123]This was a really nice place. Visited with my wife and kids as well as my parents and we all loved it. The location was great and the apartment was spacious, clean, functional and made us feel right at home. Perfect for a visit to NYC.[QWERTY123]Very nice place in a good neighbourhood with several shops and other conveniences within easy reach. Family friendly and spacious accommodation with an attentive host.[QWERTY123]Dimitri’s place in Brooklyn was great!. I visited with a group of eight, three generations, including my two kids. A lot of space and great dining and kitchen area. Rooms were comfy and lots of space for clothes and bags. The location was great, with subway station, markets and restaurants close by. Parking in the street is tricky but once you understand the street cleaning cycle then it is fine. Dimitri was available all the time and super helpful. Will definitely stay here again![QWERTY123]This well located apartment worked out great for our trip! We were 2 families of 4 spending a week in New York City. Dimitri even offered us an extra air mattress - which was a great help when a couple of the kids didn’t do so well sharing a double bed.
Loved the neighborhood with a good vibe and plenty of good restaurants. Pretty good proximity to several subway lines also.
Dimitri went above and beyond meeting us for check in and check out and even helping carry a suitcase up and down the flight of steps.
I would definitely stay here again![QWERTY123]Very great stay, Dimitri is the perfect host! Go there without hesitation if you need a place to stay in Brooklyn[QWERTY123]Logement parfaitement équipé , propre et très bien placé pour découvrir New York. Quartier très agréable.
Dimitri répond de façon très réactive aux questions et avait parfaitement organisé notre accueil.[QWERTY123]Excellent location; clean, spacious very well equipped and comfortable apartment! Dimitri is wonderful host, enjoyed staying in both of his apartments[QWERTY123]Dimitri was wonderful and welcoming. The apartment was awesome and so was the neighborhood! Highly recommend[QWERTY123]We were a group of 8 and felt very fortunate to find Dimitri's place with 4 bedrooms and 2 full baths in a wonderful location in Prospect Heights. It was clean and comfortable, with lots of character. Dimitri was a fantastic and gracious host, available for any questions and ready to help out with our group logistiics that were like herding kittens at times. The airbnb is conveniently located near good restaurants and fod stores. The neighborhood is diverse, interesting and very safe. My sister and I felt safe walking home from the subway station at midnight. I fell in love with Brooklyn and would love to visit again and stay with Dimitri!"	40.678105461435976	-73.9642844249074	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/16326	8	200.0	0.9

Bottles of water in the room were a nice touch and very much appreciated.[QWERTY123]Very nice apt.  New remodeled.[QWERTY123]Great place to stay for a while. John is a great host and a great man. The house is very homy. You'll feel right at home.[QWERTY123].[QWERTY123]I really enjoyed my time here in deep south Brooklyn and John was an excellent host - very attentive to any concerns that I had and a very welcome presence when he's around. 

The room itself is a great space with a super-comfy bed and lovely traditional ceiling fan. The street is pleasant, tree-lined and quiet and the townhouse is located a short, convenient walk from the F train, which has been perfect for getting to my office here.

It's easy to see why John's a Super Host and I look forward to staying with him again![QWERTY123]John was a great host. He was very responsive before and during our visit. He really wanted to make sure we had a good stay. It was our 1st Airbnb experience and wasn't sure what to expect. Was happy to find street parking in a safe neighborhood.[QWERTY123]Clean, quiet, well-run home, very close to the subway[QWERTY123]John was always responsive during my stay. He answers back immediately when you request something from him. The neighborhood is very calm and secure. The rooms are clean and John does his best to make comfortable your stay. It takes approximately 45 minutes by subway to reach Manhattan mid-town and the house is located one block to the subway station. I recommend John's place."	40.64748608166989	-73.97236954007958	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/2539	4	149.0	0.7

Nous avons apprécier L'appartement qui est très bien situé. Agréable, propre et bien soigné. C'est idéal pour une famille de 3 ou 4 personnes.
Petits soucis en arrivant il y avait personne pour nous recevoir, et il manquait le savon pour la douche, le liquide vaisselle, nous les avons reçu de surlendemain. Il y a aussi le bruit du Métro de NY, donc une première nuit difficile si on est pas habitué. Jennifer est correcte le remboursement de la caution était très rapide.  A part ces petits détails notre court séjour c'est bien passé. 
Si j'ai la possibilité de revenir sur NY pour les vacances, je reprendrai à ""The Midtown Castle""
Jean
Possession - Ile de La Réunion
[QWERTY123]Great experience.[QWERTY123]I've stayed with my friend at the Midtown Castle for six days and it was a lovely place to be. A big spacious room with a pointy roof, which really makes you feel like staying in a castle. The location is perfect. It is just a few steps from Macy's Time Square and Theatre District. Everything worked just perfect with the keys etc. Thank you so much Jennifer, we had a great time in New York.
Attention: it's on the 4th floor without a lift :-) but definetely worth it![QWERTY123]We've been staying here for about 9 nights, enjoying to be in the center of the city, that never sleeps...short ways to everywhere in Manhattan, by subway or by walk. Midtown castle is a beauftiful and tastful place, Jennifer and Tori relaxed and friendly hosts - thats why we - the three Berliners - recommand that place! Good to have WiFi and a little kitchen too![QWERTY123]We had a wonderful stay at Jennifer's charming apartment! They were very organized and helpful; I would definitely recommend staying at the Midtown Castle![QWERTY123]Hi to everyone!
Would say our greatest compliments to Jennifer, the host of Midtown Castle. We spent in this lovely apartment in the heart of Manhattan one month (April, 2012) and will remember this time as ours best.
The apartment is pretty spacious and great located - the 5-th Ave right around the corner. There is everything you can need during your short or long stay. Jennifer is very friendly, vigorous and very responsible host. Thanks her and highly recomend this apartment for everyone who are looking for a quiet place right in the center of the boiling Midtown![QWERTY123]Jennifer was very friendly and helpful, and her place is exactly as advertised. The location is very convenient, and it was a pleasure to stay at the Midtown Castle. I definitely recommend it :)

Thanks ![QWERTY123]This apartment is like a real castle old and unique. The age- related stains on the bathroom floor and dark discolorations in the carpet too indeed indicate that the building was built a long, long time ago. 
We weren’t happy with the way the apartment was cleaned. Jennifer, the host sent in a cleaning lady right the next morning and therefore did everything she thought was appropriate to make our stay comfortable. She let us know that guest satisfaction is important to her.   
After we found out that the key for the main entrance was missing by locking ourselves out in the middle of the night she was so kind to bring us the missing key within an hour. 
We had to leave the apartment a few days earlier because we suffered from an allergic reaction (which has never happened before and never after) related to the air conditioner as our doctor told us. 
The apartment is located in a great area! Subway stations are just two minutes away! The area seems quite safe although there are “special” adult video stores located in the same street nearby.  
A deli/grocery store is next to the building, a 24 hours open pharmacy is across the end of the street! 
[QWERTY123]Jennifer's place was in a great midtown location, close to the subway, Bryant Park and Times Square.  She met us after midnight to give us keys to the place, which we appreciated.

The apartment is spacious for two people; a deli next door is perfect for last minute toiletries.

Thanks for allowing us to stay![QWERTY123]Jennifer is a very nice host. Everything is clean and she really takes care of her guests. We can only recommend her apartment to others.[QWERTY123]This is a cute studio in a wonderful location with some quirky and interesting traits including a giant translucent skylight (makes the neatest noise when rain falls on it, sounds like clapping!), warm couch, and trinkets that are fun (hoola hoops, juggling pins? sure, why not!?). 

Great place, great location![QWERTY123]A great location, a very comfortable space and a helpful host. Everything that makes Airbnb great![QWERTY123]Jennifer's place is cozy and a short walking distance from Time Square. The place was big enough for two. 
Jennifer left detailed instructions and was also helpful in terms of recommending great places in NY.

Everything was great:)[QWERTY123]We hebben genoten van ons verblijf in het appartement van Jennifer. Prima en centraal gelegen, ook t.o.v. openbaar vervoer. Het daklicht maakt dat het prettig licht is en ruim aanvoelt. Enige minpuntje is de vier trappen.[QWERTY123]Jennifer was very good at communicating with us prior to our arrival. Although she could not meet with us herself, she had a friend meet with us to give us the keys and more information when we arrived. She was also very accommodating with our flight schedule and check out. 

The apartment was great overall, although just a little smaller than we expected from the pictures. Our favorite part was of course the skylight and dart board she had hanging. The apartment was in clean condition when we arrived, which is always a good thing!

The location was amazing, close to everything, a great place to stay for our first visit to New York.  It is on the top floor, so we definitely got our workout in going up and down those stairs each day! 

We had a blast! 

Thanks Jennifer! 
[QWERTY123]I love this space.  It is truly a gem in the heart of Manhattan.  The location could not be better.  Very clean, comfy, and great warm inviting energy.  Jennifer was very clear and responsive.[QWERTY123]This was our first Airbnb experience, and Jennifer really made it great! No more hotels for us in the future ;) The communication was friendly and she replied very fast. Just great!![QWERTY123]Great location, in the middle of everything. The apartment is well maintained and clean. Jennifer is very responsive to texts/messages. I had a great time there.[QWERTY123]Jennifer was without doubt an amazing host, she was incredibly kind and welcoming and made sure we had a great weekend. She supplied books and notes with all sorts of information about NY, the flat and the area. The flat is in the perfect location, not more than a 10 minute walk from Times Square and about the same distance from Penn station. The apartment itself is just as described, great for one or two people. I highly recommend the apartment and will surely use it again next time I'm in NY![QWERTY123]Jennifer was an unbelievable host! Great communication and made sure I was all set for my big weekend with my college age daughter.

I love all parts of NYC, but if you want Midtown, this is just about perfect. The place is sunny and bright and surpisingly little noise from the street on Friday and Saturday night. Plus, we felt very safe.

Size wise, 1-2 people is probably perfect. Any more may feel a little cramped.

Lastly, most Airnb places I stay feel liked they have been furnished by a recent college grad. It's clear that Jennifer lives here and was so accomodating opening up her home to us.[QWERTY123]The Midtown Castle was a great choice for our weekend stay. It is centrally located, and walking distance for most of our stops. The apartment was clean, nicely decorated, and the perfect size for our trip. Jennifer was a great host, and made our self check-in very easy! She gave us all of the information we needed for a smooth trip.  I would highly recommend this place to other visitors, and would consider staying there again when we are back in NYC![QWERTY123]Tiene una ubicación excelente. Buen equipamiento del apartamento. Tal cual se ve en las fotos[QWERTY123]Jennifer is a gracious host with an amazing one of a kind space you won't find anywhere in Mid Manhattan.

The perfect home away from home esp. if you're on business.

Note, the stair climb is LEGIT, not fake news. Jennifer is an excellent communicator with very helpful and clear directions,

The 4 flights of stairs will definitely let you know you're in NYC :)[QWERTY123]Jennifer was super friendly and helpful. Great host with an amazing studio apartment right in the middle of NYC. Everything is walking distance! The Empire State Building, Times Square, and New York library were all around the corner or less than 15 minutes walk. Best location ever and great relaxing place to stay.

Quick note: Apartment is located on the 4th floor with no elevator so make sure you don’t have very heavy luggage. In any case it’s a good workout :)[QWERTY123]Jennifer's space was such a lovely experience. PreCheckin and checkin was detailed and seamless, she made it easier on us and answered all questions so quickly. The space itself is such a unique, clear & zen energy- we loved it. Not to mention it was very clean & close to everything! Definitely be prepared for the 4flight workout (we appreciated that)! We enjoyed the space and location & would recommend this to anyone coming to explore the city!![QWERTY123]This is a nice apartment and it looks like in the photo. It is well located and Jennifer was very nice and super responsive! She also let me have a late check out at no extra cost, which was very kind of her. 5 stars for that! On the negative side, it was rather cold in the room. I stayed there for 6 nights end of November, beginning of December so the central heating should be on, but it only worked occasionally (this is a building from (Phone number hidden by Airbnb) and the amenities are a bit worn and probably never have been updated). There is an extra heater but it is not sufficient to heat up the room cause the ceiling is high and the glas roof is not a good insulation. Consequently for the majority of the time the temperature inside was between (Phone number hidden by Airbnb) C) which was disagreeable. Second point was the noise from 3 construction sites in the street, one just opposite the building. They started work early and the clearing of rubble was sometimes done past midnight and very loud. Once the heating problem is sorted out and the construction is done it will be a nice place to stay.[QWERTY123]Beautiful and stylish spot in a very unique building! Jennifer is a wonderful host and was kind enough to meet us for out late-night check-in. We loved the apartment![QWERTY123]Location Location Location.
Outstanding location near to everything walking, by train or bus.
We enjoy our rent there.

Alonso[QWERTY123]Great place. Would definitely recommend! Jennifer is really sweet and easy going.[QWERTY123]We really enjoyed our stay at Jennifer’s apartment. She was very hospitable and answered any questions we had promptly. The hike up the four flights of stairs with the luggage was a challenge. 
The location was amazing. Central to everything, 5 min walk to the subway, close to time square. There was a bit of noise at night from all the construction happening around the apartment but Jennifer supplied us with ear plugs which worked a treat. Would highly recommend her apartment[QWERTY123]This apartment is convenient and functional.  The huge skylight makes it feel open and airy. And it is located smack dab in the middle of Manhattan.  Highly recommended.[QWERTY123]The Midtown Castle is a beautiful place to stay in the center of the city.  Truly a sanctuary with everything you need. Little touches of nature and beauty throughout. Waking up with the sun from the skylight was amazing.[QWERTY123]Jennifer is very nice and responsive. The location of the apt is great. However 
- the bed was small and smelly. The apt also smelled weird. We had to sleep on a mattress on the floor
- the building is very old. 
- the apt is not clean and due to construction it was very noisy. 

However. We do appreciate the stay and the location[QWERTY123]Jennifer es un anfitrión increíble. Siempre estuvo comunicada y dejó listos todos los detalles para que mi estancia fuera perfecta. Me sentí como en casa.
El departamento es maravilloso, con mucha luz y una sensación de tranquilidad, además de una ubicación inmejorable, justo en el centro de Manhattan!! A unos pasos del Empire State. Totalmente recomendable!![QWERTY123]Awesome location, spotless, wonderfully accommodating host. I will definitely stay here next time I am in NYC[QWERTY123]The location made getting to Time Square easily accessible. Apartment was quiet and no disturbances from neighbors at all.[QWERTY123]Jennifer’s place is a wonderful retreat in the middle of the busy city. The bed was super comfy- and the whole space/energy of the place felt very calm and cozy. You can hear some noise in the street (I expected this because you are literally in the heart of the city) but I slept like the proverbial baby every night. Jennifer was kind enough to leave ear plugs in case we needed them but we never did. I definitely recommend her place![QWERTY123]Great place to stay, very good host"	40.75362072657246	-73.98377381114605	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/2595	2	225.0	0.725

Within walking distance, there are many shops, restaurants and supermarkets. The busy main street of Williamsburg (Bedford Avenue) is just a few subway stations away.[QWERTY123]Julia's room is lovely. Very light and bright. Jae made us feel very welcome and it was really cool to sit out on the roof and enjoy the view. Fantastic transport links into Manhattan. We'd definitely stay again![QWERTY123]We had a confortable stay. The room is really nice and bright. The location is perfect, not to busy as in Manhattan but only few stops away from the living areas. It's only 5min from Bedford av. (nice bars, restaurants and shops) and a few minutes more from Manhattan. Jae made us feel welcome and gave us good suggestions. We hope that next time we will have more time to see you and have a drink.
Thanks again.[QWERTY123]thx J & J for having us. it all worked out just fine. looking forward to see the Ugly Original colection on-line btw :-)  hope to meet you 2 next time! ciao for now. Amaury & Giovanni[QWERTY123]Julia and Jae are the loveliest hosts I've ever had.
Me and my boyfriend spent a few weeks in their apartment and it felt like we had known each other forever. The place is clean and tidy. We were free to use the living room and the kitchen. Our room was very tidy and clean upon our arrival. There was clean sheets on the bed and some freshly washed towels. The bed is super comfy. You can do your laundry downstairs in the cellar. If you're the kind of person who likes to have your privacy you will be very happy here since the hosts are at times barely at home and if they are they won't throw big parties and they will respect your privacy. However, if they are at home they will be happy to give you advice on getting around in NYC and tell you about lovely restaurants and other things to do and places to visit. The apartment is located very close to the L train so it only takes about 10-15 minutes to get into Manhattan. Jae took me to some lovely restaurants and bars in the neighborhood. We've become good friends with Julia and Jae and we'll definitely stay in touch. THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING JULIA AND JAE!!! We hope to see you soon again. D&S[QWERTY123]The host canceled my reservation 7 days before arrival.[QWERTY123]My boyfriend and I spent 6 days in Julia's apartment. The apartment is really pretty and clean, as is the room; the bed super comfortable, lots of space in drawers to put away clothes etc. The subway is only 3 mins away (great!), the housemate really nice - 5 stars to ""Ugly Original"" - just a shame we never got to meet Julia herself!! Everything went very smooth, from booking to getting there to receiving keys. We highly recommend this place, and hope to hear from Julia if ever she comes to Sweden/Denmark :)[QWERTY123]Julia's BK Lodge was wonderful! Great apartment in a great location. The place was clean and comfortable. We didn't see Julia during our stay but we met Julia's roommate and her dog - who we rarely saw as well. I would definitely consider staying here again to take advantage of their rooftop patio. It was a great place to call home for a week. Thanks Julia![QWERTY123]Awesome hosts. Awesome apartment. My own private rooftop deck overlooking Manhattan.  What more could you want?[QWERTY123]Julia's place was as advertised; comfortable, in a good location, and with an outstanding rooftop. There is plenty to see/do in the surrounding neighbourhoods (e.g. great street art, excellent food) and getting into Manhattan is quick & easy.
Didn't see much of Julia as we were coming and going at different hours but she was a friendly & courteous host.[QWERTY123]The host made me feel very welcome when I arrived at the apartment. The place was really clean and the room itself was wonderful. I felt very welcome and truly enjoyed my stay there. I would recommend staying at this apartment to anyone. The area is really nice and the subway literally right round the corner! Great shops near by too. Thank you for having me for my 2 months![QWERTY123]Julia and company are great hosts! The apartment is in a good location, convenient to mass transit as well as the Williamsburg bridge to Manhattan.  The room is a good size, the light from outside is lovely and the bathroom is clean with a nice bathtub/shower.[QWERTY123]Julia's apartment was exactly like in the ad.  Her apartment was located in a friendly neighbourhood in Williamsburg, a few minute walk from the subway.  Julia provided clear directions to get to her place as well as some recommendations of local favourites. 

Julia's room was on the second floor of the apartment, with its own bathroom and access to the rooftop.  Her room was clean and decorative.  Julia was out of town the weekend we stayed over, but she was helpful and checked in on us even while she was away.

 My friend and I really enjoyed our three night stay at Julia's place.  We would definitely recommend staying at Julia's place.[QWERTY123]Staying at Julia's place was pretty wonderful: super spacious and clean space, amazing rooftop view of city, and a still authentic part of Williamsburg with some neighborhood gems (vegan doughnuts, artisan coffee, and a few hip neighborhood cafés/bars). Easy access to the city (metro or urban hiking), and a 24 hr. organic convenience store around the corner.[QWERTY123]Julia stayed in constant contact with us before we arrived at the apartment and was super friendly and helpful.  The room was exactly as described on the site and we had amazing views of Manhattan from the roof-top balcony.  We felt like it was our own private apartment as the room was quite spacious, we could make use of the balcony for breakfast and the bathroom is on the same floor and is private.  We had an awesome stay in Brooklyn and are looking forward to our next visit to NYC![QWERTY123]Julia was communicative and she lives in a great area. She was helpful and great to work with the entire time. Thanks Julia![QWERTY123]Julia was a great host and she was also to show me the place before she left. The location was great and really close to the L train. The other roommates were also great.[QWERTY123]Julia and Jae are such welcoming, friendly people and their place is just great. We had an amazing time and would definitely stay there again!

The space is huge and the view is breathtaking. Everything – the room, the bathroom, the shared kitchen – is clean and fresh. Julia and Jae work a lot, but when they’re home, they’re super nice to hang out with. We had a lot of fun with them and also really appreciated the list of neighborhood gems Julia sent us before our arrival and all the cool bar tips Jae shared with us. 

We totally fell in love with the neighborhood, which feels really safe and is close to just about everything. The subway is just around the corner and the area is full of nice bars, restaurants and more. 

Both Julia and Jae were really helpful and Julia gave us all information we could possibly need before our arrival in Brooklyn. Everything just went smooth! 

Thank you so much, Julia and Jae! We hope to see you soon again![QWERTY123]Unfortunately we didn't meet Julia personally during our stay, but at the moment we booked her room she was very helpful and kind. We met her roommate Adriana, who's also a great person and made us feel home.
The apartment is very clean, comfortable and quiet. We were impressed with the style.
The neighborhood is full of services and places to eat, in a few steps. 
We would love to stay there again, for sure!![QWERTY123]This was our second time staying with Julia and once again – we loved it! The apartment is clean and just beautiful, in a cool and safe neighborhood, very close to the subway. The room is big, has a great rooftop of its own and a separate bathroom, which is perfect for us. 
Julia is a wonderful host; welcoming, helpful and really friendly. She let us both have our privacy and hang out with her, when there was time. 
We look forward to staying with Julia again! 
[QWERTY123]Julia 's place is located just 2 minutes from the L train. The place has a great view over the manhatten skyline. It's clean and Julia is a great host.[QWERTY123]The place is beautiful and well located, close to L train (1 min walk). Julia was an excellent host and made us fell at home. The bedroom is big, neat and clean and has a private bathroom and a private rooftop with an incredible view. The neighbourhood is quite and has some groceries, delis and cafes nearby. I would highly recommend it![QWERTY123]The host canceled this reservation 2 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.[QWERTY123]We stayed at Julia's place for 9 days. The building is like 2 min walk from L subway line. The neighbourhood is safe, we were only two girls there, everyday we came home alone around 1AM and we never experienced anything dangerous. There is a lift in the building, so you don't have to carry your heavy luggage on the 4th floor ;-) The room looks nice, exactly the same as on photos. It's quite big, clean, with clean private bathroom and entrance to the rooftop. Julia is a very nice and positive person. Even though we spent whole days visiting the city, we were in touch with her via (Hidden by Airbnb) . We highly recommend that place and the NYC![QWERTY123]My boyfriend and I spent a wonderful week in NYC for the first time and we decided to stay in Julia's house because the good location but, above all, for the greats reviews of the previous guests but was better than we expected!!
For the first time, she was really helpful with us both before and during the us stay. 
The house is very nice with a great location in a cute area of Brooklyn with easy connections to go anywhere with the L train and with plenty of places around to have some breakfast (like bagles in ""Bread brothers bagel cafe"" or donuts in ""Dunn Well"", (recommended by Julia and very appreciate cause was delicious!) or launch and dinner. 
The bed is super confortable and the room so spacious and has a private bathroom. It has a terrace as well, from where we could enjoy the lovely views of the skyline of Manhattan. 
We felt extremely fortunate to have found this place and definitely, if we repeat NY at destiny, we will choice Julia's house again!![QWERTY123]Une semaine magnifique à New York chez Julia. Les indications qu’elle nous a laissé par mail avant notre arrivée étaient détaillées, complètes et nous ont permis de passer un agréable séjour chez elle. A noter que nous avons eu l’occasion de la rencontrer que le dernier jour, au moment du départ, lorsqu’elle rentrait de ses vacances à l'étranger. Nous n'avons pas rencontré son autre colocataire, mais avons fait la connaissance d'un couple qui louait pour la semaine la 3ème chambre de l'appartement. Même si nous n’avons pas utilisé la cuisine, celle-ci semblait fort bien équipée. Le salon est petit et joli. On accède à notre chambre par le petit escalier en fer dans le salon. Il s’agit d'une pièce accueillante et propre, grande (bien assez de place pour poser plusieurs bagages. La chambre donne directement sur un rooftop, que nous avons beaucoup utilisé le soir en rentrant ou pour boire un café le matin. Une salle de bain privative avec baignoire se trouve également à cet étage. Le quartier est très sympa et proche de Manhattan. L’appartement est à 3min à pied de station la station Montrose de la ligne L. Bref, on recommande chaudement. Sauf peut-être pour les personnes qui souhaitent se réveiller au milieu des buildings ;)[QWERTY123]If you’re looking at this place; book it! Julia’s place was such a great spot! Julia was so lovely and communication was second to none! She was extremely helpful and answered any and all questions! The place was in a great spot, super close to the subway (<5mins walk), close to great food and bars/everything you could ever want/need! The place was clean and fully equipped with everything! Couldn’t recommend this place enough and will be staying here next time I’m in NYC! Thanks so much Julia :)[QWERTY123]I spent 3 months in this amazing accomodation. Julia is a lovely, helpful and caring person. The apartment is really nice, new, clean. As well as the building. The area is the best one in the whole City of New York. Really young but also quite and safe. It is close to Union Square, that it is the center of the world, and the train stop is 3 minutes walking far. You can find everything around there: good and fashion restaurants, cheap places to get brunch, lunch or whatever with good food, groceries, shops, vintage markets. But the apartment is quite, you can get the best sleep ever, thanks to the silence and the comfortable pillows and matressess. The apartment has 3 rooms. 2 downstairs with a nice bathroom, and one (penthouse) upstairs. This one, that I rented, is huge, well decorated, with its own private bathroom and, the best part, it has an amazing view thanks to an huge terrace. Julia provides everything for your need and she is always in touch for any need. Wifi free and very fast, the living room is very nice and comfortable. The kitchen is full of everything you might need to cook.  It's impossible to leave a negative comment about her and her place. If this happens is because of dirty or unpolite guests. Because this is Just perfect.

I am looking forward to come back to Nyc soon and I will stay there again. I've been more than  once in Nyc and I can tell you that this is an awesome solution for a comfortable and unforgettable stay. Thanks Julia! Love you! And I am missing you and your room already! See you soon[QWERTY123]O apartamento é muito bom! Não poderíamos ter feito uma escolha melhor para nossos 13 dias em Nova York. Quarto grande, limpo e confortável. Ótima área externa com uma linda vista de Manhattan. Cama super confortável, excelente pra descansar depois de um longo dia de caminhadas por NYC. Super bem localizado, a linha L fica a 1 minuto de caminhada do apartamento. Várias opções de delis e pizza por perto - não posso deixar de recomendar o mercado Azure (sanduíches muito bons com preços justos). O bairro é muito agradável, seguro e silencioso. A Julia foi uma host maravilhosa, nos deu um excelente suporte durante todo o tempo mesmo antes de confirmarmos a reserva. Nossa primeira experiência com o Airbnb foi sensacional graças a ela. Sem dúvidas recomendamos o apartamento e adoraríamos ficar lá novamente![QWERTY123]Appartement très bien situé à 5 stations de métro (ligne L) de Manhattan. Notre chambre avec salle de bain attenante donnait directement sur la terrasse, très appréciable par beau temps. Une station City Bike toute proche permet d'utiliser des vélos pour les plus sportifs...[QWERTY123]Julia’s instruction is clear and detailed. Though I didn’t meet her in person, everything worked out fine from getting the keys to check out. I had most amazing trip in NYC and part of the reason is staying at her’s! Location is super. Highly recommend.[QWERTY123]Super emplacement! Nous n avons pas croisé Julia mais l entrée dans les lieux a été très simple. Julia est très disponible si nous avons besoin de quelque chose.[QWERTY123]We stayed at Julia's place for 5 weeks and had the best time! Everything was as described, the apartment is well equipped and very clean! The room is great with the most comfortable bed we ever slept in, a private bathroom and a big rooftop deck to yourself with impressive views. The area around the apartment is very nice , it's right next to a subway station (1 min walk) and only a few stops away from Bedford Avenue and Manhattan. Julia was great, helpful and responsive at all times. We would totally recommend this place !![QWERTY123]We had a marvellous stay in Julia's penthouse! We were there for a ten day holiday and it was the perfect place to explore New York from. The room is spacious and clean with a super comfortable bed and space to hang clothes and store belongings, and lots of power outlets to charge devices. The bathroom has a powerful shower which was always hot and the balcony has incredible panoramic views of Manhattan.
We experienced all weather on our trip (torrential rain, fog, high humidity and glorious sunshine) and the room remained temperate at all times. Also surprisingly quiet considering it's in the middle of a big city. 

We felt safe and secure there throughout our stay and Julia's housemates were really welcoming. It's perfectly located with the subway just around the corner to take you straight into Manhattan and fun areas nearby in Brooklyn. 

Communication with the host was great, checking in and out was very easy and Julia provided lots of detailed instructions and great tips for places to eat and explore nearby. 
Julia very kindly left some umbrellas out for us to use when we mentioned it was likely to rain on our trip, which was a thoughtful touch.

We would definitely love to stay here again next time we're in NYC and highly recommend it to anyone else coming to the city.[QWERTY123]Fantastic room, spacious and clean with a nice private bathroom and an amazing rooftop deck with view of the skyline. Great location only a few steps from the subway / L train and 15 minutes to Manhattan.  Julia is a very friendly and accommodating host, we would come back any time.[QWERTY123]Super Apartment, tolles Preis-Leistungs-Verhältnis, sehr nett eingerichtet mit direkt anschließendem eigenen Bad, alles sauber und das Zimmer hat eine tolle private sehr große  Dachterrasse mit Blick auf Brooklyn. :) Die beiden Mitbewohner sind ebenfalls sehr nett. Die Subway Station ist nur wenige Gehminuten entfernt inkl. Cafés, Restaurants ect. 
Ich würde diese Unterkunft jederzeit wieder buchen und weiterempfehlen!"	40.70855778333159	-73.94236227640226	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/3330	2	70.0	0.875
7	3831	"lisa is a wonderful, kind and thoughtful host.  the listing is 100% accurate -- there is an entire floor for the guest, with a full bath and kitchen area looking out over a leafy backyard.  everything i needed for my one month stay.[QWERTY123]The best thing about this place is the location! You're right in the middle of Clinton Hill with easy access to restaurants on Franklin Avenue and in Fort Greene. You're also close to the C and G trains, so transportation is easy. 
The space is clean and neat, if spare. It really is much more of a one-floor apartment than a private room, as you will only have interactions with the family on the shared stairs and stoop. There is, however, no door at the top of the stairs so sounds travel from the rest of the house. Lisa-Roxanne was kind and accommodating, and the children are adorable![QWERTY123]LisaRoxanne was friendly and helpful. The room was large, light filled and comfortable.[QWERTY123]LisaRoxanne is very nice and communicative. The space is clean, quiet and safe. My family stayed there and thought it was great for what they needed. She provided a fan when asked and coffee filters, which was very nice of her.[QWERTY123]Lisa was a very pleasant and nice host that accommodated to our timing of arrival and short stay in New York. Also we have a huge place all to ourselves. I would definitely come back here again![QWERTY123]Lisa était sympa, toujours prête à aider. L'étage dans lequel nous avons logé était lumineux, spacieux et bien chauffé. Je recommande ce logement.[QWERTY123]The reservation was canceled 5 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.[QWERTY123]We were greeted by Lisa's husband at the door. They made us feel welcomed and she was in the middle of preparing our beds for us when we got there. I appreciate her flexibility to make a same day reservation. Place is big upstairs with kitchen, bed and bath. We met her son Carlos who was super cute. We did not stay long enough to explore the area but it was easy to find her place. Would stay again![QWERTY123]Lisa and her family were warm and welcoming hosts. The place was clean and we had all we wanted in the kitchen. We had a high speed internet and a good air conditioner. Personally, I loved the neighbourhood artistic. We had a nice experience.[QWERTY123]The place was great. Lisaroxanne was a great host and provided everything we needed including towels, toothbrushes, soap, sheets. The house is walking distance to the subway. Would definitely stay again.[QWERTY123]Bien que la chambre soit défraichi, nous avons bien dormi et profité des lieux.  Quartier calme et j'ai pu laissé la voiture a proximité sécuritairement.  Merci Lisa[QWERTY123]LisaRoxanne met us out on the sidewalk, and was right there to answer the phone as we passed with help for parking. She was very down to earth and friendly! Her little son we met is adorable![QWERTY123]She is so wonder full. We got friendly and homely welcome. The apartment and neighbour hood were calm and quite. We (3 people) slept nicely and I have to emphasis the neatness of rooms, which was remarkable.
Subway station is walk able distance only. 
I wish every success for LisaRoxanne[QWERTY123]LisaRoxanne and her family are some of the most hospitable people I've ever met. They not only accepted our reservation request last minute, but made us extremely comfortable by going above and beyond to accommodate us with anything and everything that we could possibly need or want. They were also very helpful finding things to do in the area. I will definitely be booking my next and many more stays with them and recommend them to anyone looking to get a more personable stay in New York.[QWERTY123]Lisa was great! Communication prior to the stay was good and Lisa made us feel welcome. The room is fine, spacious if spare but that  is clear from the pictures. There were a lot of thoughtful details as well, like spare toothbrushes, coffee, creamer etc. One of the things I was worried about in NYC was parking, and there was plenty of on street parking. There was a market on the corner. The house is currently being renovated so chances are you will find it even better when you go. My wife and I had a great time, she especially loved her surprise![QWERTY123]Han sido unos días muy agradables. La casa está super bien comunicada. Cocina, lavabo y habitación ""privadas"" en la misma planta. Cuando estuvimos estaba a punto de reformar la cocina así que será aún mejor. Lisa es simpática y siempre está dispuesta a ayudar en todo lo que pueda.[QWERTY123]LisaRoxanne is very kind and accommodative host. Great location with private full kitchen and bathroom. Room was clean and fully equipped. Also her local recommendation is great, we had really nice dinner at one of her restaurants list. I would love to stay her house again when I come back to Brooklyn.[QWERTY123]Nice apartment, good location. Very near to Subway, very nice host[QWERTY123]We had a very good time at LisaRoxannes house. The house is currently being renovated so the room is still fairly simple and undecorated. But the place is very clean and tidy, the bed sleeps wonderful and LisaRoxanne and her husband are wonderful people doing all they can to make you feel comfortable. Special plus for us: We had our one-and-a-half-year-old kid with us and that was no problem whatsoever. If you go to NYC, stay there - you are in the best hands![QWERTY123]Our stay at Lisa's was just perfect. The bedroom and bathroom were clean and spacious. 

The location is fine, just a few blocks from the subway. From there to Manhattan, it only takes around 30 minutes. 

Lisa was so careful and thoughtful about our needs. 
[QWERTY123]LisaRoxanne was great host. She communicates well in advance to make sure the transition goes well. The place is very generous. Its a private room with full kitchen/bath. It's central to A,C,and G train. Awesome pizza joint in walking distance. The neighborhood is safe and full of history with its architecture. I wouldn't hesitate to stay here when I'm in town.[QWERTY123]Alla fine tutto è bene ciò che finisce bene...qualche problema iniziale dovuto alla presenza di lavori in cucina il giorno del nostro arrivo e quello seguente, mi è stato offerto un risarcimento per il disagio, ma vista la pronta disponibilità per soddisfare le nostre esigenze ho rifiutato....alla fine il soggiorno da lunedì a lunedì è stato piacevole la zona è tranquilla un po distante da manhattan ma comunque facilmente raggiungibile con la subway..[QWERTY123]LisaRoxanne is a great host! We came about an hour and a half earlier than expected, and she was totally fine with that. She sent me suggestions for brunch near her place and also offered to help my friend find a good parking spot on the street. She is friendly and had everything we could have needed (towels, toothbrush, toothpaste, hair dryer, etc.) and offered to get us some bagels for breakfast. The kitchen has been recently renovated, and the bedroom was very comfortable and fit our needs exactly. Check in and out were both easy![QWERTY123]Great place to stay in a great location with friendly hosts![QWERTY123]La descripción del departamento es absolutamente real. Un espacio cómodo, accesible y práctico con su baño y cocina hechos a nuevo y súper equipados. 
Si bien no pasamos mucho tiempo allí, fue justo lo que necesitábamos para nuestra estadía en NYC. Cerca del metro y de lugares hermosos para comer, mercados de todo tipo. El barrio es inmejorable.
Lisa es una excelente anfitriona, se ocupó de todo y más. Nos recibió compras realizadas por internet antes de nuestra llegada y estuvo pendiente de nuestra comodidad 24/7. 
¡Sin duda la recomendamos y volveríamos!
Gracias Lisa!!![QWERTY123]Je suis très heureux de mon séjour: accueil chaleureux , logement très bien équipé , confortable et calme;
J'espère pouvoir y retourner et je le recommande à mes enfants et à mes amis.
Nos hôtes sont charmants et très serviables;
Merci à Airbnb de m'avoir indiqué cette adresse.
Sincèrement
jlouis[QWERTY123]LisaRoxanne was very responsive and accessible prior to our arrival.  She greeted us on arrival and was very helpful in orienting us to the neighborhood.  The space was clean and neighborhood felt safe.  On-street parking was plentiful on the weekend.  She and her family were there throughout the time we were there and being on the top floor there was enough separation and privacy that it was not a problem.  She was very accommodating and gracious when we had a last minute addition, needing an additional bed.  Great value --  I highly recommend![QWERTY123]Neighborhood was safe, close to subway, space was great and just what we needed.  It was way better than a small hotel room.  Lisa Roxanne was very accommodating for our group of 2 adults and 4 children, even provided extra air mattress.  Would definitely stay again.[QWERTY123]I quickly felt at home in Lisa Roxanne's home. The top floor is part of the house but I always felt that I had privacy and could get on with what I had to do. Anything that I felt missing in the kitchen was quickly organised as soon as I asked for it. Lisa responds extremely quickly to any message on AirBnb and helps with the issues that comes up. She did call me a car service this morning for me to go to JFK. Very helpful!
The area is up and coming and has good restaurants and a nice vibe. I would live there again without hesitation.
[QWERTY123]We enjoyed our brief stay. Lisa was wonderful, answering messages and accomodating our arrival even when we were several hours later than anticipated. We would definitely stay here again[QWERTY123]We enjoyed staying at Lisa Roxanne's place. The place was spacious, clean, and easy to find. Lisa Roxanne was extremely accommodating, allowing us to store our bags before check-in time. The bed was very comfortable. It was a very good experience all around.[QWERTY123]Arrived Dec 24th around 4:30pm which we had just finished visiting the Jehovahs Witnesses Head Quarters. The location to the Airbnb was very easy to find as well as the parking which is on Gates ave. Lisa was a very kind and hospitable person she greeted us at the door and showed us to our room as well as gave us directions to the nearest subway (G On Lafayette and Classon Abe) and restaurants which are really close walking distance even. The accommodation was perfect 2 beds and a comfy cot which fit 3 people in the top floor of the 3 story brownstone, there was a kitchen which included a stove, microwave and refrigerator as well as a dining table to sit and eat. The bathroom was very clean and Lisa provide us with towels, toothbrushes and toothpaste as well as soap and shampoo in the shower which was very thoughtful. The neighborhood was fairly quiet and safe. If the subway is not your thing there are city bikes a few blocks up on Lexington ave. Overall we are deeply appreciative of Lisa's hospitality, we would totally recommend this place and we hope you have a wonderful stay. Thank you.[QWERTY123]This was my first time using Airbnb and we had a wonderful time staying with Lisa! The neighborhood was as described and I never felt unsafe walking around at anytime. Lisa also gave us a guidebook of restaurants and bars to try in the area that proved to be very helpful. We met new people at most of the places we went to. Manhattan is about a 40 minute subway ride so plan for that if you do decide to stay here.[QWERTY123]The location is great, 6 blocks to two different subway stops/trains that's less than 30 mins to Manhattan. Neighborhood is pretty quiet and many places being updated in the area. I was a little apprehensive about the arrangement of sharing a house but the layout of the house is such it's not an issue. This is a great value with the kitchen. Lisa made sure we had directions from the airport, which were perfect. I'd recommend staying here.[QWERTY123]Had a wonderful time, very cosy and warm compared to the freezing temperatures outside. The host even baked us an amazing red velvet style cake with a picture of us printed on, such a shame we weren't able to finish it. 

Great and simple connections into Manhattan, and even better into Brooklyn and Williamsburg.

Roxanne was lovely, assisted us in directions from Airport and into New York, and she gave us a great time at our flat. Go for it![QWERTY123]This good spot is accurately described by a wonderful host. We found ourselves hosted in the heart of the Brooklyn scene with easy access to everything-- great restaurants, public transit, etc.  The space was bright, spotless, and can work for a quick overnight or a longer stay too-- really a nice, peaceful discovery in a bustling and hip corner of New York.[QWERTY123]My boyfriend and I stayed at LisaRoxanne's place while visiting Brooklyn for the weekend. We had a very nice time. The apartment is clean and we enjoyed the privacy of upstairs. Parking was easy. We walked to to subway a few blocks away and checked out some nice places in walking distance. LisaRoxanne was a great host and was always available by text if we needed anything. Would definitely consider coming back in the future :)[QWERTY123]LisaRoxanne and her husband were great hosts! Very accommodating, and the apartment is located in a great part of town. Thank you so much for having us![QWERTY123]I had a relaxed stay at LisaRoxanne place which is what I was looking for. It was easy an easy commute to Manhattan. The area feeled safe. Thanks for letting me stay there.[QWERTY123]The apartment was just as described, clean, private, and very peaceful! This family is super friendly, offered to help with directions, and made sure I was alright during the blizzard! Highly recommend :)[QWERTY123]Great host!  Great place and plenty of space. Will come back for sure.[QWERTY123]LisaRox was a fantastic host and both her and her husband were very accommodating. My friend and I arrived late (after midnight) due to unforeseen circumstances, but they were still very welcoming. LisaRox was a wonderful person to talk to, and she helped us find what we were looking for in New York.[QWERTY123]Estuvo todo perfecto! El barrio es muy lindo, seguro, con un acceso fácil a todos lados gracias al subway y el alojamiento es muy amplio y cómodo! Estuvimos solo un día, pero Roxanne se preocupó por saber siempre como estabamos. Muy recomendable![QWERTY123]I was made very welcome and the accommodation, comprising the whole top floor (kitchen, bathroom & bedroom), was nice & private.  The bathroom & kitchen were very well-equipped.  The neighborhood had a great bohemian feel - my exact impression of what Brooklyn would be like.  Great bar, restaurant and convenience store a few minutes walk away.[QWERTY123]The place is small but the room was spacious enough for the three of us. It was also good to have enough space in the kitchen to cook and sit down to eat - we cooked a few times during our stay and the kitchen was simple but had the necessary utensils. Lisa was really helpful during the whole stay, with useful advice about public transport and even getting tickets for a Broadway show. It was overall a good experience![QWERTY123]My parents and I visited NYC for 9 days. Lisa was very helpful prior our visit and also during our stay. The place is clean and spacious for three people. And you get the whole 3rd floor for usage so privacy is not an issue at all. Location is convenient. Feel safe even when it's midnight. Recommend![QWERTY123]LisaRoxanne was very prompt to get in touch and was very flexible with my arrival time.  She was friendly, welcoming, and helpful with figuring out how to get to the airport on the subway. The apartment was spacious and comfortable and is located in a quiet and convenient  neighborhood.[QWERTY123]Super séjour à Brooklyn. L'appartement est bien décrit et très propre. Lisa Roxane à pensé à tout, même à un éventuel oubli de brosse à dents! C'est une hôte gentille, sympa et très disponible.
Pour les bons marcheurs, le quartier est proche de Manhattan par les ponts de Manhattan ou Brooklyn.
Very good trip at Brooklyn. Fit to the description the appartement is very clean. Lisa Roxane is a kind and helpful person.[QWERTY123]Brilliant host who made us feel welcome without being intrusive. Lisa had a good local knowledge of how to get around the city. The flat was basic but perfect for those who aren't too bothered about luxuries. The kitchen is well stocked with plenty of utensils. The neighbourhood is cool with lots of bars, restaurants and cafes and easy access to the subway. There are also Citibikes located nearby, which are a great way of getting around whilst keeping costs down.[QWERTY123]Lisa was very nice. The apartament was just like in the pictures, comfortable and clean. I would stay here again.[QWERTY123]This was my first time using Airbnb and it was a very pleasant experience! Lisa was a great host, with some wonderful food recommendations near her apartment. The apartment was nice and all necessities were provided. You share a common stairway with the rest of the house, but the top floor is very private and secluded. I would definitely recommend Lisa's place to anyone looking for a nice place to stay in NY. Look forward to staying again sometime![QWERTY123]Brilliant host, clean and comfortable apartment in a good location. Cake was great too![QWERTY123]This was my first Airbnb experience, and she was extremely helpful from day one. The room was extremely nice and she was willing to give us pointers on where to eat and how to get to some of the places we wanted to go. Definitely would recommend.[QWERTY123]i had a pleasant stay at Lisa's place. its very silent, comfortable and clean. it has easy access to many places.  Lisa gave me a cake for my bday. she is very open to questions and always ready to help.[QWERTY123]L'appartement est tel que décrit , propre et agréable. Pas très loin du métro , dans un quartier tranquille .
La chambre est assez spacieuse pour trois personnes, la cuisine fonctionnelle, la salle de bain également ( Lisa a même pensé aux brosses à dents!!)
Notre hôte, LisaRoxane a été charmante, discrète et accommodante pour notre départ tardif.nous avons pu laisser nos bagages et nous changer avant de prendre un taxi pour JFK.
Tout était très bien, nous avons passé un excellent sejour!
[QWERTY123]Quartier agréable,a 20mn de métro de manhattan,nécessaire de toilette avec le plus (brosse a dents). Bien juste pour dormir,pour 3,pour 4 un peux petit.[QWERTY123]Quartier très calme et agréable. L'appartement était conforme à la description avec une cuisine équipée pour se reposer des repas dehors. LisaRoxanne était très sympathique. Un petit effort de restauration vaudrait la peine pour valoriser cet appartement historique. Deux points à améliorer : le troisième lit pas confortable et la propreté générale défaillante.[QWERTY123]Dear LisaRoxanne, 
Thank you for your hospitality and your lovely cake. My daughter and I had a wonderful time in New York.  Hope to stay again at your place.[QWERTY123]Le logement est conforme aux photos et très agréable! LisaRoxanne et son mari sont adorables, le séjour d une nuit s est très bien passé![QWERTY123]We were 2 weeks to guest at Lisa Roxanne. We liked it very well. The apartment was as described. the access to the metro was very good. The quarter was safe and the people were very friendly. Supermarket and restaurants were near.
The apartment was very clean and there was coffee, coffee filter, iron and a hairdryer. Lisa Roxanne and her family are lovely people. She was very helpful and gave good tips. On our next visit to New York we will be happy to stay there again.
At birthday, there was a very great cake. it was a big surprise.
Lisa Roxanne and her family are great people.[QWERTY123]The floor is really nice, clean, very well located and has everything you need!   LisaRoxanne is very helpful, she really makes a lot for the guests and she is very flexible with the hours of arrival and departure.[QWERTY123]We stayed only for one night and are well rested before the flight. LisaRoxanne did everything to make us feel at home. Thanks for the hospitality![QWERTY123]We had a great stay here! We had all the amenities we needed. It was a warm week in New York, but there was a fan that we were able to use to keep the space cool. The neighborhood was very nice and it was an easy walk to some great bakeries and the subway.[QWERTY123]This place is fantastic, LisaRoxanne was an exceptional host and was very helpful with providing information including directions and recommendations for restaurants.  The private floor is essentially it's own apartment with all of the amenities you need, the neighborhood is lovely and quiet and has great restaurants and is close enough to public transportation to make everything pretty accessible.  We had a great stay and would definitely return![QWERTY123]Lisa Roxanne nous a très bien reçus. Elle est très serviable et a pris le temps de nous expliquer comment aller à Manhattan. Elle nous a même imprimé des itinéraires. Il faut compter 30 à 40 minutes pour rejoindre Manhattan. Le métro est à 10 min. à pied du logement. Le quartier où se situe le logement est agréable, de très belles maisons dans le coin.[QWERTY123]We felt welcome and treated well. Neighbourhood is listed officially not very safe but we didn't have any issues with people on the streets. It's quite relaxed family oriented area, churches and schools around.
The apartment has everything one would need from such place to rent.
The bed was really comfy, even better than in most of the hotels we have ever stayed and let's face it that is the most important part.

Our discomfort was the smell of cigarettes that came up from downstairs and that the floor is only separated by stairs so the noise of the kids and constantly ongoing TV feels very present and not private at all as it makes you feel that your average activities are just as audible for your hosts as they are for you. Not romantic at all if you know what I mean...
In over all it was a good stay but only recommend it if you want to be out most of the time and you need a place that has absolutely everything for the short time you spend there in the evenings and mornings. 
4 stars from me.[QWERTY123]We had a good time staying at LisaRoxanne's place. We didn't spend too much time in the apartment but the stay was pleasant. She was very good at communicating and even set up the rollaway bed for my friend. The apartment is just as pictured and has all the amenities that you'll need.[QWERTY123]LisaRoxanne was at home when we arrived and helped us with everything, including infomation to the neighborhood. The house is in a quiet street close to the subway and right next to a bus stop.
Our room (with a/c) with private bathroom (towels, toothpaste, shampoo.. was provided) and kitchen was upstairs. But if you are able (like us) to walk some steps it is the perfect place to stay. 
Since part of the subway was under construction during our stay, we sometimes took the bus to a bigger subway station (Jay or Hoyt).
Lisa Roxanne provided us the most beautiful birthday cake with pictures of the skyline of Manhanttan. Thanks again.
LisaRoxanne can organize transprotation from and to the airport. We didn't need it this time, but this can be very helpful.[QWERTY123]Accoglienza buona, le foto promettevano qualcosa di meglio. Molto  carino il quartiere e ben collegato.[QWERTY123]Logement satisfaisant pour decouvrir New York sans se ruiner
Proprio sympa et serviable - Ligne de metro directe vers Manhattan
[QWERTY123]Great stay at Liz's apartment. The place was clean, quiet and full equipped. Liz is a wonderful host communicating and checking if her guests are having a good time. Will come back for sure. Thanks![QWERTY123]Great place in an authentic and fun NYC-neighborhood. Public transportation is easily accessible. Definitely recommend it![QWERTY123]Lisa nous attendait et m'avez indiqué les directions dans le Air train. Le quartier est accessible très facilement. Il est sympa. On s' y sent bien. Loin de l'agitation de Manhattan, et proche par le métro, tout au plus 30mn. Nous avons découvert cette ville Extraordinaire qu'est New-York, également à travers ce quartier de Brooklyn.[QWERTY123]La padrona di casa è stata precisissimo nelle comunicazioni e veloce nelle risposte (l unico ritardo è stato causato da un problema con l app per cui io non vedevo le risposte). Lisa è sempre stata disponibile a darci informazioni e verso le nostre esigenze. L alloggio è funzionale e pulito. Si accede attraverso una scala un Po stretta,(se si hanno problemi di mobilita potrebbe essere un problema) ma noi non abbiamo avuto problemi. Il  bagno è nuovo appena ristrutturato. La cucina è funzionante con l occorrente per preparare un semplice pasto. I letti sono comodi e le stanze abbastanza grandi dove mettere le valigie e i vestiti. Lenzuola e asciugamani puliti e in ottimo stato.Per correttezza di recensione senza nulla togliere l'alloggio, nelle foto sembra migliore con rifiniture più accurate, ma ripeto pulito e funzionale. L aria condizionata funziona a dovere e il WI FI  funzionale benissimo. Il quartiere sembra un Po trascurato, ma sembra sicuro,noi siamo rientrati anche a tarda sera senza mai avere sensazioni di pericolo o insicurezza. Nelle vicinanze sulla Franklin vi sono supermercati, negli isolati adiacenti vi sono piccoli negoziati aperti fino a tardi. La metropolitana si trova a 10 minuti. Nei dintorni vi sono diverse linee di bus. Ringraziamo Lisa per l ospitalità. Ci torneremo e lo consiglierei ad amici che vogliano visitare NY senza spendere una fortuna consapevoli di non essere in un hotel a 4 stelle. Consigliato[QWERTY123]Nice place with access to Metro bus within feet of the front door. Friendly neighborhood with plenty of places to eat or shop within walking distance.[QWERTY123]Everything went perfect. Good room, good WiFi, no problems or anything to complain about at all.[QWERTY123]LisaRoxanne was very accommodating. We like being in a non-tourist neighborhood and this fit the bill.  Glad there is an air conditioner in the bedroom![QWERTY123]Close to subway in leafy street.[QWERTY123]LisaRoxanne met us when we arrived and gave us our keys - she showed us around and then let us be, which was just great. LisaRoxanne gave us privacy and we came & went as we pleased. The neighbourhood is great with lots of local food options - however it is on the flight path & the buses make it a bit noisy. We also hadn't realised that the trip in/out of Manhatten each day was fairly time consuming - in essence it gave us a great opportunity to see 'normal' life & we would never have gone to Brooklyn otherwise - which we really enjoyed - however as 'tourists' it was a trek in/out of the city

The accommodation was perfectly adequate for what we needed - good amenities - lisaRoxanne even thought to leave us a couple of umbrellas which was well appreciated - eating in would have been really easy but with NYC on the doorstep, why would you? 

Thanks & goodluck LisaRoxanne[QWERTY123]Alles war supersauber und nett hergerichtet. Die Nachbarschaft ist gemischt, teilweise chic, teilweise weniger, aber nicht unsicher. Perfekte Lage zur U-Bahn ca. 5 Min. Guter Bäcker azf dem Weg dorthin.[QWERTY123]We had a great stay at LisaRoxanne's place when we stayed for 3 nights in October. The apartment is relatively well located for the subway (less than 10 mins walk) and was equipped as shown in the pictures. Short walk to a few coffee shops/restaurants/bars. The living area had a good wifi connection, the bed was big and comfy and the bedroom was very spacious with A/C.  The only thing to bear in mind, as another reviewer has noted, is that even though the guest area occupies the whole of the top floor of the building there is no dividing wall or door for the area - other than the bedroom door.  This doesn't cause any major problems but it does mean that noise from the family living area below travels up the stairs more easily and has a feeling of the area not being completely private - although this was just a feeling as we had sole use of the top floor. LisaRoxanne was a friendly and responsive host before and during our stay.[QWERTY123]Super great location for our needs
The space was wide open and offered everything we needed would stay again[QWERTY123]Lisa was Awesome and her place was Great. We decided to spend a little time in New York and couldn't have asked for a better place. Lisa was kind enough to call us a taxi and recommend a play for us. She even took the time to find us some great priced tickets for a show. Her husband does Uber part time, so that is an extra convenience for you. 
Thank You Lisa for all you did and those homemade cookies were delicious!!![QWERTY123]Lisa's place is very nice and clean, the neighborhood is very quiet and the subway is really close. Lisa provides you with everything you need, toothbrush, bath towels etc. We didn't meet Lisa, but she helped us with everything we needed. We would definitely come back!![QWERTY123]My friend and I spent almost 2 weeks at LisaRoxanne's place and really enjoyed it. The bedroom and the kitchen are pretty spacious compared to other apartments and the bed is extremely comfortable. 
I only met LisaRoxanne twice and she was very easy to communicate with and nice. When we had questions we messaged her and she always responded very quickly. She even provided us with beach towels because we did not expect it to be so warm in October. A week later she helped us out with umbrellas.
All in all I would definitely stay at LisaRoxanne's again and recommend her to other New York travelers. We always felt safe and welcome.[QWERTY123]Stopped at Here for 5 nights, loved everything about the place.
LisaRoxanne gives you as much help with all things New York, as you need. 
I would stop hear again 100% 
Many thanks .[QWERTY123]Lisa was very helpful and kind. We had all we needed for the stay and she baked my daughter cake too.[QWERTY123]A good space, in need of some tender loving care
Lisa communicated brilliantly before the visit which was very helpful
The guides in room were good to have[QWERTY123]Great experience! LisaRoxanne is a wonderful, very sweet hostess, everything was as described. Easy commute to and from the city.[QWERTY123]My boyfriend and I loved staying with LisaRoxanne. Although, we were only there for one night we thought the flat was perfect and spacious. It is located in one of my favorite neighborhoods in Brooklyn, Clinton Hill. You have access to a full-kitchen, great bathroom and very comfortable bed. I could not have asked for a better stay. One of my best Airbnb spaces to-date![QWERTY123]We loved our stay at Lisa's, she was extreamely helpful, offered to drive my wife to her interview, helped move our car for street cleaning, saved us a parking spot. it was just more than a stay we felt like part of her extended family. Would definitely recommend Lisa's place if you are planning to stay around ny area. The place is very spacious, well lit, cozy and safe.[QWERTY123]LisaRoxanne is a warm and helpful host, and the apartment is clean and comfortable. The price is also very affordable. I would recommend this to anyone visiting Brooklyn.[QWERTY123]Lisa was very welcoming and accommodating[QWERTY123]Lisa Roxanne was a great and helpful host. We arrived after a 27 hour commute from Australia, she organised a car to pick us up and was very welcoming. She also gave us hints to get around NYC. She also gave us complete privacy. I recommend her home to other travellers.[QWERTY123]We loved the place, very clean and private, totally recommendable![QWERTY123]We really enjoyed our stay at Lisa Roxannes, when you first go in you realise it's the top floor inside her house you think it might not be too private but don't let this put you off, we didn't see anyone for nearly the full week that we where hear except sometimes hearing children playing but that didn't bother us. The neighbourhood is nice and there is an area of lots of shops and resteraunts in walking distance which towards the end of our trip we preferred to Manhattan. To go into the city is really easy by Train.[QWERTY123]Wir haben sieben Tage bei Lisa Roxanne & ihrer Familie gewohnt. Wir haben uns dort sehr wohl gefühlt. Die oberste Etage, mit Küche, Bad & Schlafzimmer hat man komplett für sich alleine & man kann kommen und gehen wie man möchte. Man bekommt zwar geräuschmäsig schon etwas von der Familie mit, allerdings hat uns in unserem Privatbereich nie jemand gestört. Zudem war bei unserer Ankunft alles sehr sauber. Zur Metro sind es nur wenige Gehminuten & von dort aus ist man in ca. 25 Minuten direkt in Manhattan. Wer also einen günstigen Aufenthalt in New York verbringen möchte & bereit ist auch ein bisschen zu fahren, für den ist es die perfekte Unterkunft.:-)[QWERTY123]Gute Lage. Sehr guter Preis. Wir konnten bei der An und Abreise noch in ihrem Wohnzimmer warten da wir zu früh waren. Sie hat uns eine schöne Übersicht gegeben mit der man sich gut zurechtfindet.[QWERTY123]LisaRoxanne was very nice and outgoing.  She is a very pleasant person and respected our privacy while we were there.[QWERTY123]Wir haben 8 Nächte in Lisas Unterkunft verbracht. Sie war immer sehr aufmerksam und zuvorkommend zu uns, hat mehrfach nachgefragt, ob alles in Ordnung ist und irgendetwas gebraucht wird. Zu Beginn erklärte sie uns die Umgebung und gab uns Tipps zum Einkaufen und für Bars/Cafés in Brooklyn. Fußläufig sind verschiedene U-Bahn-Stationen gut erreichbar, die nach Manhattan führen.

Da sich die Unterkunft in der obersten Etage des Einfamilienhauses befindet, hat man seinen eigenen Bereich mit Schlafzimmer, Bad und Küche, bekommt aber das Leben der Familie akustisch mit. Man erreicht die oberste Etage über das normale Treppenhaus, es gibt keine ""eigene"" Tür, die den Bereich vom restlichen Wohnhaus trennt.
Bad, Küche und Schlafzimmer sind sehr sauber. Handtücher, Fön etc. stehen zur Verfügung, die Küche ist gut ausgestattet.
Für unsere Reise war die Unterkunft eine gute Wahl.[QWERTY123]Our stay in Brooklyn was comfortable and friendly. LisaRoxanne and her family warmly welcomed us and we had everything we needed including pancake mix and delicious coffee. We have a 3 year old son and he had his own twin bed with clean linens. She was flexible on the check in/check out times and reserved us a car to the airport. Great stay![QWERTY123]LisaRoxanne is a wonderful host and will go out of her way to make your stay memorable. The accomodation has all that you may need and the subway and shops are around 10 minutes away.[QWERTY123]The stay was awesome.  Lisa was very generous with tips and information to make the most out of our stay. The place is bigger than the pictures made it seem.  It was very clean and smelled freshly scrubbed.  It's close to the subway and a nice neighborhood[QWERTY123]The place was exactly as described, and great! Lisa was very helpful and communicative, and even let us check in early after a red eye flight into NYC. Well located to explore many neighborhoods of Brooklyn and get to Manhattan and Queens.[QWERTY123]We stayed at Lisa home for almost three weeks and we had an amazing time. 
The kitchen and bathroom were brand new and fully equipped (she even left new toothbrushes for us!), the bedroom had three beds and we still were super comfortable. 
She received every package we sent, some of which arrived before us, with no complaints and changed our sheets and towels every week. 
There are kids in the house. We didn't care about the occasional noise but if it's something that bothers you, you maybe should take that into account. Overall we have absolutely no complaints! 
[QWERTY123]It is a nice stay. Lisa is very helpful. She recommends a good restaurant to us and print NBA match tickets for us. Highly recommend.

[QWERTY123]LisaRoxanne is a lovely person. However her listing description is not accurate. The set up is odd as it is actually inside their home. It is not a private apt/space and therefore should not be advertised as such. There is one key to the building's main entrance downstairs and that is it. The space does not have a front door you can lock when you leave for the day. You can hear the host family clearly as they are right down a few step (interior staircase).[QWERTY123]Great place to stay on a budget! LisaRoxanne was friendly and accommodating. Plenty of beds and overnight materials for up to 5 guests, but know it's one bedroom and one kitchen/bathroom area on the top floor of their home, so it's not exactly the most private place to stay, but we were absolutely given our space and could easily come and go as we wished.[QWERTY123]Our stay was absolutely perfect. We loved being in a fantastic area of Brooklyn. It was really easy to get into the city everyday. The apartment was spotless and we had our own little kitchen to make breakfast on a morning. LisaRoxanne was friendly and had helpfully printed us lots of useful travel instructions and local eateries. And it was easily the cheapest room available for miles! Thanks very much[QWERTY123]Perfect spot for us this long weekend. We didn't spend a lot of time in the apartment, but when we were there it was just fine! The bed is comfortable and all the linens were clean. There are some thin curtains that work for privacy and do block some night street light, but not all. The apartment was clean and had all the amenities we needed. It was very quiet and we didn't see anyone except when we checked in. Private enough for us. We heard people occasionally - the family has some kids - but it was just normal living noises. The check-in was flexible. The location is good in terms of being accessible to Brooklyn and Manhatten. It was easy to get anywhere by car (or transit). We were able to get to Prospect Park very easily and it is close to transit lines, although we didn't use transit as we had our dog. The neighbourhood was pretty quiet and felt safe. Close to Clinton Hill. Great to be dog friendly for us! Would stay again.[QWERTY123]LisaRoxanne's place was just what we needed after a long flight. Comfortable, clean, close to several restaurants.[QWERTY123]We stayed 4 days at LisaRoxanne's house and it was a very good time.
The rooms are in the second floor and we had our own kitchen so if you want you can cook something, there is everything you need for it :)
LisaRoxanne was very helpfull, also for buying tickets for the bus to travell to our next station. Of course we could here the family in the first floor but it was totally okay and not too loud. We definitly would come back if we are going to new york again :)[QWERTY123]This is a great place to stay in Brooklyn, with a very welcoming host and family who are very respectful of guests' privacy but also helpful and available as needed. Its terrific value accommodation and effectively comprises a one bedroom flat with a largish bedroom comfortably able to sleep 3 people, nice modenised bathroom and amply equipped kitchen. All this is located at the top of this family Brooklyn brownstone, which does mean using the same front door and staircase as the family but hey this is what airB'nB is all about isn't it? Once you're upstairs you are very much in your own space and self-containned, and the house is mercifully ( we went in late Feb/early March) very warm, and has constant hot water too.
This served us very well as a base for exploring Brooklyn and Manhattan in particular as the brownstone is close to 4 subway stations the nearest two being around 6-8 mins walk and the other two, 10 and 15 mins respectively.
Like most people we tended to go out after an early breakfast and spend the whole day and evening out coming back late to this rather quiet suburban area for a welcome relax and sleep.
All in all: excellent value, great location, terrific hostess well equipped accommodationwith everything you're likely to need for a great holiday in NYC: we stayed for a week and loved every minute![QWERTY123]LisaRoxanne was a warm and inviting host.  The home is really best for a couple or singles who don't mind sharing a room.  The price was reasonable for what was offered, and it was an easy place from which to get around.
Thanks LisaRoxanne![QWERTY123]Stayed here for 5 nights in early March with 2 friends. For 3 people who were out and about exploring as much as possible this was a perfect home base to rest up and get back out to the sight seeing.[QWERTY123]Lisa was great! Arranged local car service from and to JFK for us. Had some easy chats during our stay. The flat is nice and clean. The family has kids - but it was just normal living noises. The location is good and accessible to Brooklyn and Manhatten - it was easy to get anywhere by transit. Neighbourhood was quiet and felt safe. Some nice bars and restaurants in this area.[QWERTY123]LisaRoxanne was a wonderful host. She was super flexible with our check-in/out times and responsive to all our questions. The location is great--easy walk to several metro lines that get you all around town and into NYC in a reasonable amount of time. It was lovely to come back to this quiet neighborhood after a day of bustle in the city. There are several sweet markets, cafes, and restaurants within walking distance as well. It was nice to have the whole third floor with a full kitchen so you can cook if you like. This was especially handy for breakfast and coffee.  You can hear their sweet kids playing downstairs. It's not intrusive--they really respected our privacy-and it's just normal happy family noise. It was a wonderful stay all around!  Thank you LisaRoxanne!![QWERTY123]Nice place to stay, away from hectic Manhattan. The house is old but the appartment itself is in een reasonable state. Bathroom and kitchen are well taken care of and functioning as they should. The beds are comfortabel and the tv is in working order. WiFi works proper. 
Going to Manhattan is really easy from several options. LisaRoxanne is totally prepared to help you with that. It takes a short subwaytrain to get there. 
When we come back to NYC in the future we would certainly choose for Brooklyn and wouldn't mind staying again at Gates 223! 
Thank you for hosting us,
Rob en Erna[QWERTY123]LisaRoxanne is a great host, that offers her place for a great New York experience. The neighborhood is quiet and friendly. Our suggestion: hop on the share bikes and explore the city - it takes you less than 20 minutes from Brooklyn to Manhattan.[QWERTY123]We had a nice stay. Lisa was verry helpfull with everything. 
A good place near subway, nice resteaurants an shops.

Evertthing worked just fine.[QWERTY123]Great place, very clean and cozy.kitchen is fully equipped. Would stay again![QWERTY123]We had a lovely time at Lisa's place. Our space was clean and well maintained. She provided a list of to-do, nearby restaurants, and train stations.  Oh, and the cookies were tasty.[QWERTY123]The place was very clean and accurate.  Bed was comfy. I didn't fully utilize the kitchen but I really could with the amount of kitchen ware that was provided. Very clean neighborhood. Overall it was great.[QWERTY123]Nice neighborhood , close to vegetarian vegan gluten free restaurant , near subway.
However there are 30+ steps to climb to get to the third floor where you will be staying.[QWERTY123]Roxanne's top floor of her brownstone is a perfect way to stay in New York without the HUGE expense of Manhattan prices.  6 blocks from the subway was great.  The leafy street and surrounding area was lovely to walk through each day.  Restaurants and food markets close by to either eat at or buy supplies to eat in.  We would recommend anyone to stay there.  Great kitchen, bathroom is good and the bed extra comfy.  Being on the top floor we didn't hear a lot of passing traffic. Highly recommend this Airbnb. Amanda[QWERTY123]Gutes Preis Leistungsverhältnis, Bahn (nach Manhattan) gut 10 Minuten zu Fuß, Bus (Brooklyn) direkt vor der Haustür. Wohnung 2. Etage, recht hellhörig, keine abgetrennten Stockwerke (Schlafzimmer hat aber Tür).[QWERTY123]Lisa es una excelente anfitriona. Nos dio indcaciones exactas para que pudieramos conocer Brooklyn. Muy respetuosa de nuestro espacio, Agradable y siempre dispuesta a ayudar. El barrio es tranquilo y la casa esta ubicada a 5 cuadras del subte C que va a Manhattan y cuyas estaciones tocan casi todos los puntos turisticos. Recomiwndo este alojamiento.[QWERTY123]LisaRoxanne's place is such a great location for staying in NYC! We were close to the subway and her street was relatively quiet compared to the high trafficked nearby areas. She was so helpful with our questions and was communicative regarding our inquiries! I would definitely recommend her place.[QWERTY123]We stayed with Lisa for 3.5 days in June for our anniversary. Upon arrival Lisa was very quick to get to the door and was in constant contact with us. The only thing that really was a concern for us was the smell of cats. My husband and I are both sensitive to cats and it finally caught up with us the last evening/morning of staying. The room was perfect for what we needed because we spent most of our time in the city. Only thing I wished the room had was a full length mirror so I could see my outfits better for our evenings. I would definitely recommend staying at Lisa's for any type of trip. She was a great host and evening got us a bottle of wine for our anniversary. Thanks Lisa[QWERTY123]Lisa est vraiment adorable et très serviable.[QWERTY123]This was my first AirBNB experience and honestly I don't expect to find anywhere else that gives such attention to the comfort of guests. If you're limited on luggage space you could walk in here with nothing but clothes - LisaRoxanne has thought of everything from toothbrushes to UK adaptors! The space is great and transport into Manhattan easy.  You can have privacy if you want it but they are such a nice family I can't think why you wouldn't want to interact. Her little boy Isiah (sorry if I got that wrong) is a real darling.  Can't recommend highly enough.[QWERTY123]Low-key, quiet residential neighborhood with equally low-key but excellent nearby cafés and restaurants, and if you need stores, the DeKalb-Bedford Avenue business district is a 10-15-minute walk. Six to 10-minute walk to the nearest subway lines (G, S, A and C trains), and a 12-minute walk + subway ride or 25-minute walk to downtown Brooklyn. LisaRoxanne is friendly and attentive. We appreciated her detailed recommendations on where to go for coffee and food. The apartment was clean, with a modern kitchen and bathroom and comfortable bed. If we need a place in Brooklyn again, we'll definitely be back.[QWERTY123]l'endroit est bien situé dans Brooklyn (commerces, restos,métro....), à 20 minute en métro de Manhattan .
Lisa est présente, communique bien,  est là quand on a besoin d'elle, et en même temps sait se faire discrète.
très bon rapport qualité prix, nous conseillons sans restrictions.
[QWERTY123]Agréable séjour à  NY, le logement est bien situé dans un quartier sûr
L’appartement est dans la même maison que Lisa mais suffisamment indépendant et Lisa est présente quand  on a besoin de quoi que ce soit. C’était un plaisir !
La climatisation est très agréable, il peut faire très chaud à new york
Le lit est confortable, la chambre assez grande pour tous les bagages, et la cuisine bien équipée
C’est un appartement que je recommande tout à fait , proche des transports publics, pas trop loin de JFK, et dans un quartier très pittoresque.[QWERTY123]Lixaroxanne nous a dépanné à deux reprises. Grâce à elle nous avons pu voyager en toute quiétude ! 
Elle reste discrète ce que nous avons personnellement apprécié !... l'appartement est simple mais suffisant pour quelques jours près de New York. 
Et avec internet vous pourrez trouver de bonnes adresses pour manger ou boire ( Donuts Dough  à deux pas et sont à tomber,d'ailleurs sont sur un Guide! )[QWERTY123]Lisa is a very nice host . I had a good day in her house.she told me the details of the  surrounding area and how to go to Chinatown ang time square.[QWERTY123]This was a great place to stay. Very New York brownstone in a nice street with full facilities except washing machine. Very much afamily home. Friendly neighborhood. Convenient to bus and train with access to all of New York. Really nice helpful host.[QWERTY123]Great value place in a lovely neighbourhood. Convenient to get to Manhattan, with decently comfy beds.[QWERTY123]Great place to stay. Nice neighbourhood with subway a short walk away. We really felt at home at LisaRoxanne's place. Very clean with comfy beds, well equipped kitchen and nice bathroom.[QWERTY123]Nos quedamos tres noches con mí mujer e hijo adolescente. La estancia fue buena, es en el tercer piso de una casa de familia con niños. Habitación con cama matrimonial y cama extra para nuestro hijo, la escalera comunica toda la casa y no es un departamento separado del resto de la misma. Para nosotros resultó muy bien, tiene todas las comodidades, baño y cocina privado y buena internet. Lo usamos solo para dormir a nuestra llegada de las visitas a la ciudad. Está a 600mts de una de las principales líneas de Subway y a 20' de Manhattan, lo que lo hace conveniente y práctico. Buen vecindario.
Roxanne que es muy amable nos ayudó con el traslado de llegada del aeropuerto JFK y con tips para nuestra salida via Newark.[QWERTY123]Had a great stay at Lisa's apartment! She was very accommodating and flexible with our timings which we really appreciated!

The location was great too, we really enjoyed our stay! :)[QWERTY123]LisaRoxanne's home was great, and she was extremely accommodating! We had a great time.[QWERTY123]It was great staying there with my family. The hostess was welcoming and hospitable the house was clean and well kept. I will definitely recommend staying here.[QWERTY123]There is enough space for three people. You can hear the noises of the family especially because there is no kitchen door. But this didn't bother us. 
Close to the metro and a supermarket. Lisa was very nice and helpful.
We would recommend this place :)[QWERTY123]Very cute ... Lisa is awesome ... just the stairs very steep for heavy suitcases ..[QWERTY123]This was perfect for our quick trip in the city. For the price the location was fantastic! Lisa was a great communicator all along and made special accommodations for our check in. We were most thankful and recommend![QWERTY123]I highly recommend staying here. Centrally located 30 minutes by Uber and your downtown. Cafes and bistros within blocks to walk to. She was very helpful in answering questions and offering suggestions.[QWERTY123]Ms. LisaRoxanne was a wonderful host! We arrived 2 hours early and she worked with us anyway! The space was more than adequate and comfortable. Clean and besides the regular sounds of Brooklyn very quiet! We were celebrating our honeymoon and Ms. LisaRoxxane congratulated us and had made us a heart shaped cupcake cake! She is very sweet and easy to talk to! Thank you so very much again! We had a great time![QWERTY123]Meet our needs: a bed to sleep in, a place to get washed up and an eat in kitchen. Great location to Barclays and close to Manhattan. I never got to meet LisaRoxanne personally we communicated via the app.[QWERTY123]Genial ubicación y hospitalidad. Cerca de la estación de subte Franklyn Av a Manhattan y muy lindo el barrio. Lisa una persona amable y que nos atendió siempre muy bien, estamos muy agradecidos!.[QWERTY123]Le logement est bien situé, il est facile de se rendre au métro (direct pour Manhattan) ou d'aller faire quelques courses. Le quartier est typique et agréable et Lisa Roxanne sympathique.
Toutefois, j'aurais quelques remarques à apporter: il faut savoir qu'il y a 3 enfants de moins de 10 ans dans la famille et que l'on entend tout ce qui se passe dans leur chambre dès 6h30 du matin / le lit d'appoint pour la 3ème personne (moi en l'occurrence) est juste un cauchemar pour le dos, partez donc à 2 ;-) / difficile de faire la cuisine car les casseroles sont dans un état lamentable (nous ne les avons pas utilisées du coup) / les sols étaient sales et collants à notre arrivée (je crois que les voyageurs s'enchaînent trop vite pour que l'hôte ait le temps de faire le ménage...
Voilà, ceci dit, nous avons évidemment adoré notre séjour, mais plus pour la proximité de NY que pour le confort du logement![QWERTY123]LisaRoxanne's place was perfect for our needs and she was excellent at accommodating our difficult schedule![QWERTY123]Great space in a nice neighborhood. Loved the character of the place and it’s beautiful staircase. We didn’t use the kitchen, but it was fully stocked and ready to go. Nice bathroom and huge bedroom with lots of light.[QWERTY123]LisaRoxanne is amazing host, she provided all information and it was very easy to find place and check in. Apartments located perfectly in Brooklyn, I prefer to walk instead of tacking a metro, so Brooklyn bridge and perfect views to Manhattan skyscrapers are just in 45 minutes of walk) also metro is very close, so there is no problem to get to the heart of NYC. Also LisaRoxanne gave nice recommendations where we can eat or spend evening.[QWERTY123]I had stayed here once before a little over a year ago and had a pleasant experience, and whenever I saw it was open when I was back in town I jumped at the chance because it's clean, comfortable, and conveniently located to the metro and local grocery stores. Safe neighborhood, free street parking- highly recommended to other travelers. Thanks again![QWERTY123]A good place to sleep after touring New York. Great neighborhood. Important to have your own well equipped kitchen. Just keep in mind that it is a family home, and the children get up early in the morning :). Good experience.[QWERTY123]This was my first time using an Airbnb, and I really enjoyed it! Lisa and her family were very welcoming and accommodating to our family, even with a baby and a dog. Her house is close enough to a subway stop, that we were able to go in/out of Manhattan easily and see what we wanted to see. The cake she made for us to celebrate my husband’s birthday was above and beyond. The accommodations were clean, comfortable, and she provided all the modern amenities that a hotel would provide. It was more like a home away from home. My family and I enjoyed our stay and would highly recommend Lisa as a host.[QWERTY123]Had a great time. Would definitely stay there again[QWERTY123]Great location. Cozy place. Wonderful host. Easy access to anywhere. Must go to Lucali if you do stay here.[QWERTY123]Thanks for all![QWERTY123]Alles wie beschrieben. Guter Ort für ein paar Tage. Ohne Stauraum für Wäsche und und Hängemöglichkeiten  für nasse Handtücher.[QWERTY123]Lisa’s apartment was perfect for our one night stay (for my husband, 9 month old baby, and me), and would have been great for a longer stay too, though we were in transit. 

We enjoyed the private floor at the top of Lisa’s busy, family home. The bedroom is spacious, the kitchen is fully equipped and the water is hot :) Lisa provided us with a comfy portable crib for our baby and we all slept well.

Lisa’s house is conveniently located to subways and Fulton St and lots of great eateries nearby.

If you’re traveling with heavy or much luggage, be prepared to carry it up two flights of stairs. No big deal. And plenty of space to store your things once you’re up there.

Would happily stay again! Thanks, Lisa.[QWERTY123]Lisa was a great host and was quick to respond with local suggestions! Highly recommended![QWERTY123]We stayed our last night at Lisa’s. It was very clean and spacious! She arranged an affordable car service for us in the morning to get to the airport which was super helpful. Definitely recommend![QWERTY123]Lisa was very warm towards us and her apartment and hospitality made us feel like we were going home instead of to an accommodation.
Everything that was needed during our stay was there and we didn’t have to ask Lisa for anything. Even when we did, eg. Towels or extra garbage bag, she was quick to respond.
The apartment was also conveniently located between 2 subways of different lines.
Lisa was also concerned about our arrival and often checked on us if we are okay. 
She also helped to coordinate our transfer to the airport for a reasonable price that we can’t possibly get with Uber.[QWERTY123]We didn't have the opportunity to meet LisaRoxanne in person but we were thrilled with our stay. She met and exceeded our needs. Quiet Brooklyn neighborhood that was easily accessible for Manhattan and Brooklyn sites. If you're looking for a good place nearby, we loved The Market.[QWERTY123]I can see why Lisa’s place is often booked; the location is great, and she is an accommodating host. You have everything you need, and if you don’t, just ask! Brooklyn is at your fingertips, and New York at arms length; live it up![QWERTY123]Great space, good location.[QWERTY123]Lisa Roxanne is a great host. She was very responsive and accommodating to our check-in. There is a lot of space on the upper floor and the bed was large and comfortable.[QWERTY123]The kitchen and bathroom were well-appointed and nice. The AirBnB space place was scrupulously clean and the bed was very comfortable. We also appreciated that she made us a special deal to reserve the place the night before to accommodate our early morning arrival because of our flight. She was a pleasant host and this is a great deal in Brooklyn.[QWERTY123]Loved our brief stay here. The unique space and the vibrant neighborhood give you a feel for Brooklyn. LisaRoxanne was a great host-very flexible and helpful. I wish we had more time in Brooklyn and would definitely return![QWERTY123]LisaRoxanne’s place is quiet and cozy on a beautiful block of Clinton Hill. We had to change our reservation arrival times because of scheduling conflict and she was totally flexible and accommodating. This is a great value.[QWERTY123]家の近くにﾊﾞｽが色々通っていて､地下鉄駅からも近いです｡水周りも綺麗で､旅行中でも朝食や夕食を自分たちで用意できてﾘﾗｯｸｽできました｡ﾘｻさんも心のこもった対応をしてくれます｡また利用したいです｡[QWERTY123]We had a great stay and look forward to our next stay. LisaRoxanne was very helpful and accommodating.[QWERTY123]Easy going, clean and comfortable, great value.[QWERTY123]This place is not accurately represented by the photos and description, it is much smaller and more cramped, noisy and dingy appearing, and open to the landing where the family lives on the floor below.[QWERTY123]We stayed at LisaRoxanne's spot for one night. It was great for us. We explored the neighborhood and hit up some interesting bars. There was plenty of street parking and the room was clean and comfortable with a private bath and kitchen.[QWERTY123]I had a great time at Lisa’s place really relaxing. Definitely would recommend to all[QWERTY123]Lisa and family were accommodating, helpful and flexible with checkin and checkout.  I didn’t need much but Lisa was prepared for everything!  She really does have a nice little suite setup for guests complete with a fully stocked kitchen and appliances!  And the bed was divine :) we slept like a dream.  Thanks again, Lisa![QWERTY123]Nice space! Excellent suite layout with a nice kitchen with all one needs. Very clean and welcoming. Easy walk to the A/C line subway.[QWERTY123]We didn't have much time to spend inside the apartment but LisaRoxanne was easy to deal with and the apartment served our purposes very well.  Convenient location, short walk to the C train if you're heading into Manhattan, nice cafes & bars near by. Good stay at a reasonable price![QWERTY123]Lisa Roxanne es una excelente anfitriona. Nos consiguió el traslado desde el aeropuerto hasta su departamento, nos permitió dejar las valijas en  su casa el día que nos ibamos ya que nuestro vuelo salía a a la noche y nos dejo una copia de las llave para poder ingresar. 

Si bien el departamento estaba bien ubicado, limpio y tenía lo necesario para la estadía (por ejemplo: toallas, cepillo de dientes, artículos de tocador, entre otros); hay que tener en cuenta que Lisa tiene niños pequeños y puede llegar a ser un poco ruidoso. 

En resumen, lo recomiendo para las personas que quieran visitar Nueva York a precios accesibles.[QWERTY123]This brownstone was perfect for what we needed it for. Short walk to Barclays and shops/restaurants. LisaRoxanne was a great host and always answered my questions in a timely manner. Ample parking was also available on the street which was a plus![QWERTY123]Excellently placed for communting into Manhattan, we used RoxAnne's house as a base for just two nights. Short walk to Franklin Ave subway on the C line, with nice coffee house on route, the Daily Press, and a late opening corner shop half way from the subway back to Gates Ave. Comfy beds, well equiped kitchen and lovely host - although we didn't see much of her.[QWERTY123]Lisa is nice and receptive, I love the place, the only thing is that sometimes can be a little noisy, everything else great, I really recommend this place[QWERTY123]Thank you for your warm welcome, Lisa. 
You were very kind to us even I changed the check-in time. 
You also prepared everything for me. Thank you! I really enjoyed my stay.[QWERTY123]Lisa es muy amable está siempre atenta a colaborar y resolver cualquier inquietud, se esmera por hacer la estancia muy cómoda, facilita información que permite movilizarnos, la casa está muy cerca de diferentes vías para conocer la ciudad. La recomiendo mucho para ir con la familia[QWERTY123]The apartment is a great location, you can get to so much in lower Brooklyn. We were driving and parking was easy and walking in the neighborhood, you have a lot of different foods/places to try. We really enjoyed our stay with LisaRoxanne![QWERTY123]Lisa Roxanne was a great host and very accommodating.  Great communication as we asked many questions before coming, and she responded quickly to each.  She provided some great recommendations on places in the area and directions on how to get around.  There was plenty of space for the 3 of us and having the updated kitchen was very convenient.  The location is great, a few blocks from various subways.  The lines going in and out of manhattan were frequent and straightforward. Overall, a great place to stay.[QWERTY123]Great value for New York. Nice neighborhood.[QWERTY123]Wonderful host , so kind and helpful with lots of tips about where to go and how to get there[QWERTY123]This place was great. Very clean and enjoyable and a close walk to public transportation.[QWERTY123]The location is great, and this is probably the best feature of this place. The only issue we had is that the guest room is the third floor of the family home and all the noise carries up the stairs. Even with the door closed it was quite loud.[QWERTY123]LisaRoxanne’s place was great. It was super easy to get to am located by plenty of things to do.[QWERTY123]LisaRoxanne's place is very clean with great air flow. I enjoyed the breeze immensely. There is a lot of space to stretch out and the kitchen is well appointed. You cannot go wrong with the value of her home.[QWERTY123]Die auf den ersten Blick einfach eingerichtete Wohnung bietet alles was man für das tägliche Leben braucht, und in manchen Punkten sogar noch ein bisschen mehr. Die Küche ist mit Gasherd, Backofen, Toaster, Mikrowelle und einer Kühl-/Gefrierkombi gut ausgestattet. Die Betten waren bequem und der Geräuschpegel überraschend gering. Die Fenster isolieren nicht viele Geräusche, da die Wohnung aber in einem ruhigen und unserem Eindruck nach friedlichem Viertel liegt war das kein Problem. Das rund 7Mbit schnelle WLAN funktionierte Problemlos, LisaRoxanne war durchgehend gut zu erreichen und hat alle Fragen gerne beantwortet. Beim Check-In und Out sowie beim Verlassen und Betreten des Hauses zwischendurch gab es keine Probleme. Auch die Anbindung an die Subway ist gut, bis zur Clinton Washington Av, von der man ohne Umsteigen zu vielen Sehenswürdigkeiten in Manhattan kommt, ist nur knapp 15 Minuten entfernt. An der Station gibt es auch einen gut sortierten Supermarkt. Wir können die Wohnung jedem Empfehlen, der kein fünf-Sterne Hotel sondern eine einfache aber gut ausgestattete Wohnung sucht.[QWERTY123]Basic accommodations with full kitchen.[QWERTY123]Lovely host in good neighborhood.[QWERTY123]LisaRoxanne  accommodation is close enough for all attractions as the metro train station is a 5 minute walk away. The accommodation 
itself has everything you need and LisaRoxanne is at hand if you have any question. Will definitely use her accommodation if I visit New York again[QWERTY123]Great location and an amazing host![QWERTY123]Great space and location! We enjoyed our stay and would definitely stay here again![QWERTY123]Très bon séjour de trois semaines à NYC. Le logement est fonctionnel, nous disposons de l'étage pour nous. Le quartier est sympa, l'endroit est bien situé par rapport aux commerces et Manhattan. LisaRoxanne vous réservera un excellent accueil. Elle vous dépannera si vous avez besoin, et saura rester discrète.
très bon rapport qualité/prix.[QWERTY123]Muy buen lugar![QWERTY123]We had an awesome stay, the place is roomy and well appointed. It’s an easy walk to the local subway and a good supermarket is close. LisaRoxanne is a fab host, very fast to reply to any questions we had and very accommodating.[QWERTY123]















[QWERTY123]Super appart pour des jeunes voulant visiter New-York ! emplacement proche des métros et supérettes et dans un quartier sécurisé 
[QWERTY123]Lisa is amazing women and her husband too! Both are friendly and nice, Lisa is helpful in every point you need! We really like this home Very much and highly recommend. Thanks for everything ;-)[QWERTY123]Roxanne est très accueillante et
réactive. Pour nous le logement n’était pas ce que nous en attendions et avons préféré partir[QWERTY123]Would definitely recommend! Great deal and great space! We will be back![QWERTY123]wow. what an amazing experience. I fell in love with Brooklyn.[QWERTY123]Das Apartment befindet sich im 2. Stock des Hauses. der oberste Stock steht komplett zur eigenen Verfügung. Die Küche ist komplett eingerichtet inklusive Kaffeemaschine (Filter und gemahlener Kaffee ist vorhanden), ein Toaster, Gewürze...
Das WLAN funktioniert einwandfrei und ist sehr schnell.
Die Unterkunft befindet sich an der direkten U-Bahn Linie A, die sowohl zum Flughafen JFK als auch nach Manhattan zum Port Authority Bus Terminal führt.
In der Umgebung gibt es sowohl einen Supermarkt, Diners etc.
LisaRoxanne ist eine sehr unkomplizierte Gastgeberin, die wir sehr empfehlen werden.
Wer eine luxuriöse Unterkunft sucht, ist vielleicht nicht richtig, aber für den Besuch von New York war sie für uns perfekt.[QWERTY123]Great place and location, it really gaves you the feeling that you live in Brooklyn. The subway is just a couple of blocks away so you can come and go to Manhattan. Thanks to that we get to know really great people, everyone is so nice and Lisa and her family are lovely and very helpful. Plus you have and really great store in the corner so you can shop your groceries if you don’t want to spend so much money in the city. Also for the vegan lovers there’s a cute little coffee shop nearby so you’ll enjoy it. Hopefully I’ll come back soon!![QWERTY123]The 3rd floor is for guests only. You have to pass the staircase with the private rooms of the family to get there. 
The bed was very comfortable. The kitchen has enough space to cook and sit at the same time. 
Lisa Roxanne did provide us a baby crib and a high chair - thanks again. 
The house is old and needs some renovations but Lisa Roxanne and her husband are at it.[QWERTY123]Eine gut gelegenes Quartier mit sehr nahem kleinem store fürs alltägliche und für 7,75 $ Nutzung der Bahn vom/zum JFK.... Tolles Preis-Leistungs-Verhältnis bei grenzwertiger, aber zur Stadt gehörende Lautstärke.[QWERTY123]I have stayed at several great Airbnb's and have never met anyone as nice and helpful as LisaRoxanne
Her brownstone is very nice and in a nice location close to a subway stop and lots of buses too
For the price you can't go wrong[QWERTY123]We had privacy - bedroom, bathroom and separate kitchen are all on the top floor. Place was clean, kitchen real good. Lisa gave us some tips as to public transport etc. We came earlier, no problem to arrange things at all. We were satisfied.[QWERTY123]A great place in a gorgeous neighborhood. Two subway stops, a couple of delis, a bakery and a pizzeria are within walking distance."	40.68513770564301	-73.95975749881096	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/3831	3	89.0	0.85
8	16338	"The host is very nice and caring. The room is a little bit small for a couple but the location is perfect. The neighborhood area also nice to walk around.[QWERTY123]I had a very pleasant stay (7 days) at Patricia's Fort Greene place.  She is very kind, helpful and accomodating, even offering me a free pass to the AMoNH.  I have no complaints whatsoever and highly recommend this room to anyone (I would disagree with the previous review with regard to size; I stayed by myself but strongly believe the room is large enough to accomodate couples with ease).  Great neighborhood and great stay![QWERTY123]Patricia's room is very comfortable, on a gorgeous block in an amazing neighborhood and I was happy to have a chance to stay there.[QWERTY123]Although I never met Patricia, we had a couple of phone calls exchanging all the information, that we needed from each other. She was very caring about my compfort and arrival. Her room was just fine and the attached back side terrace is a a small personal garden eden in the City.[QWERTY123]I had a very comfortable stay at Patricia's, comfortable bed and I enjoyed the private deck. I didn't meet Patricia in person but communication was good and friendly. Very sweet cat and dog![QWERTY123]Patricia place is really nice. And she manage everything really well even she isn't at home during my time there. The house is comfortable and very we'll located, next to the subway and in a nice neighbor with restaurants, park and a nice flea market. You can stay at Patricia's house and you will really enjoy your stay.[QWERTY123]I was very lucky to stay  4 weeks at Trish's lovely apartment. The room is very spacious, comfy and cosy. It's a little oasis close to Manhattan. The area is quiet, safe with beautiful old brownstone buildings and fabulous places to eat and shop. Trish is a perfect host. She is very reliable and was always helpful when I had questions. She gave me great tips for things to do in the area! It was a wonderful stay! I highly recommend it!!![QWERTY123]My stay in Patricias apartement was a succes, and I recommend it to others who need a safe and cosy place to stay while visiting Brooklyn. Patricia was very helpfull and both room and the nice deck was nice. I could use the kitchen and other facilities. The neighbourhood in Brooklyn was quiet and the adress easy to find.[QWERTY123]It was lovely staying at Pat's place. She's super friendly, caring and kind. The room was great with that sweet terrace. I just love this neighbourhood and would always stay with Pat again![QWERTY123]Fantastic room in awesome neighborhood with private balcony overlooking a quiet courtyard.  I came to New York for a very busy work week and this was a wonderful oasis in the city for when the day was done. Super close to the G and C train. Close to restaurants and groceries. Patricia was an awesome host. I would definitely come back next time I'm in town. My only regret is that I didn't have more time to hang out on the balcony.[QWERTY123]Patricia is the most amazing host! The room is so lovely and the outside deck great. One of the best airbnbs I've ever stayed in - would defnitely recommend![QWERTY123]This is a great room and was a perfect, convenient, and pleasant stay. Trish is great and accommodating. All positives.[QWERTY123]My couple day stay at Patricia's was the best. Located in one of my favorite neighborhoods of Brooklyn, the apartment is right down the street from the subway, and around many delicious restaurants. The room itself was incredible. So spacious, comfy, and if it had been a tad bit warmer out I would have fully enjoyed the patio. Patricia, herself, is absolutely lovely as well. I was barely around, but the times we did chat I fully enjoyed it. She made me feel welcome the entire time.[QWERTY123]The room was nice and quiet and we enjoyed our stay in Patricia's flat. She is considerate and respects her hosts' privacy while giving advices on the city.[QWERTY123]The reservation was canceled 105 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.[QWERTY123]Patricia a été très accueillante, très gentille et m'a aidé à trouver un appartement à New York (ce qui n'est pas chose facile !). Elle m'a tout de suite donné le double des clefs et je me suis très vite senti comme chez moi. Elle respecte l'intimité de ses hôtes et donne pleins de bons conseils.
L'appartement est très bien, la chambre est grande. Elle dispose d'un petit fauteuil et d'une petite commode pour ranger ses affaires. Patricia met à disposition un placard dans la cuisine et un étage dans le frigo. La terrasse est appréciable, le quartier vachement sympa et plutôt vivant (ça doit l'être encore plus en été). Manhattan est très facile d'accès, en moins de 20 minutes.[QWERTY123]II was my first experience to find a place in Airnbnb site and in NY as well. And I am so happy that I had a chance to stay in Patricia' place. She was so helpful, easy going and friendly. I was appreciated her advice to make my staying comfortable. I even had a great chance to enjoy some local events with her and her friends. Regarding the room and the area - I loved it. The area was very safe and queit. It was close to everything and just 2-3 stops by expess train to manhattan midtown. There were cool bars just near by, good supermarkets and the parks. The room was pretty comfortable and spacious. It is my best experience and I wish I could come to stay with Patricia again.[QWERTY123]I enjoyed the cozy and quiet room,
particularly the benefit of the privat deck,
in a flat with an authentic flair, 
placed in a friendly neighborhood,
with a very nice host.
I have had to feel fine there! 
[QWERTY123]I spent a few weeks at Patricia's, it was all good. The room was spacious, bigger than average in New York.  Easy walk to Dumbo and the other close neighbourhoods with loads of restaurants. Thanks! :)[QWERTY123]I stayed with Trish for two weeks in July and i must say it was great! The room was big and nicely decorated. There was a bed in the floor which i preferred and it was quite comfortable. The deck was nice but a little dusty, so i didn't spent to much time there, although i must say it is perfect in the morning for having breakfast. The shared bathroom and kitchen were clean. The kitchen has all you could need to cook and Trish left some space in the cupboards and fridge for me. Also she provided towels and left a big closet in the corridor for me to use. There is a fan in the room which was great for the hot summer nights.
The neighbourhood was quiet and i found the houses and buildings nearby charming, it's a nice place (not at all scary even at night) and the building is a 5 min walk from the subway and 25-30 min ride to manhattan. It is an old building without an elevator but you only need to go up one floor. There were some restaurants and grocery shops nearby.
Overall Trish was a great host! She was really nice with me during my stay. We didn't get to talk much because i was out a lot but when we did she was really helpful and easy to talk to. During my stay i lost the keys to the apartment which made me really nervous and she kindly gave me another set.
I would highly recomend staying with Trish![QWERTY123]I've enjoyed staying at Patricia. She is a kind, warm person, and she respects privacy at the same time. The room was nice and I loved being able to use the deck to the backyard with all the plants and trees. I stayed at the end of a warm summer and this place was cool and shady and enjoyable.
The location is great, close to the subway and restaurants.
[QWERTY123]Patricia has been a good host.Lots of information and very helpful.We didnt have so much time to spend together but everything was ok. In order to enjoy fully the apt withbits deck, summer time woukd be better. Neighborood very safe and super close to the local subway stop.[QWERTY123]A pleasure to have been a guest at Patricia's.

A lovely space, a gracious host and wonderful space to collect ones thoughts and be so close to the surrounding beauty that is finer Brooklyn.

Thank you Patricia

Christopher[QWERTY123]I had a fantastic stay at Patricia's and will be booking with her again next year. 
The apartment has a lot of character and the room had loads of space with a very powerful fan for those warm nights. 
The location is perfect being a 5-10 minute walk from the bars/pubs with great DJ's plus restaurants/diners and the best little grocery store I've ever been in!
Patricia was a great host and told me all the best places to go which made life nice and easy! She was very approachable and chatty but also gave me space.[QWERTY123]Great location, and a comfortable 'home away from home' that suited my needs quite well for the four months I spent living in New York.  Thanks![QWERTY123]I stayed with Patricia during a 6-week drama program in NYC. She was a lovely host - very helpful, communicative, flexible and welcoming. Two subway lines are walkable from her place (<10 min). Lots of great restaurants and bars walking distance, too. The neighborhood is safe - I always felt comfortable walking home from the subway at night. The place is on the older side. The private outdoor patio is a nice touch. There is no AC unit but Patricia provided two fans in the bedroom which was fine for most summer nights (it did get pretty warm sometimes though). If you are there for a longer stay, there is no laundry in the building but there is a laundromat approx 5 min walk away. If you're looking a simple, budget friendly place in brooklyn, this apt is a good deal![QWERTY123]Trish and her place are amazing. Trish was warm, friendly and very easygoing.  The room is much bigger than I expected, tastefully and helpfully furnished( there is now a real bed in the room which was a great surprise) it is quiet, green surroundings, and as the bedrooms are on opposite sides of the apartment we didn’t disturb each other with our different schedules. I would definitely stay here again.

9	16421	"Great location, really near Time Square and the subway;Mark is also really nice and helpful;the only downside for me was the too hot heating which couldn't be lowered.[QWERTY123]A pleasant tho small apartment, in an extremely convenient location. Mark was pleasant and a kind person,  but he did not appear to view letting a room to me as a business and I was a valued customer.  Rather, I felt I had to fit in with Marks life and routines and think it should have been around the other way.... 
The apartment has great garden area to have meals outside, but in the colder weather in the small iving area, there is nowhere to sit down to eat at a table. Not a huge problem I guess.  However, the breakfast as such was less than what I would have appreciated, being  offered onl7y muffins and jam and only herbal teas if one did not wish for coffee.  I think Mark needs to  provide at least another choice --healthy cereal and fruit if wished.  I purchased these for myself.  I appreciated having use of the kitchen and upon asking Mark was OK for me to watch the TV for news etc.  In view of the fact that there is only one bathroom it is important and would be more considerate if each person used the bathroom for a shorter period of time to allow for others to access it. Also, it Marks occasional flat mate is using the second bedroom he really should not book people to stay and then put them into his bedroom --  which is what happened to me; I not only felt that I was encroaching on his space, but it did not feel like a room I had paid over $100 per night for!  During this time Mark had to sleep on the floor in the living room and I did not enjoy having to walk past his makeshift bed with him on it, during the night,  scarcely covered by a sheet. This was the arrangement for five of my ten nights there....  All this got sorted and Mark was only too willing to hear my feedback on my stay.  Overall, I would rate value for money 5 out of ten.  Mark just needs to sharpen up his ""host role"" and put his ""renters"""" first...[QWERTY123]Mark was very hospitable. The weather was unusually hot and humid for NYC in June. Mark had an AC in the room. The area is very convenient. Close to subway station. Most major places from Greenwich Village to Central Park are only 20 minute walks from Mark's apartment. Thanks Mark. 
[QWERTY123]great location, really close to times square maybe 3 minutes walking from house to times square. Inside the house it's really cozy, perfect backyard and Mark was a great and helpful host to me. I would totally recommend this house to the other people who wants to have a great stay in NYC. Thanks a lot Mark.[QWERTY123]the location of Mark's apartment was great, and my husband and i really enjoyed the convenience to times square and broadway, though in the apartment we often felt like we were intruding. 

i am really saddened by some misunderstanding Mark had of us. about 2 months after our stay, i received a review from Mark implying that we stole his passport. this is a shock to me, and is the first time i am reading about the passport. if he truly believed i stole from him, he did not email me to check if i have it and i am also not sure if he made a police report or take any legal action against me. i feel really awful for being accused of stealing someone's passport. this accusation may come back to haunt me and my husband, and it's really unfair to us.[QWERTY123]Absolutely wonderful...I returned!  Thanks Mark for great hospitality.[QWERTY123]Mark is a very welcoming host.  He gives you your space while always being there when you need him.  Very clean and comfortable surroundings. Excellent location close to restaurants, bars and theatres.  I would stay again in a heartbeat.[QWERTY123]Mark was very accomadating.  We were able to come and go with ease throughout the week.  The location and price of this apartment is unbeatable![QWERTY123]The location and the apartment are great! Mark is an excellent host and we spent a very nice time in NYC. I absolutely recommend to stay at his place if you are planning a trip to this wonderful city.[QWERTY123]Mark is a friendly host and we had a great time in his place.[QWERTY123]We stay for four days at Mark's home and we found a great host and we really enjoied to speak with him and we hope to meet him again. The location of his house just two minutes walking to Times Square. We recommended this host to everyone who want to spent time in big Apple.[QWERTY123]Mark is an excellent host, a rich source of advice on shopping, sightseeing, or things to do, yet very unassuming. The accommodation is nice and clean and organized, with good storage available. The location is the best anyone can hope for. While here, you are pretty much in subway heaven, with clear shots to all of Manhattan and the outer boroughs. A GREAT value. Thank you.[QWERTY123]Mark's apartment is a great place to stay. Mark is a great host and made sure I had everything I needed. The apt is nicely decorated with great attention to detail. Comfortable bed. Great location-near Everything.[QWERTY123]Mark's apartment is more than excellent, he could not of made us feel any more welcome. The location is excellent, literally 10 mins walk to Time Square and all major subways. There are a lot of fine restaurants and bars in surrounding streets, specially 46th street. 
With all this vibrant life around you, you would expect its not quiet to relax after your busy day but Mark's apartment is perfect for this before making your next trip out. If you after a central location in Manhattan this is certainly the place to stay, I can highly recommend it and defiantly will be asking to stay again. Thanks Mark for your kind hospitality. -  Graham & Mike[QWERTY123]Mark was a great, accommodatng host, providing a clean room in a beautiful apt with exposed brick & a large patio & wonderfully decorated with panache.  And location, location, location!!!  Less than 5-10 minute walk from the 42nd St subway hub and the heart of Times Square.  Tons of any kind of cuisine, shops, pharmacies, banks & food carts in all directions right out the door!! 15 min. walk to Central Park. And on & on...If I could I'd be back tomorrow in a New York minute[QWERTY123]Arriving at Mark's is like arriving at your friend's, He's waiting for your arrival, He takes the time to make sure you have everything you need for your stay. The apartment is extremely comfortable and nicely decorated.
Then you discover all the very kind attentions he had for you everywhere in the apartment. You feel  really like home when arriving after a big day visiting, The weather wasn't friendly enough so that will could enjoy the quiet garden. We really had a great time and Mark is a remarquable host!
He can be sure we will come back![QWERTY123]Mark is very friendly and helpfull and a nice host. But unfortunately he must be because during our time his toilet does not work which had very unpleasant consequences for us so that we had  i.e. to go to Starbucks to use their restrooms. That was the inconvenience what we disliked most. Not so important: the place at a whole was a bit untidy.[QWERTY123]The host canceled my reservation 41 days before arrival.[QWERTY123]I stayed in Marks place with two friends for six nights and it was a really good experience. The location couldn't have been better. It is very close to the theater district and times square but amazingly enough it's at the same time a nice and quiet place. Around the corner on 9th ave you will find some nice restaurants and the subway is very close as well. Marks place is very nicely decorated with asian influences. There are two small bedrooms, one with a double bed and one with a single bed (since we're from holland (tall people) the double bed was a bit too short for my two friends). Mark is a very nice and welcoming person. He gave us a good tip for an excellent thai restaurant around the corner. I would recommend staying at this heaven in hells kitchen to everyone![QWERTY123]I am a seasoned Airbnb-er. I love using the site to travel. 
This summer I am experiencing NYC for an extended period of time. I am staying all over the city to get a feel for different neighborhoods. 
Staying at Mark's apartment was fantastic. He is the best host. 
I enjoy personal space, writing and quiet time; Mark gives you space, is not invasive, and is always available to answer questions. 
His recommendations of places to visit and eat are perfect. 
Mark and the location of his apartment are at the best for visiting anything in NYC. Their are Subway lines VERY close (visit Harlem or Downtown). However, most things you can walk to. 
As for the apt. WOW. I enjoy spaces that reflect the tenant takes care of their space. It shows pride of space and the home. Mark has great taste in art and a good eye for color schemes. By far, Mark has the nicest kitchen I've seen in NYC (I've visited NYC more than 15 times). It is clean, complimentary lighting and beautifully decorated. The bathroom is also very clean and well decorated. 
However, the pièce de resistance is the patio. Mark's outdoor space is one of the MOST desirable and coveted spaces to have in Manhattan. The amount of work Mark has taken into creating a personal sanctuary in the city, shows his devotion to having nice things. I loved waking up and enjoying my coffee and breakfast outside. It is very relaxing compared to what is just down the street (Times Square).
I love Mark's apartment. 
I plan on returning with my boyfriend and attending some Broadway shows later this year; I plan on returning to Mark's!
Thank you Mark for a wonderful NYC experience!![QWERTY123]Very well located, only 1.5 blocks away from Times Square. It is also very conviniently located from the Subway, only half a block from the line that takes you to JFK airport.
The appartment is nice, nothing fancy but has everything you need for a few days stay, including air conditioning. The room is small and basic but enough, and the bathroom is clean.
I had a great stay there![QWERTY123]Charming apartment; an oasis of beauty in the midst of the bustling, centrally located Hell's Kitchen/;Theater district.  Mark is a wonderful host -- friendly and helpful.  I was there in high summer and the apartment was comfortable and cool enough.  Garden is GREAT for sipping coffee and listening to all the sounds of the neighborhood.  I'll definitely contact airbnb and see if I can get the same apartment when I return to NYC![QWERTY123]Mark's place is the place to be if you want to be where the action is.  Conveniently located to sights and transportation.  Mark is a friendly chap and a kind hearted soul.  He'll look after your needs or let you fly solo.  His place is an oasis among the crowds.  I look forward to returning one day and highly recommend Mark's place when staying in New York City.

- Rex[QWERTY123]Apartment very clean & cosy,convenient location,Mark very helpful.[QWERTY123]It was great! Simply the best option, close to all the amazing places in NY City! Mark is awsom, really nice and helpful. It was a fantastic experience.[QWERTY123]Mark was an amazing host! Not only is his place an oasis in the city, but he's also an amazing person to meet! Thanks for your hospitality and I hope to connect with you the next time I'm in NYC=)[QWERTY123]Mark was very pleasant and helpful any help I needed he was more than willing to explain what and where to me.  I would stay with him again if I was lucky enough to go to New York.  Cheers[QWERTY123]Mark es un excelente anfitrión, buen chico, amable, siempre pendiente de que estés cómodo en su casa y dispuesto a resolver cualquier duda que puedas tener sobre la ciudad.
Es fácil compartir vivienda con él, su hogar es silencioso y tranquilo, tiene un jardin precioso.
Sin duda alguna pensamos volver a visitarlo cuando volvamos a Nueva York.
[QWERTY123]Perfectly located and a very nice host![QWERTY123]Mark's ""Heaven in hells kitchen"" truly lived up to it's name. The apartment was just right, clean, comfortable and convenient. Mark was the best host anyone could wish for. With his generosity, helpful advice and general pleasantness, he made us feel very much wanted and at home. And the location? Two minute walk to Times Square! Very safe neighborhood, close to the major transport hubs (subway, bus, train), so it's easy to move between the apartment and the airports in a short time, as well as getting to every corner of Manhattan.
To sum up: perfect location, perfect apartment, perfect host for a perfect stay in the most perfect city in the world![QWERTY123]Mark is a charming host, the apartment is clean and obviously well taken care of. You can't beat the location for easy access - from  Museum Mile and Central Park all the way down to Greenwich Village and Wall Street. Mark's place is an oasis in the chaos of midtown Manhattan. Can't wait to go back....[QWERTY123]I just keep coming back!  Mark is a delight to stay with...always accomodating yet never intrusive.  Heaven in Hell's KItchen is ALWAYS my first choice when visiting NYC.[QWERTY123]We had a great time at Mark’s during Thanksgiving week. Mark proved to be a interesting and considerate host.  Unfortunately we didn't see much of him as he decided to go home for Thanksgiving. We enjoyed having the apartment to ourselves but it was a little disappointing to not have a chance to get better acquainted with Mark. The apartment was great - clean and comfortable. His location is spectacular – two blocks from Times Square and there's cheap (relatively!) garage parking right across the street. A really good experience – we'll be back.[QWERTY123]i stay with Mark for 4 days the first week of December, my stayed in his apt overall was pleasuring , his apt is clean, organized and well located, just two blocks from time square. this was my first time using Airbnb i did felt little strange staying in someones place without knowing them. 
[QWERTY123]Mark was very welcoming. The apartment is very clean, tidy, and well-appointed. The location can't be beat: 4 minutes walk to Billy Elliot the Musical. Very little road noise in the apartment. Highly recommended![QWERTY123]My sweetheart and I had a fun stay there for four nites.
The room was quiet and Mark was a good host.
The location is quite close to Broadway, Central park and many stores.[QWERTY123]Mark is a great host and his garden deck is a big plus! Would not hesitate to stay there again. So easy to get around and a very pleasent experience.[QWERTY123]We had a great time in Mark's home.
When we arrived Mark show us how everything worked and we could do everything alone.
He also call us to know if we were good and need anything.

Thanks![QWERTY123]Had a wonderful (Email hidden by Airbnb) fortable, helpful, and right in the heart of it all!  :)[QWERTY123]Mark was totally flexable with our arrival & departure times and graciously welcomed us even though one of us arrived at 1am.
He was informative with directions, knowledgable of points of interest and a wow at restaurant choices.
His location is superb, he made his home our home and his garden IS HEAVEN in Hells Kitchen. We intend recommending him to our friends.
Thanks Mark, Helen and Ann
,[QWERTY123]Mark was an amazing host, he really did make our stay as comfortable as possible. His apartment was located in a perfect spot were you could easily access many places by subway or walking. He gave us very useful suggestions on where to eat, shop and what to see. Me and my sister had a great time at Marks place![QWERTY123]Mark is a great host!
We is a lovely person. We had a great time in NYC!
He was really kind and friendly with us.
Totally recommended!
[QWERTY123]Mark was an amazing host... Lovely place to  stay, best location in NYC, near everything a visitor needs. Thanks Mark for everything, I hope meeting you very soon. I felt like home. J'ai tout aimé, merci![QWERTY123]I have stayed in many other NYC neighborhoods and types of accommodation. This stay was among my most-pleasant and interesting. And considering what hotels are charging nearby, Heaven in Hell's Kitchen is great value.

For a theatre-goer like me, Mark's location cannot be beat. Almost all Broadway theatres are less than 10 minutes' walk away. The dining options on nearby 9th and 10th Aves. are outstanding. Proximity to subways (2 minute walk), Port Authority Bus Terminal, and Penn Station is excellent.

The apartment is very old, and that is part of its charm. If you only rent the single room, it is fairly dark as its window does look into an air shaft. If you pay a bit more and take the double room, you get lovely light. I slept in both rooms, and found both to be comfortable. Both rooms are about the same size, but since the double room has a larger bed, there isn't a lot of wiggle space. Mark makes some closet and drawer space available. My partner and struggled to juggle a ton of luggage in the tiny space but we managed. 

We were lucky to have great weather, and took full advantage of the very pleasant deck. 

The kitchen was very well set up--had everything we needed for a bit of toast and coffee. 

It's important to remember that this is a person's home--it is NOT your dedicated apartment. Mark LIVES HERE. The space is full of his collected art, his books, and his style. If you're looking for someplace modern, private, and austere, look elsewhere.

Mark is a lovely host. We really enjoyed getting to know him, and loved staying with a real New Yorker for a few days. He was totally accommodating with our arrival and departure schedule, and overall helped make our NYC stay very easy and pleasant. 

Again, excellent value.



[QWERTY123]A lot of what others write about is true: great location as it is close to a major station and nearby broadway. Overall clean, tho the towels are worn out. We really appreciated the quick wifi too, and breakfast was simple but good to have!

It is decorated in Mark's unique style - the living room is moulin rouge red! We stayed in the room with a double bed. I couldn't tell if it was a sunny or cloudy day when I looked out the window from my side of the bed though. 

It's true the room is small -  but we expected it in New York. Because Mark is living there tho, I feel it would be too cramped to also rent out the other room to other guests as Mark mentions could be the case in his profile - three ppl really is the limit. 

Mark also ran his massage service while we were there but gave us ample notice. 

Thanks Mark!
[QWERTY123]A great location, and a really lovely patio in the middle of NYC.  We didn't see much of Mark, but he left us his cell phone# so we could contact him. His apartment was clean and tidy. I had asked by email for the use of both bedrooms, but only one  was  made available, which was a pity, because we were rhere during hot, humid weather. The air conditioner is very close to the bed, so not exactly easy to sleep  with it  blowing on you. During cooler weather, the room would have been fine.
I would return sometime, but not during a heatwave!  Mark is a gracious host,  very helpful, and discreet.[QWERTY123]Mark is a gracious host who goes out of his way to open his home to his guests. Beautiful garden and incredible location. Wonderful experience![QWERTY123]Mark is really nice, flexible about the check-in/out, nice appartment and really close to metro and Times Square![QWERTY123]We had a great time in the Mark's place. It's really in the heart of NYC and although quiet. Its really Heaven in Hells Kitchen ! It allowed us not spend too much time walking, and that was very convenient for me and my teenagers, as you can imagine !
The little terrace is lovely and very pleasant to use after a hard day in New York.
I have not met Mark but it was very easy to communicate. Marjory received us very kindly. Thank you ![QWERTY123]Mark and I corresponded via email and he was always very quick to reply.  His apartment is very comfortable and the location is just as advertised, just steps away from Times Square.  I can definitely recommend his accommodations.[QWERTY123]I feel lucky having stayed at Mark's place. The location is (more than) perfect and the apartment terrace is amazing to have breakfast every morning. I hardly saw him as he was away but he had made sure ahead of time that I would feel at home at his place. Great stay ![QWERTY123]L'appartement de Mark est idéalement situé pour permettre à ses invités de profiter au maximum de toutes les attractions de New York. De plus, il dispose d'une terrasse côté cour qui double sa surface et est très agréablement agencée, avec beaucoup de plantes vertes.
Mark est un hôte plaisant, courtois, serviable, et calme. Il est à votre disposition pour tout conseil pratique sur sa ville, mais sait aussi à l'inverse, vous laisser toute liberté de la découvrir seuls si tel est votre souhait. Bienvenue à Manahattan !!![QWERTY123]It was a great pleasure to meet Mark. He is very nice and sportsman. We ran with him along the Hudson river; It was a great moment. His home is very peaceful with a cute garden. Breakfast is good. his flat is located in the center of all NYC attractions in a very quiet district. We will not miss to come back again when we will back in big apple. 

[QWERTY123]We were very happy with our choice of B&B at Marks place. The location was fantastic, just a block away from Times Square.
Mark was an exellent host who gave us tips on what to see and do in the city. He was also very discrete and nice and we felt very welcome. We would recommend anyone to stay at his little oasis in the middle of the busy city.
Thank you again Mark!

Best regards
Kristin and Jocke from Sweden[QWERTY123]La situación es inmejorable y la zona tranquila. El patio es una zona de desahogo muy interesante.
Mark es muy cuidadoso con sus huespedes y trató de no hacer ruido y de hacer todo lo posible porque estuvieramos cómodos.
La casa resulta pequeña para  4 (tres huespedes y el anfitrión) a pesar de que Mark puso todo su interés porque estuvieramos bien. Si volvemos 2 adultos iríamos ahí, pero no con el niño.
En las fotos que vimos en airbnb nos hicimos a la idea de que eran dos camas en una habitación, pero no era así y  Mark se dio cuenta un par de días antes y buscó la solución.
La cocina  está muy bien, aunque el baño no está al mismo nivel.
Teniendo en cuenta la relación calidad - el precio la valoración es positiva.[QWERTY123]Mark was accommodating with our late arrival time, laid back and a great host.[QWERTY123]Mark est un très bon hôte. Nous sommes arrivés peu avant l'arrivée de Sandy pour une durée de 6 nuits. Ce fut très agréable de rester chez lui. Il a su nous rassurer durant l'ouragan et nous conseiller quand nous avions besoin. Bref notre première expérience avec airbmb est une belle réussite.[QWERTY123]During our stay at ""Heaven"", Mark's little oasis in mid-town Manhattan, we enjoyed his easy-going nature, including a very accommodating check-in, check-out arrangement, good conversation, sharing of some ""treats"" and trivia.  Though we came to participate in the NYC Marathon, we managed to enjoy the city despite the unfortunate but understandable cancellation of the event partly due to Mark's eager disposition to help us find the location of places we wanted to get to while there.  We found the location to be conveniently central to everywhere we wanted go.  We walked EVERYWHERE from Mark's place.  I DO hope to return to actually run the marathon next year and would LOVE to stay in ""Heaven"" once again!  Mark was an exquisite host.[QWERTY123]Mark is an excellent host; he is both unobtrusive and genuine.  The location is very central and certainly represents great value. Would definitely stay again![QWERTY123]Mark's apartment is clean and neat. It is really quiet at night since it is quite far from traffic. But the most important thing is that the place is really close to anything must see in New York: Broadway, Madison Square, Central Park and Penn Station. Subway station is just minutes walk. I really like the place! Moreover, Mark is very nice and ready to help with guidance and direction if you need it. I definitely will stay there again if I have a chance to get to NY again.... Ups, one more thing to note that Marks's neighbour is also very nice and helpful: when I leave the apartment with luggages that beyond my handling, one of Mark's neighbour that coincidently also leaving his apartment, greeted and offered some help to carry one of my luggages! It is really surprising for me....[QWERTY123]Great location close to everything! Very quiet cosy appartment that we had all to ourselves (3 personns). We shall come in the summertime to enjoy the beautiful back garden as well, that Mark has nicely put together, as well as the nice interior!
Great place + great price + nice host = we'll come back ![QWERTY123]Mark was a very friendly and pleasant host, and being able to come and go as we needed was very handy!!!

The place has a good location, and it was really nice to arrive in a warm place in the cold winter of new york city![QWERTY123]Très belle semaine, appartement idéalement situé et Mark est un hôte parfait, très serviable.
Je recommande et ne manquerais pas d'y séjourner de nouveau quand je retourne à NYC.[QWERTY123]Mark is a fantastic host and his flat is great also. Very close to theatres, Time Square, buses (Port Authority), subway a few meters. In addition, no noise at all. Many restaurants in the area for all meals. I highly recommend this flat. Thanks Mark for the great week in NYC.[QWERTY123]Mark is a very discrete, friendly and easy-going gentleman. The flat itself is cozy and clean. There was coffee in the morning and I was offered muffins and yoghurt for the morning.

I would have been better served knowing upfront about details to ease my stay by the host (location of lights, heat in the bathroom, wifi code - the wifi was spotty and luckily I had my own hotspot). The room I stayed in was serviceable - I was expecting a double bed and not a single trundle bed with a thin mattress which was barely long enough for someone 5'10"" and an uncovered throw cushion as a pillow. Also, I would suggest dedicating the room exclusively to paying guests instead of having personal items in the room and the closet almost full with personal belongings.

As another guess noted there is only an air conditioner for ventilation. It was uncomfortably hot (notorious for NY buildings with steam heat) and luckily I discovered (by myself) that I could open the window from the top of the unit which made it bearable. (Although I then had to contend with rutting pigeons in the breezeway - literally) Luckily, I had a pair of earplugs with me which of course is not practical when you need to hear an alarm to wake up.

The flat is quiet from outside noise but the one significant noise inside the apartment is a loud chime clock that rings on the hour (imagine the chimes between the hours of 4 and 12!) and once on the half hour. I understand that it is probably a quaint and charming piece but impractical for staying, paying guests who perhaps many have jet lag to contend with and won't be staying long enough to build up a ""resistance.""

Finally, I was surprised to read from another guest that Mark asked if she was going to be out because he had a massage client coming and he wanted to set up in the guest room. I imagined that I would be incredulous...and then he asked me as well! The client wound up canceling but nonetheless it was surprising.

Again, Mark is a charming and welcoming chap. I think with a few adjustments/details attended to it could be a nice alternative to a hotel.[QWERTY123][EN]
My experience was Wonderful!! If it's your first time or not in NYC, the Mark's home is a excellent choice!! The location is perfect. Easily to go wherever you want. Close to subway, Time Square and Port Authority.

I was surprised, because the house is much better than the photographs.

Mark is cool, commitment and great guy!

Sure I'll come back!

[PT]
Minha experiência foi Maravilhosa!!! Se é a sua primeira vez, ou não , em NY, a casa do Mark sem dúvidas é uma excelente escolha!!! A localização é perfeita. Desloca-se facilmente para onde desejar. Próximo ao Metrô, Time Square e Port Authority. 

Eu me surpreendi, porque a casa é muito melhor que nas fotografias.

Mark é agradável, solicito e sempre disposto a ajudar.

Eu recomendo!!![QWERTY123]Heaven in Hell's Kitchen is a great little place to stay.  The location is wonderful if you love the action of Times Square, but enjoy a quiet spot to crash! It's only a block away from the Metro and 7th Ave, where all the lights and people are.  Go A few more blocks in the opposite direction and you're enjoying the view of the Hudson River!  Lots of great shows and restaurants nearby. Mark is a pleasant host, quiet and unobtrusive, but helpful and kind. The place is small, but very comfortable.
I enjoyed my stay very much and have only one regret; that I did not invite Mark to lunch!
I recommend this listing.[QWERTY123]Mark was a wonderful host and was always able to help out with answers when we had questions on NYC. His apartment is in a perfect location, just a few blocks from Times Square and the room was cosy and comfortable. Look forward to staying again next time I'm in New York.[QWERTY123]Mark was an excellent, very helpful and a nice host. The location is optimal, close to Time Square, Broadway, subway, train and bus station and although in a quite district. The apartment has a small and beautiful garden.
Mark es una persona muy atenta, amable y simpática. El departamento está a unos pasos del Time Square, Broadway, y de la estación del metro, tren y bus. El departamento tiene un pequeño jardín, lo cual es difícil de imaginarse a unos pasos del Time Square. Los pocos momentos que lo vimos, ya que salíamos a hacer nuestros recorridos por NY a partir e las 9.00 a.m. y regresábamos a eso de las 9.00 p.m., tuvimos oportunidad de conversar con él y nos daba consejos de cosas para visitar que sólo los neoyorquinos conocen. El desayuno fue bueno.
Maks Wohnung liegt sehr zentral, einen Häuserblock vom Time Square entfern. Die SUBWAY-Station liegt nur zwei Minuten entfernt. Auch vom Flughafen ist man in 30 Minuten dort und braucht kein teueres Taxi. Das Zimmer ist zwar etwas klein, doch das ist in NY bei den dortigen Mieten so. Dafür ist es sehr sauber. Die Gegend ist sehr ruhig, Und Mark ist ein exzellenter Gastgeber, Sehr freundlich und hilfsbereit. Jeden Morgen war der Kaffee schon gekocht. Er gab auch eine Menge an Tipps. Wir können die Unterkunft jederzeit empfehlen und haben uns in den 6 Tagen sehr wohl gefühlt.
[QWERTY123]Nous remercions et recommandons vivement Mark. C'est un hôte accueillant, disponible et sympathique. Son appartement est idéalement situé et cela nous a permis de découvrir NYC en long, en large et en travers! Nous tenons sincèrement à le remercier pour tout et lui souhaitons plein de belles choses!
Aude & Raffaele[QWERTY123]Mark was a gracious host. He was considerate, welcome, and friendly. His place was clean and quiet. Would definitely recommend visitors to stay there![QWERTY123]It was our first time in NY and our first airbnb experience and we DEFINITLY recommand Mark's place : great and pleasant location, clean place and VERY friendly host. He did his best to let us enjoy our stay. With a little delay, thank you very much Mark. I hope we'll come back soon![QWERTY123]Wir hatten einen schönen Aufenthalt bei Marc. Er ist ein sehr netter Mensch, leider konnten wir uns nicht so gut unterhalten, wegen der fehlenden Sprachkenntnissen. Das Zimmer ist praktisch gelegen Nähe Bus-Terminal. Idealer für Single betreffend der Platzverhältnisse. Idyllischer Hofgarten mitten in der Grossstadt. Marc ist ein sehr freundlicher, diskreter Gastgeber immer bereit für Ratschläge und Auskünfte.
Wir danken Marc für alles und denken gerne an diese Zeit zurück.[QWERTY123]This is the 2nd time I have stayed with Mark-another great experience! I just love the deck in the back of the apt. and mark is such a great host. I wouldn't hesitate to stay there again.[QWERTY123]Perfect location, nice garden and great breakfast for a good price! Mark is considerate and friendly. You need to have the AC on in the summer if you live in the small bedroom as I did. The AC is noisy, but earplugs worked fine for me.[QWERTY123]We stayed at Mark's for one week and he was a pleasant and respectful host. It is in a great location very close to Time Square and therefore lots of subway lines. The apartment itself is very clean however in the mornings can be quite noisy with the window open which unfortunately is a necessity with the summer heat. The room we stayed in was quite small for two people as was the bathroom however there is a lovely terrace that you can utilise. As with a lot of NYC apartments the lighting is poor however the dark decor (mostly dark red) didn't help the situation- the photo is quite deceptive as the room is not as light as it appears. These were however only small disadvantages of the apartment.[QWERTY123]Mark's place is in the best location in the heart of midtown. Everything you need including great food, the subway and Times Square are only minutes away by foot. The place is a small apartment with a large outdoor area (the biggest room in the place!). Mark is friendly and welcoming and has a good knowledge of the local area. We stayed in the double room and space is tight, especially with 3 suitcases, but if you spend most of your time out of the apartment like we did this isn't a big deal and the location more than makes up for it.

The only issue we encountered was the place had been double booked. The second room in the apartment had been booked as well as our room for the first 2 nights of our stay, we were only made aware of this on arrival. This made things extra tight for the first couple of nights.

Aside from the double booking I would reccomend Mark's place to others.[QWERTY123]Après mon séjour chez Mark, j'ai décidé de ne plus aller à l'hôtel... Ce fut très agréable de rentrer chaque soir à ""la maison"", retrouver Mark et partagé avec lui les moments intéressants de la journée. L'accueil de Mark fut toujours chaleureux et discret à la fois ce que j'ai apprécié. Son appartement est décoré avec beaucoup de goût et la petite terrasse pour le petit déjeuner est inestimable. Merci Mark et à très bientôt, j'espère[QWERTY123]Es un piso con una ubicación perfecta: a 5 min andando de Times Square, a 15 de Central Park, a unos 20 del Empire State...Además, está al lado de la estación de autobuses de Port Authority, donde también está la boca de metro y a a la cual llegan los autobuses express de los aeropuertos, por ejemplo.
La casa está bien, tiene una terraza que le da ""vida"". No es demasiado espaciosa, pero suficiente, si la idea es pasar el día visitando la ciudad. Cuando nosotros hemos estado, había un poco de ruido de la calle por las mañanas, ya que tiene un parking al lado, y no sé si había alguna obra cercana. Pero bueno, nada que no puedan solucionar unos tapones.
Por otro lado, Mark incluyó el desayuno en el precio de la habitación, lo cual es de agradecer!
Mark es una persona muy agradable, siempre dispuesto a resolver cualquier duda sobre la ciudad.
Recomendaría totalmente la casa, sobre todo por la ubicación.[QWERTY123]The reservation was canceled 40 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.[QWERTY123]The reservation was canceled 34 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.[QWERTY123]OTTIMA SCELTA!!L'esperienza di NY è stata indimenticabile perchè la città è veramente pazzesca e grazie alla facilità di spostamento dovuta all'OTTIMA posizione della casa,il nostro soggiorno è stato reso ancora più godibile.Mark è un host discreto e assolutamente disponibile!Tutto è a portata di mano in casa e il giardino esterno conferisce quello spazio in più dove poter cenare o fare colazione(condizioni climatiche permettendo!)In 5minuti a piedi si raggiungono Time Square e la stazione della metropolitana nonchè i numerevoli teatri dove poter assistere ad uno degli splendidi musical in programma!In 10minuti(sempre a piedi) lasciandosi alle spalle Time Sq invece è possibile raggiungere l'Hudson dove poter prendere la Circle Line o dove si può affittare una bike....insomma la scelta è ottimale!!Grazie ancora Mark per la tua disponibilità e per la tua gioia nell'ospitare gente nuova di tutti i paesi...we have fun!!!!!!![QWERTY123]Marc is a very attentive and a funny person,  you can talk and practice the language  with him. Being at home has been a very pleasant experience. The Marc´s house is very near to the center, 5 minutes’ walk to Times Square or the meters line. He has a very cozy little house with a beautiful garden, and a bohemian or artistic style. I love Mark's house! If you are looking for something cozy, central and experience sharing a flat in New York, is the ideal place! Mark will help you in your stay in New York. Marc! Many kisses from Barcelona!!

Marc es una persona muy atenta y divertida con la que puedes conversar y practicar el idioma. Estar en su casa ha sido una experiencia muy agradable. Su casa está muy cerca del centro, a 5 minutos andando para Times Square o de los metros. Es una casa pequeña muy acogedora, con un hermoso jardín, y con un estilo bohemio o artístico. Me encanta la casa de Mark! Si se busca algo acogedor, céntrico y una experiencia de compartir piso en Nueva York, es el lugar ideal! Mark te ayudará en tu estancia en New York. Marc!!! Muchos besos desde Barcelona!!!![QWERTY123]I stayed at Mark´s Appartment for five days and had a great time there. 
He's a very pleasant person and an excellent NYC-Guide and makes you feel immediately welcome. Pretty cool place to stay! Location, Location, Location. Only five minutes walk to Times Square, Subway, Theater Distric and another major locations but also very quiet. It is clean, complimentary lighting and beautifully decorated. I loved to eat my breakfast at his nice terrace. The kitchen was very well set up and every morning I woke up the coffee already was made.
Thank you Mark.
[QWERTY123]Hi, wie had great time in NY staying @Marks appartment. 
The appartment is located in the heart of Manhattan and has a very interesting flair. It was always a feeling of coming home, when we arrived back from our tours, seeing candles lit. A great thing to mention is also the garden deck which belongs to the apartment, which is very cozy and amazing to have in this location. Mark is a very tidy(also the apartment), friedly and helpful person. He enjoys his life. He was a great host from the beginning(emails, questions etc. before our arrival and during our stay). I would definitely recommend him. Thanks Mark[QWERTY123]Mark is very accommodating with my schedule and a great host! You wouldn't find a better bargain in such a prime location!  A very easy walk to Time Sq. and the Subway.[QWERTY123]The apartment is very nice, clean and really well located. Mark was always very kind with us and helped accommodating all the needs, specially that we arrived very late from the airport.[QWERTY123]Fantastic location just a short walk to the subway and Times Square.  Mark was friendly and accommodating and made coffee for us every morning!

Our stay was comfortable, house was clean and tidy.[QWERTY123]The positive: Mark is a very friendly and easygoing person. His apartment is perfectly located in midtown, close to the subway and all Broadway theaters. It is also on the ground floor so no stairs to walk up with your luggage. Coffee was made every morning. He was very accommodating with my arrival/departure times.
The negative : the apartment is old, poorly maintained and very dirty. Most surfaces are covered with dust and hair, and the bathroom is very moldy, especially the bathtub. The single room is small and was scalding hot so I had to sleep with the window half open which got very noisy at night when it was raining or snowing.
[QWERTY123]My expectations were exceeded. Mark was helpful throughout the entire process from booking, arrival, stay, and departure. Additionally, he was very accomodating given my very early arrival and departure, this was extremely helpful! The apartment was clean, large, and extremely convenient (half a block away from a main subway station). I'd stay at Mark's place without hesitation in the future.[QWERTY123]Great trip in New York during Xmas and new year. Mark's place has great location. I walked around all the time. And jogging in central park. He himself is a nice guy! Thanks for letting me stay:)[QWERTY123]I had a very nice stay at Mark’s place. The apartment is central and the room very quiet for NY. Mark is very easy going. He is an experienced and friendly host. I recommend his place with no hesitation.[QWERTY123]Mark was a great host who accommodated me a instantly after my original host cancelled, and I'm really glad he did. The apartment was beautifully  maintained and location was excellent. Perfect for the solo traveller.[QWERTY123]Staying at Mark's place was a privilege : his flat is very well located, a block away from Time Square, really close to the bus terminal and a subway station. Although not so big, the flat is nice and well decorated. We haven't had the opportunity to spend time in the private garden, due to the cold and snowy weather, but it looks great. More important, it's calm and quiet, as it doesn't face a road. 
Mark himself is friendly, accomodating and not complicated. His French is good, and even better now he had welcomed 2 French guests ;-) In short, a great place to stay. 
Sorry Mark, but next time we'll come to New York, you'll have to welcome us again ;-)[QWERTY123]Small but homely apartment in a great area of Manhattan, close to a lot of attractions (Times Square, Empire State Building, Central Park) and near a subway so easy to get around. Mark was welcoming and extremely flexible with our late arrival time caused due to delayed flights![QWERTY123]A quiet apartment on the ground floor of a side street, toward the center of the block with a garden in the back.  The bed is comfortable and there is a closet with lots of hangars as well as drawers under the bed.  Mark has breakfast things such as bread, English muffins, yogurt, coffee and tea, and you can help yourself.  The spaces are small, but that is typical of New York.  Mark is a very relaxed host and we came and went during the day, even returning to nap in the afternoon.  It is a really good value for that location.[QWERTY123]I had a great stay at Marks place. 
Unfortunately the weather was very cold whilst I was there and the bedroom is extremely cold at night and the heater is very loud. Luckily I was very tired each night but wouldn't recommend this for light sleepers. 
Mark's place couldn't be in a better location for theatre lovers like myself and its great to be able to walk a few blocks and be able to roll into bed. 
Mark provides a lot of storage which can be rare in some airbnb places and was a great help. 
Hoping to head back to the city in the summer and will definitely check if Mark's place is available. 
[QWERTY123]We had an amazing few days in New York and Mark was a great host! The location is phenomenal, and though the space is a bit tight we had everything we needed and felt like we always had a ""home base"" to come back to :)
The heater in the bedroom was a bit on the noisy side, but we almost felt like it sounded like the ocean so we made the most of it!
A simple breakfast and available coffee every morning goes a long way as well.
Thanks again for having us, hopefully you'll get a chance to experience Nova Scotia some day as well! We'll warn you, it's not quite as busy here :)
[QWERTY123]Mark is a very friendly and helpful host and we had a warm welcome at his home. 
He is very considerate and courteous. We found everything as described. 
a wonderful week in NYC! thanks[QWERTY123]Had a great visit in Hell's Kitchen!  Mark has a great location so close to subway station and Times Square.  We sure appreciated the coffee each morning!  Jeanne and Paul[QWERTY123]This is the 3rd time I have stayed with Mark. As always it was a pleasure. His place is quiet and clean and all so convenient to everything especially the theaters.
I would not hesitate to stay there again.
[QWERTY123]We had a fantastic time in NYC!  Mark's apartment is perfectly located for exploring the city, particularly if you love the theatre - there are so many theatres within five or ten minutes walk!  Though small, the apartment had everything we needed, and was a calming place to come back to after all the sightseeing.  Mark is a great host, and we would thoroughly recommend his apartment to anyone.  Lovely breakfast muffins, and I particularly liked the French shower curtain!  Thanks so much x[QWERTY123]Excelente ubicación en pleno centro de Manhattan a menos de cinco minutos de times squre,Mark es muy amable y te ayuda en todo lo que le pides, recomendable.

excellent location in midtown Manhattan within five minutes squre times, Mark is very friendly and helps you in everything you ask, recommended
[QWERTY123]Un grand merci à Mark pour son accueil, chaleureux comme son sweet home. On se sent tout de suite bien chez lui. Idéalement situé et calme, juste à côté de Times Square, c'est l'endroit parfait pour visiter la plupart des lieux incontournables de NYC ou assister à une comédie musicale. Grâce à Mark, nous avons vu Kinky Boots de Cindi Lauper, super soirée !
Merci aussi à Mark pour ses bons conseils.
A bientôt à NYC ou en France.
Joce et Sabine
[QWERTY123]This is a great place to stay. The location is phenomenal and Mark is a fabulous host. He has thought a lot about what a traveller needs, notably: Insider information about the best way to get to his place from the airport, welcoming towels with guest soaps and lotions, and space; that is, places to put your things. Mark has created space in the medicine cabinet in the washroom for you to store your toiletries, and he has created space in the bedroom via a drawer under the bed and room in the closet to hang your clothes on a variety of hanger styles (bigger hangers for heavy coats, silk hangers for that little black dress, and trouser hangers too). I noticed a clothes iron was available too, though I didn't use it. Mark has a big bowl filled with the quintessential big, red apple, appropriately selected for those visiting The Big Apple. It's nice to have fresh fruit available. He also provides excellent, freshly-ground coffee, and lovely English muffins with apricot jam for breakfast. He also offers a variety of yoghurt flavors (banana, strawberry, blueberry, etc.), which makes for a well-rounded breakfast. Mark is a mild-mannered man who is very easy-going, friendly, and a great conversationalist. I highly recommend this spot![QWERTY123]Nous avons eu beaucoup de plaisir chez Mark. 
La chambre est vraiment très bien située: proche de Times Square et des lignes de métro ainsi qu'à côté de Hells Kitchen où se trouve une quantité incroyable de restaurants. De plus, l'endroit est très calme et aucun bruit ne vient troubler la nuit.
Mark était très gentil et serviable![QWERTY123]Mark it´s a very kind person, he help us in all our questions about the city, the place it´s very relaxing, the coffee was very good!!! and the location it´s perfect to explore the city!!! Mark: We miss the English Muffins and Yogurt!!! Thanks for all!!![QWERTY123]We had a great time in New York, our room at mark's flat was like at the picture shown. Clean and satisfying. We hadn't seen each other that much, but we always had a nice contact.[QWERTY123]nous avons passé une super semaine ,l'acceuil de Mark son dynamisme et son bon francais on rendu notre sejour trés agreable ,l'apart.est vraiment tres bien situé on peut faire bcp de chose à pieds ,nous avons du reste trés peu utilisé le metro ,les bonnes adresses de Mark,l'etaient effectiverment,on a pleinement profité de la terrasse le peu de belle journée que nous avons eu....
nous y reviendrons
Sylvie&gilles[QWERTY123]Diciamo che le foto non rendono l'idea di pulizia che dovrebbe avere una casa che si mette in affitto. Per il resto la compagnia era buona, l'ospite gentile, ma distaccato. Ottima la posizione, in piena zona di Broadway, comoda con tutte le necessità.[QWERTY123]This was the first time we used airbnb, and it certainly encouraged us to continue using it! Mark is a great host, the apartment is clean and located perfectly (it was our first time in NY and we visited A LOT, and it was easy and fast to get anywhere from there).
To sum up, it was a great experience![QWERTY123]I was very pleased with my host. He was very attentive and kind and respectful. I enjoy the little time I spent with my host, I wish I would have been longer! The neighborhood was amazing!! Up the block was Times Square and down the block was Hells Kitchen. It was great, cozy and very relaxing. There couldn't have been a better selection than the one I made.[QWERTY123]Mark is a wonderful host, room very clean, he is very helpful, it is location, location, location, a few minutes walk to Time Square very central to everything. This is my second visit to Marks place and would not hesitate to return.[QWERTY123]Expérience réussie pour une première avec AirBnB.
Mark s'est montré un hôte sympathique, et la chambre est conforme à l'annonce et extrêmement bien située, proche des transports et de toutes les attractions de New York.
J'aurai plaisir à revenir[QWERTY123]Vi blev budt pænt velkommen til NYC, fik en rundvisning i lejligheden og skulle lade som om vi var hjemme. Mark var en behagelig og venlig mand der var der for os, hvis vi manglede hjælp. Vores værelse var lille, og med kufferter havde vi lidt svært ved at komme rundt - men der var rent og hyggeligt. Beliggenheden var perfekt tæt på Times Square og alt det vi ville opleve.[QWERTY123]We stayed with Mark and his wonderful partner for five days. Our hosts were very kind and helpful.The location was the best, five minutes to Time Square and all the action. Restaurants are all around, grocery stores,   pharmacies etc. The place is certainly centrally located and the perfect place to stay. The host has a hot pot of coffee to welcome you each morning,the home is spotlessly clean,and there is a lovely patio which is lit with candles in the evening.We both enjoyed the time we spent with our host. We selected the perfect place. I would not hesitate to recommend this place to anyone. Thanks very much Mark, and Chao you are one of the kindest persons we met.
Surish and Carol.[QWERTY123]Accueil réservé nous expliquant rapidement les recommandations d'usage .[QWERTY123]This apartment is a stones throw from Times Square, Port Authority Bus Terminal, and Penn Station and as it was our first trip to New York I feel it was a great choice of location. Mark offered restaurant recommendations, and provided a great breakfast and excellent coffee. 

Despite it being a small apartment it felt very much like a home (which is what I'd expect from AirBnB) and not once did we feel awkward or like we were in the way.

My only criticism was that even though we were given a time to check out of the apartment as some renovation work was about to be carried out, we were asked to leave 45 minutes before that time as the Super of the building had arrived. Luckily we were ready to go and it wasn't too inconvenient, however we really did feel rushed and a little unwelcome at the end of our stay.[QWERTY123]We had an excellent stay with Mark and can't fault the location, only 2 blocks from times square and 2 minute walk to the nearest subway stop.

We were made to feel very welcome and had full use of the apartment. The apartment was of a good standard and as a bonus were really lucky with the weather so managed to have breakfast in the gated garden/decking area.

The English muffins and fresh coffee every morning were a great start to the day.

Mark was very helpful and was able to answer any questions we had regarding local attractions & transport or questions about New York in general. 

Would consider again if staying in NY![QWERTY123]Our stay at Marks apartment was really pleasant. He is a nice, calm and helpful host. The location is excellent.[QWERTY123]We hebben een erg leuke tijd gehad bij Mark. Dit is onze eerste Airbnb ervaring en het beviel erg goed. De kamer zag er netjes uit en was groot genoeg om al onze spullen in op te bergen. De locatie van het appartement is echt geweldig. Ook had Mark nog een paar goede tips voor restaurants in de buurt.[QWERTY123]Great location Subway is just half a block away. The bed was very comfortable. Mark is a very nice host how makes excellent coffee in the morning.[QWERTY123]Thank you so much for a cozy place to stay. It was so nice and you were so hospitable. Staying with you made me want to move to NYC. The location is perfect and it was just an incredible time. For anyone needing a place in the heart of it all this is the place to be. Thanks again![QWERTY123]Mark molto disponibile nel consigliare come vivere a New York e dove recarsi per mangiare, visitare e altro ancora.
Appartamento molto comodo perché in centro città.[QWERTY123]Mark was very welcoming even with my late arrival due to a flight. The apartment is clean and amazingly located, so close to Times Square is perfect for visiting the city! Would highly recommend a stay here.[QWERTY123]Mark's place was perfectly located, and just what I was looking for to work and visit around the Hell's Kitchen area. The room is small but comfortable, and everything in the apartment works as it should. There isn't a ton of shared space in the place, but Mark and his partner are both laid back and easy to hang out with, so I didn't feel cramped.

Overall, a good experience! I would particularly recommend the place to anyone who puts a high premium on location/convenience, as it is literally steps to any number of solid locations.[QWERTY123]Mark was a wonderful host and the apartment was lovely and clean. We felt very comfortable and had our privacy. Fresh coffee and breakfast was available every morning. The apartment is very close to time square and the subway. I would definitely recommend it.[QWERTY123]We spent twelve days in Mark´s apartment and our experience was perfect. The place is in a very good location, and everything was clean and comfortable. Besides, Mark and Chao were wonderful hosts, we felt like at home.[QWERTY123]Location, location, location - A great base for your NYC jaunt! We stayed for four nights and every day we were happier and happier with how convenient this place was to get to and from (and since it was freezing out, we needed to pop in quite frequently. The apartment and room was Manhattan-small but cozy, nicely decorated and it had everything we needed (including plenty of storage space). Mark made sure we had all the info we needed, before and during our stay.[QWERTY123]Mark's place looks like the pics.  It was quite cozy.  The location was perfect being only a half block from 8th Avenue and the Broadway theatres.  Mark made me feel at home and comfortable during my stay.  I would highly recommend staying here.[QWERTY123]I booked the accommodation at Mark's for my sister. Mark and his partner were very friendly and helpful.

They made my sisters time in NewYork even more special.
I will be staying there on my next trip to New York for sure...[QWERTY123]Superbe semaine chez Mark. L'appartement est idéalement placé, au centre de tout New York et ultra accessible. 

Mark est très sympa et offre le petit déjeuner tous les jours !

Rien à dire à part que cela donne envie de revenir ! 

Et pour les curieux voici mon blog de sur cette semaine à New York : (Website hidden by Airbnb)[QWERTY123]Liked the flat and enjoyed wonderful, freshly breewed coffee for b'fast!  The room was comfortable and warm and the location incredibly good!  Great price too.  Highly recommendable.[QWERTY123]What a perfect location of Mark's place! I had a very pleasant and comfortable stay with Mark who was an excellent host. I much appreciate his offer of a delicious sounding breakfast, though I didn't take him up on it. His apartment was quiet and the area safe and if you're travelling via EWR this is the place to stay! Thanks again and I look forward to seeing you on  future visits.[QWERTY123]Mark and Xiaomin were very welcoming. When my arrival flight was delayed, Mark stayed up until I was there. He had helpful tips regarding the airport shuttle, bus terminal and Greenwich Village.
I appreciated that they made a little space in the fridge for me to keep my special diet items. Everything was very clean, a nice interior design - unfortunately still too cold to enjoy the deck outside. I enjoyed the privacy and access to WiFi. Thank you for a great stay.[QWERTY123]Bon séjour chez Mark. Appartement TB situé à qlqs minutes de Time Square. Accueil fort sympathique. Ok pour café le matin. La terrasse privative est top ![QWERTY123]Mark and Shou were the perfect hosts, they made me feel so welcome and comfortable in their quaint home.  The outdoor space specifically was magnificent, they even have local flora and fauna on their expansive deck.  Steven the deck squirrel was a sweet little joy to behold in his nest.  I enjoyed the breakfast they created for me, simple and perfect.  And the coffee really punched me up for my busy days. Their place is literally a zen oasis in the center of perfect NYC chaos.  A great place to wind down and relax after long days of conferences and walking about.  Your Heaven in Hell's Kitchen is exactly that, with a kind, informative, caring couple to nourish and compliment your visit to NYC.[QWERTY123]Pour notre premier voyage à NYC, nous avons trouvé l'appartement idéalement situé (à 2 rues de Times Square et Broadway, métro à l'angle de la rue...), très pratique pour rentrer après une longue journée de périple puis de ressortir pour le dîner et ainsi profiter pleinement de la vie nocturne de Manhattan. 
Mark nous a offert le petit déjeuner tous les matins, La terrasse est très agréable avec en bonus la compagnie des écureuils. Mark et Xiaomin sont des hôtes très sympathiques. Nous recommandons ce logement pour vos vacances.[QWERTY123]Appartement charmant. Une terrasse en plein cœur de Manhattan c'est magnifique. Idéalement placé, à deux pas de Time Square. Nous ne pouvons pas parler de nos hôtes qui étaient absents. Logement à recommander.[QWERTY123]Mark was away when we arrived but arranged for a lovely friend to meet us and give us the keys. The apartment is absolutely beautiful, small but perfectly formed with a gorgeous little outdoor area. We had a fantastic stay. Mark was incredibly friendly and welcoming, helped us out with directions when we needed them and even recommended a fantastic nearby burger restaurant (5 Napkin Burger) for dinner on our first night while we were still trying to find our way around. The location couldn't be better, just two or three blocks from Times Square and Port Authority subway in one direction and the awesome bars and restaurants of Hell's Kitchen the other way. We'd 100% stay here again on future visits to NYC![QWERTY123]Mark and Xiao are great host and friendly! Their apt is amazing, clean, 3 minutes from Times Square, close to subway that takes you to everywhere in Manhattan. I definitely recomend their house!![QWERTY123]Mark and Xiao were very welcoming hosts!  The location of their place was perfect for a workshop in the theatre district.   We especially enjoyed the lovely private deck.   We hope to visit again![QWERTY123]Mark and Xiao were welcoming and friendly, they gave me advices if I needed them. They also offered me free breakfast in the morning anddidn't  have problems with my late check-in and check-out.

The location of the apartment is great, it's 5 minutes by foot from Times Square and 1 minute from the E subway that takes you directly to JFK. I also appreciated the quiet of the apartment and neighborhood, it's  like you're not in the center of Manhattan at all![QWERTY123]Mark & Xiao's apartment is in a really convenient location, just a couple of minutes walk from Times Square, the subway and also the Port Authority bus terminal which is connected by a direct bus link to Newark Liberty airport. It's a great base from which to explore all areas of the city and for experiencing the buzz of The Big Apple. The apartment is smaller than we expected but has a lovely decking area outside which we really appreciated as we drank our morning coffee and planned our daily activities via the WiFi connection. Mark was helpful when we asked for information and gave us some lovely recommendations, notably Bryant Park. He was also very flexible with our arrival and departure times and we greatly appreciated being able to shower and change and leave late on our last day ready for our long journey home.[QWERTY123]We enjoyed our stay in NY and the hospitality of Mark, Xiao and Franco their new, sweet puppy. We appreciated the flexibility for our arrival and departure time. The room was comfortable and a nice place to return in the late afternoon for a break before heading out again. The location was very convenient and close to the subway. We were a few minutes walk to Madison Square Garden and the Broadway Shows. We enjoyed our morning breakfasts in the courtyard and took advantage of the coffee, English muffins and jam that was offered. It was a memorable stay![QWERTY123]Super séjour chez Mark et son mari, personnes très sympathiques et appartement idéalement situé. Au pied de Times Square et de toutes commodités !![QWERTY123]On arrival Xiaomin greeted me and certainly made me feel very welcome.  He showed me my room and explained that Mark was working.  The apartment block is very old and modest so don't have high expectations.  If you are after ultra modern comfort then this is not the room for you.
The room I had was tiny, as was the whole apartment, and although there is a window there is no natural light.  I think the double room is brighter. This was a little disconcerting but I quickly adapted to the surroundings.  I found the bed very  comfortable.  There is a very pleasant outdoor area available for guests.
When I met Mark that evening he was also very friendly and hospitable.  As my stay progressed the relationship became more friendly and we had some very pleasant chats.  Thanks for that Mark.
The position is fantastic, 100 meters from the subway and right at Times Square.  I was keen to see as many Broadway shows as possible during my stay and I did this with just a short walk ""home"" afterwards among all the hoards of people.  I never ever felt unsafe.
I used the accommodation solely as sleeping quarters and suited me perfectly for my needs.
There are numerous restaurants and bars in the area plus all the theatres.  The TKTS booth is an eight minute walk away.  Penn Station is one stop away and the Port Authority Bus Station 2 minutes walk.[QWERTY123]We had delayed because of tranporting to the city. When we arrived in Mark& Xiao's apartment they were waiting for us. There was nothing about delaying.  Mark gave us some information about our room and breakfast.
Mark & Xiao were great hosts and friendly and helpful. Mark gave us many information and recommendations almost everymorning in their lovely courtyard while we had delicious coffees.
The apartment is a great location, so close to Times Square, the subway, the Port Authority bus terminal and to almost everywhere in Manhattan. Our room is smaller than we looked at on photos but is a sufficiently convenient and very clean. The courtyard was so beautiful and it was surprising to find in the middle of Manhattan like this very quietly place. Wi fi was powerful in the apartment everywhere.
The district is very safe and there are a lot of nice restaurants , bars , coffees and theatres.
Mark  & Xiao made us feel like staying our home.

Thank you for everything Mark & Xiao !![QWERTY123]Première expérience airbnb réussie. La chambre est idéalement située tout près de Times square ainsi que du métro.  Les hôtes sont très accueillant et nous mettent à l'aise.[QWERTY123]Welcoming, nice, interesting couple. Great location. Amazingly quiet, being so close to Times Square and 42nd street. Nice patio to enjoy in the warmer months. Great public transportation close by.[QWERTY123]Mark and Xiao were phenomenal hosts! They made us feel welcome in their home and were extremely friendly to us at all times throughout our stay. They were both very compassionate and understanding individuals, especially when it came to my Tourette’s. The room was a bit smaller than I had expected, but that’s just a personal observation and wasn’t an issue at all. The bed was comfortable, the room was cozy, and the neighborhood was great — right near an awesome vegan place that my girlfriend and I both loved! I just want to add that as a New Yorker myself, I felt that people in Manhattan are generally not as friendly as people elsewhere, such as in Providence and Boston. However, Mark and Xiao were an incredible exception to that rule. They are genuinely caring and all-around amazing people, and I would definitely book again if my girlfriend and I come back! Thanks Mark and Xiao![QWERTY123]Mark and Xiao were very helpful and supportive during my stay (3 nights). It was the first time for airbnb and they made me impress and confident on using the website!! I recommend everyone who is looking for NY accommodation to stay here!! Not only is this place super convenient but the host are also give a warm welcome. The only bad thing I could find is the space but this is TIME SQUARE NEW YORK!! The rest are as displayed in website. Nice and clean.[QWERTY123]It is great staying with Mark and Xiao, there's lots of interaction and communication with them. The room is rather small but their apartment is conveniently located - the street corner subway entrance, 5 min walk to port authority bus terminal and less than 15 min walks to most broadway theatre. The neighbourhood is safe. The laundry room is useful for us.[QWERTY123]Mark and Xiao were fantastic hosts during my vacation to NYC. They were both extremely friendly and welcoming throughout the trip, and went out of their way to make sure I had everything I needed. The apartment was beautiful, and very clean. Their chihuahua mix is very high energy and very friendly. When I was out of the apartment I could always contact them when I had questions. Their apartment is in a terrific location, especially if your plans involve the theater. I was able to walk everywhere I needed to go within minutes. 

Overall, Mark's ad covers all the information you need to know before booking them. The only surprise was that Mark and Xiao sometimes have massage clients come to the apartment during which they want to maintain privacy. However, they are very good about letting you know in advance when they need the apartment. 

This was my longest stay in an Air B'n'B apartment, and Mark and Xiao made it an excellent experience. I highly recommend them![QWERTY123]Excellent location. This place has everything you need to have an incredible time in NewYork. It is super clean with very nice upkeep. Mark and Xiao were very helpful.They tell us where delicious fun, can help us to answer all the questions, and they give us to prepare breakfast. Their dog is very cute, and we love him.We had a great time  and really enjoyed our stay here. We recommend to all, and hope to return some day.[QWERTY123]Mark was a great host he made me feel very welcome upon arrival. The room is nice with lots of places to put your things. There was also space for me in the kitchen and bathroom.I loved the neighborhood it was away from the choas of time square but close enough that you could walk everywhere from the apartment, the transport links were idea. The street 9th half a block from the flat has tons and tons of cute restaurants, cafes, and bars. Also shops if you need anything like clothes of pharmacy. Staying at this flat in particular made my stay in new york so relaxed and adaptable. I definitely recommend it for anyone who wants to be in the center but be able to get anywhere in the city at short notice. Mark was very flexible with my schedule and it felt like staying in a home. I highly recommend them for your trip.[QWERTY123]The apartment was great! Mark and Xiao were very interested and helpful when we needed tips or when we just wanted to chat. Their dog, Franco, is very cute and playful. They made us feel at home and gave us a tour of the beautifully designed apartment![QWERTY123]Très bonne semaine à NY chez Mark et Xiaomin. Excellent accueil de la part de nos hôtes. Nous nous sommes sentis comme à la maison. L appartement est très agréable et très bien situé, proche du métro. Mark et Xiaomin( et Franco bien sûr) sauront très bien vous accueillir! Nous recommandons vivement cette adresse![QWERTY123]Tres bonne adresse que nous recommandons! Nous avons passés mon ami et moi un très agréable moment chez eux et en leur compagnie. 
Super emplacement, appartement confortable. 
Mark et Xiao sont des personnes très très sympa, très accueillantes avec qui on discute facilement. 
Leur petit chien Franco est trop mignon et gentil comme tout. 
Bref on s'y sent bien[QWERTY123]J'ai passé un séjour chez Mark et Xiao très agréable , ces deux hôtes sont accueillants et vraiment sympathiques , et  toujours disponibles . J'ai passé d'excellents moments en leur compagnie et de très bonnes soirées, mais je n'oublie pas le petit Francki que j'ADORE  . Je suis sûre que nous nous reverrons .
L'appartement est convivial , chaleureux , calme et très bien situé  dans Manhattan ,vous pouvez faire tout à pied.
JE VOUS RECOMMANDE CETTE RESERVATION - TOUT EST EXCEPTIONNEL . Merci à vous 
[QWERTY123]Magnifique séjour à NYC chez Marc et Xiao. Ils sont charmants, accueillants et toujours prêts à se rendre utile. Leur appart est petit mais très cosy et meublé avec gout (on s'y sent bien d'emblée) et le jardin est extra (je pense qu'un jardin de cette taille est rare dans ce quartier). Idéalement situé à 5 min à pied de Time Square et donc de Broadway et de ses shows et de toutes les facilités de transport. Étonnamment calme pour la situation. Je recommande vivement.[QWERTY123]Really great experience! Marc and Xiaomin (and their dog Franko)  are very good host.
The apartment is comfortable and pretty close to Time Square.[QWERTY123]Mark and Xiao were fantastic hosts, super friendly and nice. Their place is cute and clean and very well located, right in the heart of midtown. My stay with them was perfect, I only wish I could have stayed more. Their dog, Franco, was the most adorable bonus! Totally would stay with them again and again![QWERTY123]The flat is beautiful and its location unbeatable. The bed is also nice. The indications were clear and Mark was always willing to help me. The garden is really a piece of heaven.  

However, if you go in hot season the AC is very noisy. One day my host woke me up at 10 to get something out of the room while I was sleeping. I did no appreciate this.[QWERTY123]My husband and I spend 5 wonderful days in New York with Mark and Xiao. Their apartment is stylish and comfortable in the most convenient location we could imagine -- just blocks from theatre district and great restaurants, right on a metro line, and a comfortable walk to Central Park. Their deck garden is FABULOUS; and Mark and Xiao are delightful company and wonderful hosts along with their dog Franco. Looking forward to staying with them again the next time we visit New York.[QWERTY123]Hospitable, easy-going, and friendly. Clean place, great location. Thank you![QWERTY123]Séjour très sympathique chez Mark et Xiao.
Très discret et de bon conseil
Je recommande 
[QWERTY123]I really enjoyed my stay with mark and xiao. The location was ideal and very easy to get around to everywhere in Manhattan from. I especially loved their large garden area to sit in an zone out after a big day of sightseeing. Mark always made me coffee fresh for breakfast with fresh fruit and English muffins which was very convenient and a nice way to start the day. Much better than a hotel![QWERTY123]Mark was a hospitable host with a fantastic partner and friendly little dog once he gets to know you. I was not around much but Mark never failed to provide me with anything I asked and always had a clean well maintained house.[QWERTY123]Had the best time at Mark and Xiou place. Very easy going and flexible hosts. So hospitable and their outdoor space was pure heaven. Felt we had dropped into Asia instead of NYC. Fab location. Amazing decor. Designer heaven! 
Can walk everywhere or Subway is at corner of their street. Great food and theatre nearby. Franco very cute too! Def will visit again. ..our no 1 recommended place to stay in Nyc.[QWERTY123]We had an amazing time in NYC, a large part of that experience was due to our stay with Mark and Xiou. The apartment was located in a amazing neighborhood in NYC, close to times square, empire state, a lot of good restaurants and metro/bus. Hosts are very friendly and flexible. The room is quite small but was big enough for us with enough space to store your baggage. Outside space was nice to eat breakfast in or relax after a long day in New York. Would recommend and come again if i'm ever in New York again![QWERTY123]Très chaleureux accueil de Mark, Xiaomin et Franco.
Toujours à notre écoute et de bon conseil pour nos visites au sein de New York.
Une bonne compréhension du Francais nous a permis de bien dialoguer.
Bon petit déjeuner avec thé ou café, les meilleurs muffins des Etats Unis, beurre, fruit et yogourt ...
L'appartement est très bien situé à 2 pas de toutes commodités métro, times square ...
Nous recommandons vivement.

[QWERTY123]Super accueil de la part de Mark et Xiao, tous les 2 sont très sympathiques (sans oublier le petit chien Franco). Dommage que Mark soit parti en voyage le lendemain de notre arrivée, mais Xiao a été de bonne compagnie et toujours prévenant.
L'appartement est très bien situé à 5 mn du métro et de Times Square. La chambre est petite mais c'est suffisant pour dormir. Le lit est très confortable.
Le plus est le petit jardin, en plein cœur de New York c'est rare... Un petit havre de paix après une longue journée de marche au milieu de la foule. Ainsi que le petit déjeuner dans le jardin, vraiment très appréciable.
Nous sommes restées 6 nuits avec ma fille et nous sommes vraiment enchantées.
It is really Heaven in Hell's kitchen !
[QWERTY123]Mark and Xiaomin's hospitality was really warm! 
The announcement was absolutely truthful: 
the house and my room were both cute and clean; the deck garden was also beautiful, a perfect place to have breakfast or take a rest.
I heard Mark by email in the weeks before my arrival, he was helpful and kind to provide me with information about the house and the airport transfer.
At home there was Xiaomin to welcome me, along with the dog Franco, a nice big chihuahua; during the week we better knew each other. Xiaomin was very kind and helpful providing me with info on the subway; at the same time he was discreet and respectful of my space and my moments of rest and reading. He also prepared delicious breakfast each morning, a luxury for airbnb ... I think.

The location was... perfect, so central, in the heart of Mid Town, so close to Times Square...

I felt like at home,and I felt moved when I leaved Xiaomin last Monday. I hope we will stay in touch ...
For sure I will recommend Mark and Xiaomin's house to friends who intend to visit New York.[QWERTY123]Appartement super bien situé tout près de Time Square.  Si on veut sortir des zones hyper touristiques,  on est a 2 pas d'un spot avec plein de bons restaurants.  On a trippé sur le jazz bar le Birdland et le resto The Marshall.[QWERTY123]Mark and Xiao were so great! Their place is super close to Times Square (like seriously two blocks away) and their restaurant recommendations were on point. They were kind enough to leave me brochures next to my bed with ideas of things to do and even a subway map - although I mostly relied on (Hidden by Airbnb) Maps, to be honest. Also, providing breakfast was great and unexpected and very much appreciated (especially since I got to eat it on the fantastic back porch). Overall, they were really nice and always made me feel welcome and never like I was imposing. I would definitely recommend staying with them, as I would do it again in a heartbeat![QWERTY123]Mark's apartment is the perfect base to visit NY Manhattan. My wife and I enjoyed 5 days staying in the apartment and everything was so close and convenient. 

We met Mark a few days before leaving and he couldn't have been more helpful or welcoming while simultaneously giving us space to enjoy our holiday independently.

The apartment is well decorated with some lovely features as well as all the conveniences you would expect.

Highly recommended![QWERTY123]The apartment is in a great location and Mark was a friendly host.[QWERTY123]Très bonne 1ere fois avec airb&b.  Mark était très sympathique et toujours prêt a nous aider. Il parle français ce qui nous a grandement facilité le voyage.
Le logement est très bien situé dans manathan.
Je recommande vivement un séjour chez Mark.[QWERTY123]Ils sont vraiment sympa et disponible. Nous avons beaucoup discuté avec eux. Ils sont de bons conseils.
L'appartement est très bien situé.
[QWERTY123]Appartement très bien situé pour un séjour à NYC, hôtes très accueillants et disponibles. Appartement chaleureux et intimité respectée. Un grand merci pour cette première expérience. Je recommande et je reviendrais avec plaisir.[QWERTY123]Mark and Xiao are very hospitable and warm-hearted.  They gave us tips regarding good restaurants and were always very helpful if we had questions. We also had some nice conversations with them. As the apartment is centrally located, we didn't  have to use the subway often. We slept very good, the bed was comfortable and there was no noise. The breakfast was very good too. It's a  cosy and clean apartment in which we felt comfortable. Franco the little dog is cute and friendly. All in all we really enjoyed our stay there and definitely recommend it to everyone![QWERTY123]The flat is so well located in the midtown area of NYC and it's really cozy and nice! Considering how central it was the room was incredibly quiet and the bed heaven comfy. The hosts are really nice and welcoming! I was really busy visiting the city so I didn't have much time to spend with them but the little bit I talked to them was very pleasant! Their dog is also adorable! Finally, something I found amazing is the shower had really good water pressure and a shower head that could be moved around. I highly recommend this place to anyone interested in staying in Manhattan.[QWERTY123]Great apartment really close to times square on foot. Really close to subway station and bus station.
The flat is not very big but it is calm and very quite.
Mark and Xiao are very friendly and Mark speaks french..We don't forget Franco a very nice small dog!
We  clearlyrecommend this apartment[QWERTY123]This is the perfect location for exploring the city with very close proximity to subways and bus stations! Mark and Xiao were very hospitable and little doggie Franco was a delight. Highly recommendable.[QWERTY123]El departamento te brinda lo que ofrece (calidez, linda decoración, silencio, excelente ubicación y cercanía de medios de transporte y un sabroso desayuno). Es cómodo, con un lindo patio en donde puedes ver el cielo y disfrutar de sus plantas. Mark y Xiao fueron amables, y Franco una simpática y juguetona compañía. Debido a mis paseos cotidianos y a sus ocupaciones laborales no tuvimos muchas ocasiones para conversar, pero cuando fue necesario me ayudaron a resolver problemas. El edificio apaga la calefacción de noche, y puede hacer algo de frío, pero ellos me aportaron otra manta con lo que estuvo todo bien. Departamento muy recomendable.[QWERTY123]Location location location! This was a great little stay right in the heart of it all. Suited myself and my son perfectly as we were our most days and needed somewheee safe and comfortable to rest our heads! Very happy with our Airbnb choice![QWERTY123]Mark and Xiao are very great. It’s been an amazing time and I surely recommend it to anyone who intends to stay for a short or long time[QWERTY123]I really enjoyed my stay with Mark and Xiao. They are friendly, helpful and respectful of your personal space. I especially appreciated Mark taking the time to show me where to get value-for-money groceries in the neighbourhood. Xiao is thoughtful and considerate. No issues with Franco their pet chihuahua. The apartment is cozy and clean. The bathroom isn't in the best shape but Mark bought a new shower mat and curtain to spruce it up a little, which I also appreciated. The outdoor deck is a luxury to have for NYC. Overall, great space in an amazing location."	40.759785584518426	-73.99119343321742	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/16421	1	52.0	0.866667

Very recommended![QWERTY123]L’appartement corresponds parfaitement a ce qui est décrit sur le site il est spacieux, agréable, et très jolie, bien équipé (internet, frigo,  cuisson). Vous trouverez sans mal ou manger dans e coin, il y a même des endroits ouverts 27/7/

Il est aussi facile d’accès, plusieurs lignes de Subway pour atteindre l’appartement. Les lignes de Subway sont à respectivement 5 et 10 minutes à pieds donc très accessible à n'importe quelle heure.

Je n'ai pas eu la chance de rencontrer Luna directement, mais elle a été réactive dès que j'ai eu besoin d'informations (phone et mail).
J'ai été accueilli a mon arrivé tout était parfaitement orchestré.

Quoi qu'il en soit je vous le recommande vraiment si vous voulez un appartement qui vous permettra d'être à Time Square en moins de 30 minutes.[QWERTY123]I had a great experience staying at Luna´s Place! The place is perfectly located in a very cultural area of NYC between 2 Subway stations, and a cross town bus, so it was easy getting around NYC. There is also a great Bikram Yoga studio down the street for those yogi´s visiting. For those concerned with neighborhood safety, I often came home late and felt safe. Her Apartment is a great size, a LARGE Studio for NY standards, and has everything one needs! Very comforting. Luna is also a great renter, if there was anything I needed she was quick to respond. I definitely recommend staying at Luna´s for short or longer visits!
[QWERTY123]Luna's apartment was simple, clean, and very well located to both the green and red subway lines. My experience there was quit nice.  The neighborhood can catch you off guard if you arrive at night. But its charm really grows after spending some time walking around. Logistically, Luna handled everything very well, even though my train arrived quite late. Overall, Luna's place is a pleasant reminder that Manhattan still has some spots that don't make you feel like your in a shopping mall.[QWERTY123]Luna was very accommodating and extremely helpful. Check in/out were a breeze and I loved the apartment.

Large space and very close to multiple subway lines.[QWERTY123]Laura is a great host, super friendly and checking upon me regularly to see all is well, her place is super value for money, clean and spacious for New York and very conveniently situated. I had a great time! Anytime again![QWERTY123]Luna’s place is spacious for a solo traveler (like myself) and central to several main subway lines. This host is very communicative and receptive to questions.[QWERTY123]The apartment is very big for New York Standards. Everything was very clean and the apartment has a good equipment. The location is great, line 2/3 stop and line 6 stop are close by so you‘re pretty fast everywhere in nyc. The neighborhood is safe and very authentic. Luna is a Great Host, very responsive and friendly. Overall this apartment is a good deal."	40.798514192953014	-73.94399070712562	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/5022	1	80.0	0.8
11	5099	"I had a great experience at Tina's ""True NYC Apt."" She was a fabulous hostess and her place is adorable. Very spacious with a 40's kind of vibe. loved it. She's a very sweet person and caring of her visitors and we loved her cats! I would definitely recommend Tina's home to anyone![QWERTY123]My girlfriend and me had a wonderful time at Tina's place. It is so cosy and relaxed and we would recommend the apartment to anyone and definitely consider to go back again !!![QWERTY123]Everything is great about this place proximity to food, grocery, bars everything. Its cosy, spacious, quiet. She is a really nice hostess too (We did go to that Rare rooftop bar n it was splendid thr). I would definitely go back and stay over there if there is a chance, and recommend her place to everyone.[QWERTY123]Dead cockroaches. Cat hair everywhere. Not very clean.[QWERTY123]What a fantastic location and friendly neighbourhood.
We walked in to town everyday and felt perfectly safe at night time.
The flat was a nice size and everything we needed was there. The air conditioning in the bedroom was especially powerful and welcome in the hot summer heat!
The only drawback for us was Tina's 2 friendly cats as I'm not really a cat lover and found it difficult to deal with. However, Tina was very clear in her advert that she has cats so that was entirely MY fault for not reading carefully!!
An enjoyable trip![QWERTY123]We absolutely loved Tina's place. It is really close to everything and bigger than we expected it to be. Plus, her cats are amazing. We didn't want to leave we loved them so much. They are both super loving. It is an older building and apartment but that's kind of part of the NYC experience I guess. I was a bit unhappy that I didn't know it was a smoker's apartment until too late but once we got there and settled in, it didn't matter at all. We'd stay there again.[QWERTY123]We enjoyed staying at Tina's apartment. The location was amazing, easy to keep tidy, and had everything we needed in there.

Tina was there to greet us when we arrived, she was very friendly and explained everything we'd need to know very clearly, and was accessible the whole time we were there.

There were only two small downsides, the first being the cats - although they were really lovely and friendly, we were faced with cleaning up poop and vomit one day, though that's nobody's fault. If you've never had cats before you might find this a bit daunting but we got on with it and it wasn't really a problem. The other downside was the outside noise, even with the windows closed it was quite noisy (with the traffic constantly moving outside), but we were so tired every night that we slept fine anyway.

Thanks again Tina. :)[QWERTY123]We enjoyed our stay at Tina's apt & she was an excellent hostess. The apt is centrally located & the cats were not an issue with us.[QWERTY123]very enjoyable. tina was great.you must like cats. i repeat you must like cats. i do, so i had no problem.the five flight walkup can be hard after a long day out but it was worth it. very close to grand central station so you can get anywhere in manhattan. grocery storesd, bars, restaurant are all nearby on third st also lexington. it is an older buildind but very safe area. thanks tina it was great[QWERTY123]Tina's apartment was great. It was very well situated being just 10 min walk from Grand Central Station and the Empire State Building. It is very well situated putting you in the best possible area. Lots to see and do and above all a very safe neighbourhood. Tina's cats were lovely and very affectionate. We had a great time and would stay there again. Thanks Tina x[QWERTY123]Amazing Apt To Stay in While Visiting NY, 5 minute Walk to Grand Central, 10 minute walk To Time Square, About 5 Block Or So to The Famous 5th Ave. Apt Was Clean, Spacious And very Cozy. Cats were Very Sweet And The Neighborhood Was Great, nice place to Just Come Home To Relax And Watch Cable After A Day On The Town. Thank you So Much Tina, If we Ever Visit NY Again We Will Be Sure to Look you Up! :-) P.S. Tina Was Ontop Of Everything While We Visited Always Checking up making sure everything was Ok VIA Text. Thank you Again[QWERTY123]Fantastic apartment, 5-10mins walk from Grand Central Station and easy walking to 5th Ave, Times Square and Empire State. Loved her cats, very affectionate, still miss having them on my lap watching cable after a day out sightseeing. Many shops round the corner for a late night bagel or groceries. Tina was very understanding when we got in later than planned due to a problem with our flight and was very helpful. Would definitely recommend. Thanks, Tina![QWERTY123]You must be in shape to visit Tina apartmant. It's a 5fl walk up a little hard after a ling walk around city. Her cats are very nice they always hungry and ask for food which some mistake for being affectionate. I bought them food and they became more mellow. Apartmant was a dusty and needed cleaning when I arrived. Cat hair was everywhere, carpet needed to he cleaned. Shower wasn't working which wasn't very pleasant. As I had to go to my local gym to take a shower! Do NOT recommend. Blaming her shower wasn't working by me putting towels in bath. Womans nuts!
Now she's suing me for ""taking her pillow"".[QWERTY123]Wonderful 1 bedroom apt with all stuff you want. Furthermore cable and more importantly easy and fast internet.
The apt is centrally located. All important places within walking distance and via Grand Central you enter the whole city conveniently by metro. The M15 bus stop downtown is right around the corner.
It's a brilliant and very safe place with a great neighbourhood: Bars, restaurants, supermarkets, late night delis and much else.
Two lovely and easy-care cats - I loved it to come home and be welcomed joyously by the two pleasant cats.
I really recommend Tina's apt. Splendid hostess! Thank you Tina![QWERTY123]Tina was extremely friendly and led up with text messages to make sure everything was going well. No wifi as advertised but there was internet through Ethernet cable. Place is just like the pictures and was spacious and clean when we got there but make sure you like cats as they do shed quite a bit of fur. The area was great and close to everything, so if ur a visitor/tourist then this place is perfect.  I will definitely reccomend Tina to anyone as she really was great and tried to be as accommodating as possible. Thanks for everything again Tina!![QWERTY123]Is glad to stay in Tina's Apt. the apt is just closed to the convinent store (around the corner), food (1 block away) and take another 7 to 10 blocks to times square..
[QWERTY123]We recently stayed at Tina's apartment for a week.  The location is great as it is about a 10-minute walk from the Grand Central Station which with the subway can take you any where you want to go. The distance to the Airport Bus station that will take you with your luggage to the airport is also nearby. It is in a safe neighborhood.

There is fast food and restaurant within a 2 block walk which is certainly convenient.  The place is what is in the picture.  It is clean when as promised.  Do note that there is a $50 cleanup fee to be paid upon arrival.  We thought the fee should be waived or be included inside the rental fee as it is the owner's obligation to hand over a clean apartment.

Having to walk up the 5 floors has not been a problem even with 3 big luggages.  Having no wifi as advertised is also not a problem as we brought along our Apple Airport Express.

You must love cats to stay in this apartment as they shed hair all week round.  It would be good to have a vacuum cleaner or a hair remover around. The poo smell of the cats was a little strong in the last couple of days of our stay.

Tina was very friendly and had to leave the town for a few days.  She did leave an email to inquire if everything was alright.  That was thoughtful of her.  She also helped with maps of NY as well as advice about transport back to the airport for us which came in handy.

Overall, a good place to stay in place of location and accessibility.  Thanks Tina, for your help.[QWERTY123]The apartment has an excellent location, you can go wherever in Manhattan by subway. The Central Station is within 5-10 minutes walking. The neighbourhood is good as well, you have some restaurantes nearby like subway, mcdonalds, sushi etc. There is also a mini market next door  where you can buy food and drink and the supermarket is 2 blocks away.
Tina gave us a NYC guide and it was really useful, she left many brochures from restaurants also to order food at home.
The cats aren't bad but they aren't clean at all, we found poop on the kitchen table once and we had to clean vomit like 4 times because one of them seemed to be sick. Because of this we didn't like to cook or even to eat at home and we didn't use the sofa because we found vomit there also.
The windows have no blinds or dark curtains, so the neighbours can see you at any time in the bedroom and the kitchen.
It is a 5th floor without elevator, it wasn't a problem for us but you should be aware of it.
I do recommend Tina's place if you are looking for a well located place to sleep, but not to spend much time there.[QWERTY123]it was a pleasure to meet tina and to be gast in her appartement. the appartement is really close to grand central station and 5th avenue and also there is a bus station in front of the house that brings you downtown to 2nd avenue 1st street where is a good spot to go out for dinner and drinks. the appartement is in the 5th floor and directly under the rooftop which is a nice place to go up and pause a second.
we really enjoyed the stay!
the only problems we had was the internet that didn`t worked with our own laptops...we had to go to mc donalds arround the corner to check them.[QWERTY123]Tinas Apt ist a true NYC Apt. We had a great time and directly felt at home. The Neigbourhood is nice with lots of restaurants and bars. 
Tina was very friendly and directly responded to all questions and even wrote us a list with recommendations and places to see. 
I would definetly go back.[QWERTY123]Tina's place was great!  A great location and a true new york apartment. The only downside was her cat that meowed a lot! Overall though we had an amazing stay. We definitely recommend staying with her![QWERTY123]My partner and I really enjoyed our stay in Tinas apartment. It's a nice old apartment with everything you need and Tina is a good guide if you have any questions. Only down side is it's loud when you have the windows open - closed is fine.

(I read that she had a loud cat in one of the earlier reviews and will let people know that it's no longer there)[QWERTY123]Tina is a great host and very accessible. The apartment is a perfect size and has everyhting you need. We had a great stay. Thank you![QWERTY123]Nuestra estancia en new York fue fantástica y Tina se portó genial con nosotros. El apartamento está muy céntrico y es un buen sitio para ir de vacaciones y visitar la ciudad. Muy recomendable[QWERTY123]We had a wonderful stay at Tina’s apartment in September 2013. Tina is a great host, she was very understanding about our flight delay and helpful in giving us some hints concerning best places to visit. The apartment is in a very conveninet location, close to Grand Central, midtown is within the walking distance. The apartment itself is very comfortable and neat. Only drawback is that it can get really noisy because of the morning traffic. The neighborhood itself is very comfortable with many convenient stores, bars, pubs and diners. We really enyojed our stay![QWERTY123]Tina is a lovely host. She welcomed us on arrival and was so friendly and helpful and gave us some great local info on what to see. The apartment is charming - we definitely felt like we stayed in a true NYC apartment. Would definitely stay at Tina's place again.[QWERTY123]Tina is a great host, very accessible and has very good tipps where to go and what to see in NY! The appartment is cosy, everything was clean. We can warmly recommend Tinas place![QWERTY123]Tina was a great host. She was very welcoming and helpful and was open to letting us check in and leave when it was convenient for us. The place was clean, decorated, and in a convenient location. I would definitely recommend staying there![QWERTY123]The reservation was canceled the day before arrival. This is an automated posting.[QWERTY123]Fun place to stay if you are doing stuff at the UN (5 minute walk). Tina is friendly and helpful, her flat is full of books and artworks (she's an artist and musician). Lot cooler than yr average NY hotel.
This was my first airbnb experience, and I will definitely be doing it again, even though I'm not sure it was a whole lot cheaper than a grotty hotel.
Only hassle was a mix-up over a cleaning fee after I left - why not just include it in the upfront cost?[QWERTY123]This was a fantastic place to stay. Tina's a delightful host--she met us on arrival and she was always available to answer a quick email or phone call if we had a question. Her apartment is cozy and welcoming. It's also perfectly located….only about a 5-10-minute walk from Grand Central. Fun neighborhood, too. We'd definitely stay here again![QWERTY123]Tina couldn't have been a more friendly and attentive host! She met me when I arrived and even lugged my suitcase up the stairs! Throughout my stay, she stayed in communication to ensure that everything was fine, which it was. The apartment was clean, the bed was comfortable, and the shower was excellent! The neighborhood felt safe and everything one needs is close-by. Tina and her apartment are keepers![QWERTY123]Tina is a most gracious and caring host. She personally welcomed me to the apartment and explained the various amenities. The apartment itself was clean and cosy, making me immediately feel at home. Tina send me several messages afterwards asking if there was anything I needed which I appreciated very much. The neighbourhood is at walking distance from big attractions like Time Square and the Empire State Building. Don't expect a quiet stay though because the Manhattan symphony of sirens, car horns and engine noise comes full blast through the windows 24/7. If you can stand that, there is no better place to be in New York. If you don't like walking stairs you might want a place that has an elevator.[QWERTY123]Tina is a fantastic host. She personally greeted us and helped us get installed in the apartment. She also was kind enough to give us a lot of helpful information from nearby stores and restaurants; and was checking with us daily to make sure that everything was OK. The apartment is very cozy and has a great location,  only a few blocks away from Grand Central you can go pretty much anywhere in Manhattan by subway. 

Overall: Great Host, and fantastic location.[QWERTY123]We stayed at Tina's for a few days and it could have not gone better. The place is exactly as is appears on the photos, comfy, cozy and mega central, we fell right at home from moment one. The bed is super comfortable and the sheet in particular were delightful.  She made some room for our stuff so we could have our stuff out comfortably and left us some nice toiletries to last our stay at her place. The air con machine and fan that she has in the apt were extremely welcome! Tina was a wonderful host and got out of her way numerous times to help us out. Our flight was delayed and she hang around to be able to welcome us properly, she took the time to know us and gave us great advice on the city, places to go, where to eat etc... She was always available on the phone and got back to us immediately every time. We could not be happier with her and the stay at her place. She became our New York Fairy Godmother![QWERTY123]We just finished our 9 night stay in Tina's apartment and had an amazing time! 

The apartment is clean, bright and well decorated. It's greatest asset is its location. It's right near Grand Central Station which means you can get virtually anywhere in New York - essential if you're travelling. It's also in a safe neighbourhood meaning you feel perfectly safe walking around after dark. However the noise from the street does carry up into the apartment, so if you're a light sleeper I'd recommend buying ear plugs.

Tina is a great host. When we arrived, she ran through all of her favourite places to eat in the neighbourhood - she even knew awesome places that have gluten free options. She checked in with us daily and readily answered any questions we had about the places we were visiting.

Would highly recommend staying here if you're visiting New York![QWERTY123]Tina was a wonderful host, from the get go she was easy to contact and swift in replying to messages or emails. 

The place itself is right in the heart of the city, really close to grand central which gets you anywhere and right near some wonderful restaurants and bars! My personal fav was a ramen place on 3rd avenue! 

Everything was clean and easy to use and the shower was hot and strong, which I hear is rare in manhattan. 

Just be warned that it's noisy in midtown so soak it up or take some earplugs! But that's all part of the manhattan experience![QWERTY123]Tina was great!! She met us at the apartment showed us the ropes and checked on us each day. Her recommendations for food in all different areas of the city were spot on delicious. We did struggle with the five flights of stairs, no blinds on the windows and very aged mattress. But the neighborhood was very nice, safe and great food just right down stairs ""Bravest"". Subway was a few blocks away. Overall we had a great trip and would do it again in a heart beat.[QWERTY123]Tina is the best host ever, charm and knowledgeable, we really enjoy the stay. The apt is actually bigger than it looks on the pic, cozy and easy to every attraction. Will definitely come back again![QWERTY123]The reservation was canceled 10 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.[QWERTY123]Staying at Tina's place was great, it's a lot bigger than it looks in the pictures. We had a great time![QWERTY123]Tina's apartment is great, clean and well located. The bed made us feel like in a cloud !
Unfortunately we could not meet Tina but one of his friends has been waiting for us until we arrived even later than expected. When we had questions during our stay he was quickly available and Tina often get back to us to be sure that everything was ok. 
This apartment really made us feel as if we were New Yorkers ;)[QWERTY123]Tina was a great host, very helpful and friendly! She even helped my sister out with letting her stay another night due to hotel booking mix up! The apartment was nice and clean in a perfect area, 10 min walk to Times Square and with restaurants and bars just around the corner. We highly recommend Tina as a host and would love to stay at her apartment next time as well! /Lisa, Martin and Lotta[QWERTY123]The host canceled this reservation 20 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.[QWERTY123]Tina was a fantastic host. She checked in frequently and always responded to questions. 

Her place was just what we needed. The location was maybe 5 blocks from Grand Central terminal and with a 7 day unlimited transit pass. We could get anywhere really easily.[QWERTY123]Tina was a great host, the apartment was really nice and cozy. She greeted me at the door and explained how everything works. She gave me some good recommendations with places where to go out. The neighborhood is very lively and there's many bars to go out nearby. The apt is located near grand central station, which is great for getting to and from the airport. There are many sights nearby to go out and see the city since it's in the heart of Manhattan. I would definitely stay there again if I return to NY.[QWERTY123]Tina was a tremendous host. It was easy to stay in touch with her and she met me in the apartment to hand off the keys. She was super accommodating and clear that if I needed anything during my stay to give her a call. 

The room is on the fifth floor of a walk-up but for the size, price and location - it's tough to beat.[QWERTY123]The host canceled this reservation 36 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.[QWERTY123]Tina was a great host. Very welcoming upon arrival and regularly in touch before and during stay.

Apartment was ideal for my 10-night stay. Clean and had everything I needed. Apple TV was a nice bonus. Just 5-10 mins walk from Grand Central station. Lots of bars and restaurants around. Perfect for exploring the city.[QWERTY123]Tina was very welcoming, met us in person in the first night and gave us tips to go around New York. She texted once or twice a day to ensure things are going well with us. Bath tub was clogged in the first night and was fixed promptly the next day after notifying Tina.

It was a great experience staying at Tina's apartment.[QWERTY123]Enjoyed our stay at Tina's place.  Tina was great to work with.  Her place was as described in the listing.  Good location and everything you need to prepare your own food.  Look forward to staying there again on my next trip to NY.[QWERTY123]Tina was very communicative and texted me a couple of weeks before we headed to NYC. She met us to check in and was helpful with nearby restaurants and recommendations. She texted almost every day to see how things were going. She sounds like she's been booking her place for a while and is very meticulous about things; her booking requirements, cancellation policy, and additional cleaning fee should be noted.
We know we had to walk up stairs to get to her place on the 5th floor, but it was still exhausting every time! Loved AppleTV, you can definitely hear the traffic noise so light sleepers need earplugs. I noticed the shower head was really high so probably not ideal for petite/shorter people. Easy walk to Grand Central Station, Time Square, and Empire State Building, and small market on the corner is open 24/7.
Overall great experience with Tina, her apt, the neighborhood, and loved NYC![QWERTY123]Il nostro soggiorno nell'appartamento di Tina è stato piacevole.
L'appartamento corrisponde alle foto. Ci aspettavamo che fosse un po' più nuovo e curato (il letto aveva le molle molto rovinate e, sopratutto i primi giorni, si sentiva abbastanza puzza di fumo e un odore strano in casa). Ho amato particolarmente la zona soggiorno, con il bel divano, la poltrona in pelle e la Apple Tv per rilassarsi.
Buona posizione (meno di dieci minuti a piedi dalla Grand Central Station); ottimo poi il wifi gratis. In appartamento facevamo solo colazione ma, volendo, la cucina è abbastanza attrezzata per fare tranquillamente anche altri pasti.
La comunicazione con Tina è stata buona. A parte iniziali fraintendimenti, dopo esserci chiariti Tina è stata molto gentile e disponibile e, durante il nostro soggiorno, ci scriveva spesso per sapere se andava tutto bene.
Piccole annotazioni: le scale sono molte e ripide (Tina lo scrive chiaramente e quindi lo sapevamo!), portatevi valigie poco pesanti e comode da trasportare!!; il riscaldamento centralizzato funziona fin troppo bene (e non si può spegnere), dovevamo dormire con le finestre del soggiorno leggermente aperte nonostante la stagione! Il traffico è quello tipico di New York..Consiglio quindi dei tappi per le orecchie per il rumore e delle mascherine per gli occhi per dormire (le finestre non hanno gli oscuranti).
Nel complesso siamo stati soddisfatti!! Vale la pena provare a vivere in un vero appartamento newyorkese e, sicuramente, si ha a disposizione molto più spazio che in hotel..
[QWERTY123]Tina was very welcoming and made us feel at ease. She was also attentive during the stay.
The apartment is very well situated in a great location in Murray Hill.
The apartment is on the larger size for NYC places and is light, bright & airy. It is well equipped for a short or longer stay.[QWERTY123]Tinas Appartement war so wie beschrieben, es ist eine typische New Yorker Wohnung und auch schon etwas älter.
Die Lage war der perfekte Ausgangspunkt zu jedem Spot in Manhattan und man kommt sogar nach Brooklyn innerhalb max. 30 Minuten mit der Subway.

Tina war vor der Anreise und während des Aufenthaltes immer erreichbar und sehr hilfsbereit. 
Wir kamen später als geplant an, Tina war trotzdem da und hat uns die Wohnung in aller Ruhe gezeigt.

Gerne wieder![QWERTY123]Tina is a great host. She made the effort to meet us and even helped to carry our super heavy luggage up to her apartment which was 5 storeys high! Her apartment is clean and good flow of air. Even if the aircon has to be removed due to impending hurricane, it was comfy enough. The location of the apartment is also great, little distance from the main tourist area but hey! what's NYC without the sirens from ambulance and FDNY! Try staying there and you feel like a real New Yorker! Oh! And her bed was super duper comfy![QWERTY123]Tina fue muy amable al recibirnos y nos ayudó en todo lo que necesitamos. La localización del apartamento es inmejorable, es espacioso y tal como se describe  en el anuncio. Tuvimos la mala suerte de que justo en la semana en que estuvimos la cocina estaba estropeada, así que tuvimos que apañarnos solo con el microondas. Tampoco fue un gran problema y Tina dijo que ya había llamado para que vienieran a repararlo.

En general una experiencia muy positiva y recomendable.[QWERTY123]Tina was a great communicator and able to accommodate our wonky arrival and departure times. Her place was very comfortable and exactly as pictured. Thanks Tina![QWERTY123]Tina is great. She helped us with everything. The apt. is like being in a beautiful place with music and paintings. So warm. Perfect for 2.[QWERTY123]Tina is awesome and the place is so cute and cozy. Makes you feel like you're living in New York. It's walking distance to subway and close to bars and eateries as well as Starbucks. There is a cute deli downstairs, always open and delivers if needed. Its affordable and just perfect for two. Thanks Tina![QWERTY123]I had a great time at Tina ´s place. It is very charming, quite central, and has everything to accomodate a short stay in NYC. Communication was easy and Tina was super flexible with check in / check out, making the whole process very smooth.[QWERTY123]My trip was last minute and my flight was late as well but even after all these inconveniences, Tina was great, she was at the apartment on time. The apartment is at a good location. It is a decent sized clean apartment. I would recommend this place. Thanks Tina for everything ![QWERTY123]Fabulous apartment at a good price in a great location for experiencing mid-town Manhattan. I stayed at Tina's place for two weeks while in New York for work: she helped make my stay very comfortable, and wouldn't hesitate to recommend her apartment to others on AirBnB. Thanks Tina, and really hope to stay again some time :)[QWERTY123]The host canceled this reservation 7 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.[QWERTY123]We had a great stay at Tina’s place. Tina responded quickly to all of our questions from the beginning of our experience until the end. She was extremely accomodating as we arrived 2 hours before the check-in time that we had discussed and she came right over to check us in. She even helped us to carry our luggage upstairs.  She took the time to show us everything in the apartment that we may need and even offered us to use her personal things if we needed them. Don’t let the 5 floor walk-up scare you, my wife and I travelled up and down these stairs many times per day. My wife handled the stairs like a champ and she is nearing 6 months pregnant. We were also able to walk to Times Square and to many of the activities that we did during the trip. As long as you don’t mind a bit of a walk, the location is great. We enjoyed all of the exploring that we got to do along the way. There were also some great places to eat within a block or two.  Tina gave wonderful food and local recommendations that we tried and loved. We would definitely stay at Tina’s place again.[QWERTY123]Had a great week long stay. very friendly and responsive host that really made me feel welcomed. happy i didn't stay a hotel.[QWERTY123]The appartment is defenitely spacious and well located. Within walking distance to all the major attractions in midtown as well as the subway stations. Especially comfortable is the 103 Bus that is stopping right around the corner. GREAT NEIGHBOURHOOD! Chris herself is a very caring host. On arrival she gave us very suitable and helpful tips that made our stay even more perfect. Once again thank you soooo much! Your place is very well recommended by us!!!!!"	40.74767176908579	-73.97499733931186	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/5099	2	185.0	0.84
12	16458	"Sara's Park Slope home is the place to be should you be visiting NYC or the surrounding area. Stepping off the private elevator and into the brightly lit home brings a warmth to the bustling city. The spacious two-story home is well decorated, clean and has two outside areas to enjoy the sites and the sounds of the city. Our summer visit allowed us to enjoy the fresh garden where we started the day picking fresh berries and listening to the laughter of the children playing in the nearby park. Views of the Statue of Liberty and lower Manhattan skyline from this patio, took our breath away. 

The Park Slope neighborhood is vibrant day and night. A fresh market on the weekend allowed us to enjoy some neighborhood delicacies. However we cannot overlook Bagel World which started each day with a true New York size breakfast. The night life in Park Slope has a wide variety of restaurants and pubs, truly something for everyone. Getting around the city couldn't have been easier with multiple subway stops close by getting us into Manhattan in less than 20 minutes. Car services and Uber were plentiful and reasonable as well. 

Even though I never met Sara as she herself was on vacation, communications was open and we felt welcomed into her home even before we arrived. Sara will be my first call when I travel into the City again.[QWERTY123]Perfect place for to stay with children! Great location, well-appointed.[QWERTY123]This is a wonderful home at an incredible value.  The neighborhood is one of the best with amazing food options literally around the corner.  The apartment is amazing!!! Beautiful and spacious, with two wonderful outdoor spaces.  We felt so at home and would certainly stay here again when we return!  Don't think twice about coming to this amazing home.[QWERTY123]Sara's place was a great for our NYC needs. Plenty of room for 4 of us (2 parents & 2 teens) to spread out, and the views of the Statue of Liberty & Manhattan were great. It's right in between two subway stations, so it was easy to reach Manhattan. This was the first time we have stayed in a place where the hosts actually live (they were on vacation, so we were there instead of them, not with them), but their notes were helpful and we felt (Email hidden by Airbnb) munication was great prior to arrival, and we had 3-4 phone numbers to contact them if there had been any need (there wasn't!). It's not a full-time rental, but if Sara's dates line up with your dates, it's a great value...take advantage!"	40.67342578438242	-73.98337719092544	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/16458	4	225.0	0.9
13	5172	"Wonderful location--accommadations warm and friendly[QWERTY123]Very nice place and quiet[QWERTY123]Had a nice stay at Adrienne's apartment in Murray Hill.  I'd definitely recommend her place to friends.[QWERTY123]The apartment is very quiet and clean!  Very zen. And the bed is extremely comfortable.  We felt at home.  Parking nearby on 32nd btw 2nd and 3rd was very affordable.[QWERTY123]Adrienne's apartment is very nice and clean.  It is in a convenient location just blocks down from the subway. We had a very comfortable experience in her apartment![QWERTY123]Adrienne's place is superb! It is clean, comfortable and very cosy. Adrienne is also a delight to deal with. I would definately recommend her place.[QWERTY123]Adrienne was very helpful and informative for our stay. Unfortunately, illness got the best of us, and we were unable to make the trip but will definitely look for her place first when we reschedule our visit.[QWERTY123]Although i was unable to make the stay due to an injury, addrienne was kind enough to give me a credit. I look forward to staying there in March.[QWERTY123]Clean, centrally located, cozy and a great place to stay. Having lived in Manhattan I can say that I am more than pleased with my stay here. Adrienne is very easy to deal with and accommodating. Her apartment is a gem and I would stay here again without a doubt![QWERTY123]Great little place in a lovely neighborhood. Adrinne was very friendly and easy to talk to. She went out of her way to make sure we had everything we needed. We had a comfortable stay in her apartment.[QWERTY123]Adrienne, I have just seen your review and it surprises me how can you be so accurate when you were never there or never met you. What do you mean the apartment was not well kept? It is true I made the next guest wait, for approximately 40 minutes if I recall and I apologized to him, and it was time I spent cleaning for him. What do you mean the guest did not fit through the hallway? This has to be figurative speech because he did fit and left his stuff in the room while he went to buy groceries during that time. And again it wasn't late at night (6 or 7 P.M., the time the other guest was arriving doesn't constitute late at night, at least for the standards in my country). As it says below, you have to state the facts or at least get them right. I hope you got rid of the ant infection in the bathroom and kitchen, because it was very annoying. Apart from that everything was OK![QWERTY123]NA[QWERTY123]Adri was a wonderful host, she and her partners were very helpful and kind at all times. The flat is conveniently placed. Grand Central station really close and Empire State or Times Square at an easy 10-15 minutes walk more or less. Everything clean though bathroom a bit old. We missed a TV, nevertheless. Good value. Thanks Adrienne![QWERTY123]Adrienne was great at the initial contact, responded quickly when my other booking with AirBnB fell over. Really enjoyed staying in her apartment in Murray Hill. The place is small, but is a comfortable and quiet haven at the end of a busy NY day. The location is excellent too, and near some iconic NY landmarks. She is very generous, happy for guests to use her belongings. There is no TV, but hey, you don't go to New York City to watch television. Did not get to meet Adrienne directly, which was a pity, as she herself was away travelling. However, her friend Maria lives nearby, and was very helpful in Adrienne's absence. Thanks so much Adrienne, and best wishes to both of you![QWERTY123]A great host.  Everything came exactly as advertised.  Communicating with Adrienne and her friends was easy and reasonably quick.  Bruce M.'s comments below summarize our impressions well. 

There are some small outside costs, such as laundry pickup and dropoff, but worth the small effort as it keeps the overall cost down. Excellent value.  We would definitely stay again if the chance arises.

Thanks Adrienne![QWERTY123]Adrienne's apartment was a wonderful place to stay! The host was available most of the time we tried to contact her, and all of the accommodations promised were included. It was very close to many attractions and navigation was easy! I would definitely book this place again without hesitation.[QWERTY123]Très bien placé, à 3 blocks du métro à 7 min de grand central. Appartement confortable avec tout le nécessaire : draps, serviettes, alimentaire... Adrienne est  super sympa, accueillante et nous a sauvé d'une situation vraiment mal embarquée.[QWERTY123]Adrienne is a perfect host, he answered all the e-mails and graciously helped us in all. The house were as she said, the location is very good, it's a good place in Manhattan![QWERTY123]Probably the best one-bedroom apartment one could find! I slept there a lot more than I'd planned because the bed was just too comfortable. Rooms full of nice, inspiring decorations. Great location near Grand Central. Adrienne is a great host.[QWERTY123]Adrienne's apartment was wonderful. We had a pleasant stay, and the key pick-up and drop-off was very straightforward. Highly recommended.[QWERTY123]Cute apartment.  Great location.  Would definitely stay there again![QWERTY123]We enjoyed our stay here. The apartment was very clean and well maintained. We would definitely recommend this place to our friends.[QWERTY123]Adrienne was responsive and a pleasure to work with. Unfortunately, due to a family emergency, I was unable to keep my travel plans to NYC; however, my friend kept the reservations and informed me she  really enjoyed her stay at Adrienne's clean & cute apartment. When I plan my next trip, I would love to stay here! Thanks![QWERTY123]My first experience with airbnb and it couldnt have went any better.the location was central and just right. Adrienne go the extra mile to see that her guests are comfortable and settled in.

I felt like i was staying at a friend. I would recomend it ! Its the place i will stay always when in NYC[QWERTY123]Perfect host - ideal location, very quiet apt. close to everything.  Would definitely stay again.[QWERTY123]Adrienne's place was perfect! Small as she describes but very well organised and very good vibes to it! The bed was indeed very comfortable which is a definite plus when you have exhausting days around Manhattan (yes, shopping). I didn't get to meet Adrienne personnally since she was away (which is logical if you are renting her place), but picking up the keys and giving them back went smoothly and her friend Maria was very nice and helpful.

Would definitely try to book her place next time I come![QWERTY123]everithig was like Adrianne wrote. it is a small apartment but perfect for a couple (like us) or two good friends. perfect location! very old building but in a good and safe neighborhood. she was a perfect and very kind host, even we did not meet her. also her friend Maria, who was charged for the key exchange, was wery kind. 
we kindly recommend Adrianne as your host![QWERTY123]To begin with, this was my first time using the Airbnb Service and my first time in NYC. Adrienne's placed looked very warm and cozy in her photos and was priced the most economical for my budget. Setting up this reservation was very easy. Adrienne replied to my email and accepted my reservation. She called before my arrival to NY to confirm and went over the procedure for our stay. She was very helpful with information on how to get to her apartment from the airport and where to pick up her keys. Her apartment was located in the most welcoming area (to my experience) in New York. Her Murray Hill apartment was close to the metro station, markets, restaurants and bars. What you see in her photos is exactly what you see in her apartment. It is a cozy and welcoming apartment that it you never want to leave. I truly enjoyed my first experience with Airbnb and in NY because I was able to experience it like a local. In the mornings I cooked breakfast, made lunch for my outings, enjoyed a cup of coffee (which was complimentary on her behave) in the evenings. Adrienne left us a package of helpful information with maps, books, things to do in NYC etc. 
My boyfriend and enjoyed our stay in her apartment and look forward to returning to Murray Hill soon. Thank you Adrienne![QWERTY123]We had an excellent stay at Adrienne's. She is very friendly and her place is great. Would definitely stay there again.[QWERTY123]This place is centrally located, was able to walk most places that I needed to go. Very comfy bed (memory foam mattress). Great shower. Very clean. What else can you ask for?[QWERTY123]if you want someone bothering you about using too many towels then stay here .[QWERTY123]Adrienne's apartment is right in the middle of NYC, great location with convenient subway stops at 33rd and Grand Central. When we arrived a friend of Adrienne's met us at the apartment and showed us how to use the keys. The apartment is exactly as you see in the photos, with perhaps a couple extra pieces of furniture added. The radiator seems to be automatically on, so it does get a bit warm. We were able to regulate the temperatuer by opening the windows and, if needed, turning on the AC. The bathroom was clean and a good size for the city, the only comment is the pole in the corner gets really hot and it nearly burned me once. The water for the matter also gets VERY VERY hot very quickly. Adrienne was very helpful while we were in NYC despite not being in town herself; she responded quickly to emails asking for help (i.e. we couldn't find the log-in information for the wifi). There was a nice welcome package on the kitchen table with little bits of information about the city. The kitchen was a good size as well (for the city) and we were able to use the fridge.  Overall it was a perfect place for our trip to NYC and we will DEFINITELY try to use Adrienne's place next time!![QWERTY123]Adrienne's apartment was a pleasure to stay in. The bed is incredibly comfortable, the apartment is quiet, clean, centrally located, and the neighbors are friendly. Unfortunately I didn't have the opportunity to meet her but she was easy to reach and very helpful. Good vibes all around, I will definitely stay here again![QWERTY123]Fun little apartment in great location! Bed was super comfy and the apt was remarkably quiet. I had a great stay and would love to stay here again.[QWERTY123]Adrienne's apt was perfect for my NY trip. Her place is conveniently located and the atmosphere of her home is cozy and relaxing. She communicated with me clearly and worked hard to get me the keys when there were last minute conflicts with our travel plans.[QWERTY123]Nous avons passés une semaine dans cette appartement, il est très bien placé, très propre, le propriétaire est agréable et répond précisément et rapidement au mail, je recommande cette location qui est vraiment irréprochable.
We spent a week in this apartment, it is very well located, very clean, the owner is nice and responds quickly and accurately to the mall, I would recommend this holiday is really impeccable.[QWERTY123]Muy buena experiencia, todo estaba perfecto! El departamento tiene una ubicación muy buena y está muy bien puesto para 2 personas. Recomendable![QWERTY123]It was my first time with airbnb and the first time in Ney York as well. It was a wonderful experience and the apartment was pefect for our needs (my girfriend and mine).
In particular it was in a perfect position: silent and comfortable for visiting the city.
Even if we did not meet Adrienne, we found her very kind.
[QWERTY123]We stayed at Adrienne’s apartment over the Easter weekend – fabulous apartment, amazing location and all very convenient. Highly recommended. As other reviewers have pointed out earlier, the bed is very comfortable! Loads of good restaurants a short walk away and ideal for sightseeing in Manhattan. Much, much better than a hotel. While we did not meet Adrienne, she was very polite and quick to respond to emails - a very pleasant experience.[QWERTY123]Quiet slice of Manhattan sums it up.   This apartment is quieter than most NY hotels.   I enjoyed the garden views out back and slept like a baby in that comfortable bed.  I loved Adrienne's sticky notes placed around the apartment to help navigate the new environment, super helpful.  
Adrienne was a pleasure and always quick to respond via text or email.  A great value in the big apple.  
[QWERTY123]Adrienne's apartment was the perfect Manhattan location for us. It was a lovely and quiet refuge in a great walkable neighbourhood. Her helpful welcome package was an added bonus, and she was prompt and great with communications. We didn't want to leave![QWERTY123]Location, location, location!
Adrienne's place suited us perfectly. We appreciated  the air conditioning in the bedroom,  the comfy bed, the breakfast makings and also Perk  Cafe's letting us hand in our keys before opening time so we could get to the  airport  in time for our flight. We will recommend  Adrienne's place to our friends.[QWERTY123]I didn't meet Adrienne but the apartment was just as described and a nice place to be for my short stay. The bedroom backs onto the yard so is quiet. There is a nice character to the place and the bedroom-kitcken-bathroom setup had all that I needed.[QWERTY123]The apartment was just as described, wonderful location, very sweet place, though not much light. Adrianne was very kind and friendly on the phone. Make sure to ask Adrianne in the close-by key cafe' as in my case she wasn't sure I would get there on time, and left it at a 24h cafe' which was 22 blocks away.[QWERTY123]While I didn't get to meet Adrienne, she called me the afternoon we were checking in and we just missed each other! She put a lot of thought into making sure we had everything we needed and there were plenty of clean fresh towels and helpful notes. The space was big enough and a great location. I would recommend staying here.[QWERTY123]OH MY GOD LOCATION!!! Adrienne's place was an absolute delight. The size of it was cozy, and it had such a warm atmosphere to it. Me and my childhood best friend stayed at Adrienne's for a weekend in Manhattan and as two young women alone in a big city we never felt unsafe. The location was perfect. In New York you're going to be walking quite a lot, and Adrienne's place was just enough downtown that you felt like you were really getting the experience of the city that never sleeps but not too downtown that you didn't feel like it was your home to rest at, at the end of a long day. Only thing was we, personally, found that it was hot in the apartment at night, but having the window open while we slept fixed that right away! Adrienne's apartment had ANYTHING you might've forgotten to bring as well (we forgot to bring our blow dryer, and hair straightener). She really made us feel like we were staying at a home away from home. Adrienne was extremely kind, and responsive to all questions and enquiry's that we had. We will definitely be booking with Adrienne again when we decide to return back to this amazing city. Thanks for everything!![QWERTY123]Our stay was great. The apartment was clean and just enough space for my friend and I. Adrienne was even accommodating to our flight time for checkout.
I recommend for a quick weekend trip or if you need to been in town for a few days for business.[QWERTY123]The host canceled this reservation 17 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.[QWERTY123]We felt very welcome, she had it cleaned and instructions for anything that might go wrong available to us.[QWERTY123]Great location, ground floor apt (no schlepping) and perfectly fine accommodations.

The Bed gets a AAA+ bond rating.  Best ever in an ABB.
[QWERTY123]The host canceled this reservation 3 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.[QWERTY123]The apartment is located at a very central point in Manhattan. Great to explore the city. Very clean house, good contact with the owner,  smooth transfer with the keys. Good airco to cool the place. The owner left a map with information and a lot of things to do in New York. There only wasn't muts sunlight what made the apartment a bit dark. Also there was no space in a closet to put your stuff in.[QWERTY123]We found Adrienne's place to be a perfect spot for what we were looking for -  fantastic location (close to Grand Central Station made easy access to subways and LGA).  The size was more than comfortable for 2 people and it was clean as well as described and pictured accurately.  We spent a lot of time in other areas (Chelsea, West Village, East Village) as Murray Hill is very post graduate, young, etc but we could get to other areas with ease and come back to a safe, clean, affordable apartment in the middle of Manhattan![QWERTY123]Abbiamo trascorso un intera settimana a NY nell'appartamento di Adrienne. Nonostante non sia stato possibile incontrarci la comunicazione è stata ottima e di grandissimo aiuto: Adrienne è assolutamente presente anche quando non lo è fisicamente! L'appartamento è stato pulito il giorno prima del nostro arrivo da un servizio di pulizie perciò era assolutamente impeccabile. Il quartiere è assolutamente il migliore di NY: bar,ristoranti e pub sono a portata di mano ed anche i suggerimenti dell'host sono stati utilissimi. Appartamento assolutamente consigliato per chi viaggia solo o in coppia.[QWERTY123]My friend and I stayed at Adrienne's place recently. The location is good to all popular places. The subway is around 8 minutes walking, grocery store is around 4-5 min walking. Place is welcome, clean and really good so we were happy. Highly recommend![QWERTY123]The host canceled this reservation 2 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.[QWERTY123]La estancia en la casa de Adrienne ha estado muy bien, es una casa con todo lo necesario para vivir, esta a tres calles de la parada de metro y es una zona tranquila. Lo recomiendo[QWERTY123]Perrrrrfect stay at adriennes!!! 

It was a new York experience I have always dreamed of, honwstly.... Everything was the way I keep things so it felt like home, clean and cozy, colors & decor that I love on the walls, and else where books I enjoyed reading bits of, perfect water pressure, fluffy towels, comfortable bed, nice sheets, wood floors, I felt so secure even with no being used to the way the AC unit is set up, etc.... No televisions was
Even perfect but if a person can't go without there is WiFi with high speed connection

I could go on about how great my stay was[QWERTY123]Adrienne's place is wonderful. We stayed for 4 days and it was exactly as described: clean, central, and comfortable! I hope to be back soon and definitely will recommend it to anyone going to NYC. Thanks again Adrienne![QWERTY123]The location was in a very quiet location and everything seems to be very walking distance so it's great[QWERTY123]Adrienne's place is a wonderful place to stay just as in the pictures  It was very clean and she has it well organized (Website hidden by Airbnb) is in a great location and was close enough to walk to the United Nations Headquarters. The host Adrienne was great at communications and returned messages very quickly. We would definitely book her place again.[QWERTY123]This was a real find. Adrianne was very helpful. nice apartment, very useful for being near the UN on a budget. thanks Adrienne for making it possible for us to check out at 5am![QWERTY123]Great location!  Very quiet! Excellent value.

There's no TV and at times the Internet can be terribly slow but if you're out and about most days and nights, you'll hardly even notice (or care) :-)

Adrienne is friendly and communicative and was an excellent host.  Would definitely recommend.[QWERTY123]Adrienne's place is perfect! And you can not beat the location! Crosstown bus is around the corner and just a 5 minute walk to Grand Central. I was able to get around the city super easily. The place is obviously her actual home and not a hotel style environment. Which makes the atmosphere feel warm and welcoming. It's away from the street so it was very quiet at night. There was instant hot water in the shower too. I did not get to meet Adrienne directly, but her instructions for the key exchange was super simple. Thank you so much for hosting me! I will definitely look you up again in the future![QWERTY123]A fantastic apartment to stay in while exploring New York. Felt like a home away from home. It was quiet, great location to walk to trendy or tourist areas and the apartment had all the amenities you could wish for. Kitchen is fully functional, bathroom is kitted out and the bed was very comfortable. Adrienne was very accommodating with checkin and checkout and great at communicating quickly. I would certainly stay here again if I come back to New York.[QWERTY123]Adrienne is a great host!  She was very helpful and responsive to your questions even though we never meet face to face.  Her place is cute, cozy, clean and is in an great neighborhood in NYC.  We thought the location was perfect with everything you need nearby - just the kind of NY experience we were looking for.  We hope to go back again someday and spend more time.[QWERTY123]Adrienne’s place is really well located for those wanting to explore local attractions. It is walking distance to the UN, Empire State Building, Rockefeller Center, Chrysler Building, and Grand Central Station. Very easy to get around, and a very comfortable place to stay. Also, convenient key pick-up and drop-off through use of key cafe. Highly recommend.[QWERTY123]Adrienne was a great host. Super helpful and promptly answered any questions we had. The location itself is also very close to everything.[QWERTY123]Adrien is a very good host. The flat is Cosy and perfectly located to visit NY. I am recommending it.[QWERTY123]Great location. Ground floor entrance.
Lots of good places to eat nearby.[QWERTY123]Fantastic spot in Murray Hill. It truly is much bigger than it appears, comfy bed, and no complaints whatsoever. Would highly recommend[QWERTY123]Es justo lo que viene en la foto. Super buena atención limpio, céntrico, solo. No microondas y no tv.[QWERTY123]Adriennes place is very nice, and perfectly located to explore NYC. It was larger than expected, had a very comfy bed and all the amenities needed for a perfect stay. And the communication along the way was outstanding with very rapid responses to any questions. I highly recommend this place![QWERTY123]Place was fantastic.
Absolutely would recommend.

Location fantastic but still quiet.[QWERTY123]Cool accommodation. Nicely furnished. Though a little bit far from subway station.｢About ten minutes walk｣[QWERTY123]Adrienne's communication was fantastic and her place was so comfortable and convenient!  Everything was just as described and the location was perfect for getting anywhere (a short walk from Grand Central, and lots of restaurant choices, Trader Joe's, etc. right in the neighborhood).  The bed was superb (comfort of mattress, pillows, and linens) and the apartment itself was full of thoughtful touches and so peaceful - as it's on the back of the building all we heard in the evenings was birds going to sleep in the courtyard, and seeing green trees out the window was really refreshing.  Definitely the most peaceful nights I have ever had in NYC!  Key pickup and drop off from a lockbox was secure and convenient.  I can't recommend Adrienne highly enough as a hostess.[QWERTY123]Adrienne is an immensely considerate, thoughtful and helpful host. She is extremely communicative and quick to reply if any issues arrive. She also goes above and beyond what is normally expected in ensuring that guests feel completely at home (even including a small box of emergency toiletries in case guests have forgotten any!). The apartment is very good value considering the excellent location and the space it provides. All in all, I recommend this apartment extremely highly![QWERTY123]We enjoyed our stay in this centrally located apartment, which is very quiet and has an excellent bed.    It was very clean and had all the amenities we needed.  It is also an excellent value.  Adrienne was able to accomodate our last minute request to come a day early and was easy to communicate with.  FYI the key pick up is about 8-9 blocks away, so plan a little extra time for that when you arrive and depart.  The only negative  is that there is little natural light, at least in the summer, as it is a ground floor apartment.  However we were out and about during the day, so it was not a problem for us.[QWERTY123]My boyfriend and I stayed here for a total of 9 days on a big NYC trip for the summer. The location of Adrienne’s place is phenomenal. It is central to all major attractions and subway stations. It is also a safe area and very homey. Bed is very comfortable and considering this is New York it is actually great space for two-three people. The place is very clean and very well priced. Adrienne answers promptly and is a great resource for suggestions on anything to do in the city. There are restaurants and even a washeteria nearby if needed. The WiFi works very fast as well. I definitely plan on staying here again in the future.[QWERTY123]Great space! Quiet, in the back of the building. Also a good location in the middle of the city for tourists.
Adrienne was very responsive and helpful with checking in and out.
There is a great smoothie/sandwich/salad/coffee place around the corner, on 1st Ave.[QWERTY123]Quiet calm clean. We had a very nice stay[QWERTY123]Todo correcto. Buena ubicación y buena comunicación con el anfitrión[QWERTY123]logement idéal pour un séjour au centre de Manhattan, proche du métro, des commerces et des lieux à visiter. Tout est bien , seul petit défaut de l'appartement lié au rez de chaussée sur cour, il fait sombre mais on n'est pas souvent à l'intérieur pendant la journée.
En résumé, prêt à y retourner.[QWERTY123]The location is great, also the key pick-up and drop-off via keycafe is quick and convenient. The apartment is quiet and the bed, pillows & towels are very comfortable. All in all a 5/5 experience and I would recommend Adriennes apartment unconditionally to everyone visiting New York.[QWERTY123]A really cosy place in a great location for midtown/ Grand Central. Adrienne was helpful and easy to deal with."	40.74495768021798	-73.97420099761759	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/5172	2	129.0	0.822222
14	16595	"Daniel is wonderful and so was his place. The neighborhood was very quiet and is a great place if you have some work to do. If you have an issue or a problem Daniel will get back to you quickly and he is very considerate.[QWERTY123]Daniel has a great place in a superb spot in Williamsburg (a fantastic suburb!) - his place is very cozy, yet roomy and stylishly laid out with all the amenities we could need. Daniel himself was very helpful, informative and friendly, we very much enjoyed our stay and would highly recommended to all!![QWERTY123]Excelente mi primera experiencia con Airbnb.Daniel es un anfitrión genial,pendiente de nuestras necesidades y que acudió enseguida que lo necesitamos por algún problema en el uso de a (Website hidden by Airbnb) casa era exactamente como se describía y Daniel la ha decorado de una manera muy acogedora y agradable,tiene muy buena energía.Además me encantó la escalera de incendios,donde se puede salir a charlar o a respirar aire fresco (bien abrigado por supuesto).
En cuanto al barrio ,para mí es otro de los puntos fuertes;  nos encantó Williamsburg (lleno de bares y locales con música en directo) y la gente que se movía por allá.Además está supercerca de Manhattan (a sólo una parada de metro del Lower East Village) y puedes desplazarte fácilmente en taxi (unos 7 dólares hasta el East Village).Seguramente me quedaré toda la estancia en esta zona la próxima vez que vuelva a NY ,ya que esta vez partimos nuestra estancia entre Brooklyn y East Village.
Sólo un dato como comentario , la escalera del edificio es bastante vieja y puede dar una fasa impresión sobre la casa al principio.Recomiendo esperar hasta ver la casa para poder emitir un juicio,ya que no tiene nada que ver con el estado del edifio.

Me ha encantado mi experiencia en Williamsburg,la hemos disfrutado mucho.[QWERTY123]My parents stayed at Daniel's place during their weekend visit to NYC.  The apartment was lovely and serene, and Daniel was accommodating and easy-going. I'd recommend Daniel's apartment to anyone looking for a place to stay in Williamsburg![QWERTY123]Daniel's place was perfect and right where we wanted to be in Brooklyn. His apt. is nicely put together and had a great atmosphere. His attention to detail can't be missed. Daniel was very easy to work with and I'm glad everything worked out. Lots of bars, restaurants and shops in close proximity. Highly recommend his loft for a great NYC experience.[QWERTY123]Daniel has a beautiful apartment in a fantastic location. I live in the area and had a group of visiting friends stay there. We spent the entire weekend within walking distance of the apartment and had a blast. Breakfast at Pies-n-Thighs and Rabbit Hole, Stumptown coffee at Marlowe & Sons, lunch at Fette Sau, dinner at Traif, beer and bratwurst at Radegast, bowling at Brooklyn Bowl, and so much more we didn't have time for. I highly recommend staying here.[QWERTY123]We've spent a wonderful week at Daniel's place ! The apartment is really nice, cozy and comfortable. You will feel at home. The neighborhood is quiet and close to a lot of nice bars and restaurants. And Daniel is very friendly. 
We highly recommend Daniel's place ![QWERTY123]Place was great, just like on the pics.
Daniel was really nice, we had a problem with the Wifi, but He addressed the issue promptly which was great.
I would definitely recommend the place to other people.[QWERTY123]Great apartment. Very helpful owner. We needed something last minute and it all came together.[QWERTY123]Daniel was great. He was helpful and a good communicator. His apartment is beautiful apartment, just as the pictures show and the location is fantastic, close to lots of great bars and restaurants. I would stay again.[QWERTY123]Daniel’s place was quite cozy and looks like the pics. I’d recommend his place if ur in the area. It’s pretty close to some good eats like pies and thighs and the Brooklyn flea market/smorgasbord. The neighbourhood is pretty safe too. Subway is about a 10 minute walk to the closest one and the stairs are creaky but still a great spot. I'd book his loft again.[QWERTY123]Daniel was a great host.  The loft was just as advertised.  Very clean, sunny, spacious and a great location.  I would love to stay there again.[QWERTY123]Very nice apartment in very hip, trendy neighborhood. Clean, sunny, stylish, 5-7 minutes walk to Bedford Avenue, and about 20-25 min by metro to 42nd Street. 

Might be very hot during the summer months, but Daniel (the host) is planning to install AC. 

Daniel was very helpful and responded very fast to all enquires.

If I'll travel to NY in the nearest future, I'll definitely try to book this apartment again. 

[QWERTY123]Daniel's place was perfect!  Great location and cozy little apartment (even had some beers and munchies for my consumption after a late flight in from Chicago).

Getting into the place was a cinch and Daniel was super responsive even when, at the last minute, I needed to stay an extra night.  Would definitely stay here again.[QWERTY123]thanks for making our stay happen last minute!
nice place, good neighbourhood & excellent restautants & cafe's nearby.
& now with aitconditioning! :)[QWERTY123]Daniel's pad is a well-polished gem buried beyond a gritty street-front and crumbling hallway.  

Four of us spent three nights in scorching July, but with a window AC unit humming it was a comfortable launching point for both Brooklyn and Manhattan.  There's an unassuming diner with top-notch fare around the corner and  Marcy station is a five-minute walk away. 

Daniel himself is a great absentee host, setting up an easy check-in/check-out system and responding quickly to any questions or concerns.  He even offered a discount after an issue with the deadbolt necessitated a visit from a locksmith.  

Highly recommended.[QWERTY123]I was very happy with the service and communication by Daniel.  The apartment is very clean and spacious by New York standards.  Checking in and checking out was very easy.  Highly recommend dealing with Daniel.[QWERTY123]I enjoyed my stay!  Clear communication from Daniel, who was quick to respond to all inquiries and it's a great place.[QWERTY123]I just loved Daniel´s place! Wouldn´t hesitate to go again.[QWERTY123]Great place - comfortable, close to a couple of subways (L and J / M) and nice places to eat and grab coffee. Daniel was helpful and friendly too. I'd recommend it.[QWERTY123]Daniel was the perfect host, very flexible and really went out of his way to make our stay as good as possible! The apartment is fantastic with air-condition and everything. Close to both restaurants and subway. Highly recommended![QWERTY123]Daniel is such an amazing guy. He helped with everything about the apartment, with fast answers and flexible terms.

Needed to check-in a little bit earlier than the combined, and there was no problem for him.

There's a cafe near called ""Marlow & Sons"" that is totally incredible. The train is also near. Great localization and neighborhood.

The apartment is pretty exactly the pictures, the only thing to tell about it is the stairs of the building, that are kinda old.

If I visit NYC again, I'd totally stay again at his place.

Everything was amazing.[QWERTY123]Very sunny and spacious, good communication from Daniel and an easy check in and out process. Pretty good location, a short walk to the JMZ stops and easy stroll into the main part of Williamsburg. It worked well for us as one couple and a friend we had the bedroom and the third person had a bed in the main space. The desk by the window is a good spot to work from.[QWERTY123]Everithing was  very good!!![QWERTY123]this was my first experience with AirBnB and it was a great one![QWERTY123]Good experience overall.  Daniel is responsive and the getting the keys and getting into the loft went off without a hitch. Easy walk to the subway stop.[QWERTY123]It's just a great place after you managed to get around the staircase. And Daniel is fast and perfect in addressing all the questions we had. One important note: make use of the Northside Luxury Taxi Service as it is reliable, cheap and comfortable.[QWERTY123]Everything was as advertised! We had a great stay.... Very easy process.[QWERTY123]Unfortunately when we arrived at 4pm on Halloween the apartment hadn't been cleaned despite the fact that I had confirmed my arrival and was told that the cleaner would be there from 12-3pm that day. The apartment had been inhabited by a group of very messy people who left a lot of rubbish, mess and wet towels on the bathroom floor and the smell wasn't very pleasant. When I contacted Daniel he responded immediately and sent the cleaner over to the apartment. She started while we were dressing up to go out amongst all the mess and took the laundry. When we arrived home later that night the apartment was in order. They said it was a mistake and hadn't happened before. I asked for the cleaning fee to be refunded to me and Daniel agreed. So, I was happy with how Daniel dealt with the situation but it was not such a good stay for us because of what happened and I felt it was a bit over-priced. Also the neighbours upstairs thumped around a lot.[QWERTY123]Very nice appartment, just as described. Daniel was very responsive and quickly answered any question by e-mail. It was a treat to return to this nice loft after a long day out. Little noise and no problem to sleep with the bedroom window open. 

The neighbourhood is lively, fun and safe. Manhattan is very easy accessible through the bedford avn and Marcy st Metro stations some minutes walk away. We rented bikes for a day at the bike shop in bedford avn. just after the bridge, brought them with us on the east ferry and had a nice ride along the Hudson river to Central park and then across Manhattan to east river and Williamsburg. Recommended.

[QWERTY123]Daniel was amazing to work with!  He is quick at returning emails and was happy to answer all of my questions before I booked his apartment.  His space is immaculately clean and has tons of room to spread out and feel at home away from home. 

The thing that that most impressed me is Daniel's laid back attitude; during our stay a lamp was broken.  He was very quick to let us know the cost for replacement and was understanding about the situation.

Wonderful place to stay in Williamsburg![QWERTY123]Daniel's Loft suited us well.  As two professionals in the city for meetings and doing some work from ""home"" the space and location was perfect.  We loved trying a new restaurant for every meal - too many to choose from in Williamsburg and made use of the very efficient kitchen to cook in a couple of times.  

The loft is an easy metro ride or drive to Manhattan and a quick walk to trendy Bedford Ave. Easy from JFK and even closer to La Guardia airports.  

I hope to stay here again and would certainly recommend to friends and/or family.[QWERTY123]I enjoyed my stay at Daniel's apartment. It has a lot of style: the antique unique furniture and light fixtures, the brick wall, comfortable kitchen, beautiful middle eastern rugs, a library... Everything about it tells of the rare and unique opportunity of staying at one of the hippest places you've ever visited -of Williamsburg Brooklyn.[QWERTY123]Daniel was a great and very responsive host. The pictures of his place are identical to what it looks like in person.[QWERTY123]Daniel's apartment was everything we could have wished for on our trip! The apartment was really well equipped and finished to a very high standard- some lovely art books and mags were lovely finishing touches. The beds were comfy, linen- fresh and towels fluffy- GREAT to not have all this here and ready for us on arrival. Milk, teas and coffees were much appreciated after our long journey and the kitchen had everything we needed... a total luxury! The bathroom was clean and I will truly miss the fabulous shower!  

The location was excellent... right by the Williamsburg bridge and only a couple minus walk from Bedford Avenue.  The area was safe, and felt like a second home to us.  We are hoping to return as soon as we can and this would certainly be my first port of call.  Staying in Brooklyn felt like we were part of a community and we were only a couple of stops on the Metro from Manhattan.  Absolutely perfect!

Many Thanks to Daniel and for making us feel so at home!  We hope to see you again soon.

Becky ad Jon, Brighton UK[QWERTY123]love the loft! everything was easy no hassles...[QWERTY123]Daniel's place was perfect for me and my four friends. It's location couldn't be better; it's halfway between the Marcy and Bedford subway stations, giving you easy access to the L, J and M lines running to Manhattan. Secondly, Marlow & Sons and Diner are just around the corner and offer some of the best elevated casual fare in Williamsburg. If you're into shopping, there's plenty just around the corner--namely, Brookfarm General Store and Hickoree's--and even more closer to the main drag of Bedford Ave. Daniel was a very communicative and accomodating host. It was important for us to check in early and slightly late and Daniel worked with us both times to make that happen--thanks! As for the apartment itself, it's clean and lovely. To be honest, we didn't spend much time there, but what time we did was very much enjoyed.[QWERTY123]The place was very nice, simple to access, perfect neighborhood, and the communication with Daniel was very easy too.

Very nice experience ![QWERTY123]The loft was just as described. Very spacious, clean, and comfortable beds for all! Easy access to metro and short ride to Manhattan. Neighborhood was quiet at night. Daniel replied promptly to our questions and we were able to check-in and out with ease.[QWERTY123]Daniel is a perfect host and the apartment is great. The location is perfect, close to Marcy Avenue (Subway Station) and Bedford Street. A lot of good restaurants, bars and shops nearby. 

The apartment was clean and felt safe. We would love to stay here again!


[QWERTY123]Daniel's apartment in Williamsburg is beautiful, clean and welcoming, loved the decor, the beds were all comfortable and the kitchen well equipped for the few family meals we decided to prepare when the kids got tired of french fries... A big plus is the location - close to nice deli's, bars and groceries yet still quiet enough a neighborhood, not too far from the bus and subway. Unfortunately we did not get to meet Daniel, though our few phone calls were pleasant, and when we experienced some difficulties with the internet it was solved immediately. A perfect home away from home for us!
This was also our first encounter with airbnb - and it was quite nice![QWERTY123]Daniel's apartment is absolutely gorgeous! Easy check-in and check-out process w/ the keys to boot.[QWERTY123]Daniel's apartment is beautiful, spacious, clean and welcoming after you managed to get around the staircase. The apartment is cozy and looks like the pics. Williamsburg is an edgy and upcoming neighborhood with lots of good shops, galleries and cafes like Marlow & Sons .Easy access to metro (L and J / M) and short ride to Manhattan. Daniel himself is helpful and was very responsive and quickly answered any question by e-mail.[QWERTY123]Daniel's place was absolutely perfect, we were five girls staying for a total of 9 night. The apartement was spacious, clean and a big part of making our New York experience complete. We were provided with enough towels for all of us and the beds were comfy. 

Daniel was overall a perfect host, also big thanks to Christine who helped us find our way aound the area. Would highly recommend this apartement, the location is really good, close to downtown manhattan and close to the heart of Williamsburg.

We would definetly stay there again![QWERTY123]It was a pleasure to live in this apartment. We were a family of 4 (2 adults and 2 children) and place was perfect. The neighborhood is very nice and the atmosphere of williamsburg, a treat!! strongly advise!!! .... Pascal and his family[QWERTY123]Amazing apartment and great location. Just as advertised -- meaning it's a full on experience. Would love the opportunity to stay here and would recommend it to anyone else.

One small thing to note: the bedroom gets slightly stuffy when the summer humidity and heat get up. The windows and breeze are great otherwise. And there's always the A/C unit.[QWERTY123]The place was awesome, easy to access, fantastic location, and Daniel was very helpful too.

We will be back ![QWERTY123]fantastic, spacious, well-designed, comfortable space.  rare in NYC to have a whole floor with beautiful natural light flowing from both directions.  especially in this neighborhood and for this price.  also nice to not have a TV.  if you want to watch movies, projector is perfect and cinematic.  good coffee and restaurants within a block.  check out Marlowe and Daughters/Sons for delicousness.  and Pies & Thighs is only 3 blocks up and to the left.  forgeddaboutit.[QWERTY123]Daniel's loft is a great place to plan and start your NY visit from. It is furnitured with a lot of love for details and antiques. The kids enjoyed sitting at the front window and watching traffic go by. It was great to have a table seating all of us for dinner and breakfast. We did not get in touch with Daniel, but everything (keys, Wi-FI access etc.) was well prepared. The area is the ""cooler part"" of W-burg including great restaurants around the corner as well as dirt and trash on the streets.[QWERTY123]Daniel's apartment was great. Nice and breezy, beautifully furnished and in a great location for exploring.  Caught the Brooklyn Brewery tour and used the City Bikes to ride into Manhattan over the Williamsburg bridge and return via the Brooklyn bridge. Thanks for coming thru when another AirBnber failed us.[QWERTY123]Daniel's place was wonderful.  Tastefully appointed, easy to access, comfortable. It's near well-reviewed restaurants like Diner and Marlow & Sons, and a great cup of coffee can be had just up the street at Gourmet Guild. A ten minute walk to the subway makes it easy to zip into the city. Great experience, overall.[QWERTY123]Daniel’s loft was very comfortable and spacious. We enjoyed spending a few days there and recommend it.[QWERTY123]I loved my time in this super clean and comfortable apartment and really enjoyed the area,  I will definitely stay here again.[QWERTY123]This is just the perfect place for your New York visit! You find yourself right close to the waterfront facing Manhattan without all the noise and trouble you might want to escape after your long days. Nice restaurants and coffee places in easy walking distance and -what we appreciated very much -the east-river ferry boats leaving just around the corner from Daniels apartment. Although very close to Williamsburg bridge, it´s amazingly quiet. And nicely furbished, easy to feel comfortable and home here. I guess we will be back ![QWERTY123]We loved staying in Daniel's loft. It is so nicely decorated, clean and was very comfortable. It is also ideally located to fully experience Williamsburg and there are so many options around for coffee, drinks and food. We had a great stay and would definetly recommend it!
[QWERTY123]I have just returned from staying in this flat for 9 days, we really enjoyed our time there.  It was very well equipped, clean and homely.  Also well placed for the subway, two stations within easy reach.  The local shops and restaurants were also an easy stroll away.  The East River ferry stopped 2 minutes walk away.  It was lovely to come home to after a hectic day on Manhattan and I would definitely recommend it.[QWERTY123]Daniel's loft was a lovely place to stay for my family. We had plenty of room and only a short walk to the subway. There were some good eating places close by and we felt very secure in the apartment. The only downside is the lack of laundry facilities in the apartment, however a laundromat was only a short walk.[QWERTY123]We enjoyed our stay very much.
The apartment is compact but fine for our family of four. Loved the way that every ounce of space was used to advantage & the location was perfect for exploring the area. We all loved Williamsburg with its small bars & galleries. The apartment was just as the pics showed & lived up to our expectations. We would definitely stay here again, so thank you Daniel. It was hard to leave.[QWERTY123]We had a wonderful stay! Daniel was very responsive. We were happy with the location and street parking availability!  The apartment was very clean, organized and nicely decorated. It exceeded our expectations and we would definitely consider staying here again![QWERTY123]We were pleased to be in there. Daniel and friends are really kind to us, and accept our late-check out with our luggages, too. The place was also nice, mostly. comfy and beautiful.[QWERTY123]This was a fantastic place to stay, the area is so fun with lots of cafes, restaurants, bars etc nearby. The apartment is airy, warm and really quiet, I would definitely recommend staying here. The owner is really lovely to deal with too.[QWERTY123]Although we didn't meet Daniel, he was very prompt in answering our reservation request and gave us all the information we needed to reach  the apartment and to enjoy our stay there. The apartment is as shown in the pictures, it is clean and warm. It is well positioned very close to the J and M train station and 10/15 minute walk far from the L station if you want to visit Manhattan. It is also near the nicest restaurants and cafes in the neighborhood, which is very safe. I was there with two friends and the apartment was perfect for us with three separate beds arranged between the bedroom and the living room. I would definitely stay here again.[QWERTY123]I had a great time staying at Daniel's Airbnb. The location was great and there was a grocery store and plenty of restaurants in the neighborhood.[QWERTY123]Extremely fast response to a last minute request from me to stay. Daniel was flexible with the check in time and everything was as it was described. Very clear instructions about the apartment which is great. The place is close to some great restaurants and bars and right where I wanted to be.[QWERTY123]As advertised. In excellent part of town. Close to some good joints. A short hop over to Manhattan. Nicely appointed. Will stay again.[QWERTY123]Daniels Apartment was Amazing!!!! Plenty of space, lots of hot water and really nice neighbors. The place was really clean and populated with great vintage furnishings. AC worked perfectly on the extremely hot NYC days i was there. The breeze coming from the windows on both sides of the apartment was enough to cool down the place in minutes after being closed up all day as well. Its close proximity to the Subway made it really easy to get in and out of the city and the shops and restaurants in the neighborhood are some of the best in Williamsburg. 
Try the Dodge City Salami at Marlow and Daughters.[QWERTY123]This was an amazing find! I had to find a place last minute due to an unexpected cancellation, and Daniel was incredibly responsive.

The apartment is in a great part of town, walking distance to restaurants, bars, markets and the subway. There was plenty of space and it was very charming. Daniel provided a thorough guide to the space (how to get the keys, info about check-out, etc.), which was very helpful and appreciated.

My only complaints were really out of Daniel's hands: the weather was really, really hot, and the apartment took a while to cool down from the small A/C unit, and the WiFi was extremely spotty, often not working at all (Daniel contacted the cable company, and they said they had an outage, but it never resolved).

Other than that, I would absolutely stay here again — amazing find![QWERTY123]Not much to say other than the Apartment was great. Just as petty as the pictures and excellent location - was so easy just to stroll down to the best places in Williamsburg. Do. It.[QWERTY123]Daniels very quick to respond to mails. The apartment is in a great location for restaurants and bars. Do a right and head right along Wythe and your all set for the evening. Its an easy hop over to Manhattan on the ferry. I would recommend this for a short break in NYC.[QWERTY123]This place was so charming and really treated us with love. Daniel is a joy and very helpful, he was very ready to help me when I had some things to sort out. Thank you Dan![QWERTY123]Daniel's place is beautiful and really well taken care of.  He was quick with communication and the AirBnB pictures and description were very accurate - the space actually seemed a little bigger in person.  We were really comfortable with 3 people and the AC worked great when it was too hot for open windows.  The location was nice, practically under the Williamsburg bridge, which is unique in a good way (and it's far enough that you don't hear any traffic).  The neighbourhood seemed really safe at all hours and had cool cafes and bars nearby.

Recommended.  We were all really happy there!

Thanks Daniel.[QWERTY123]Had an awesome stay at Daniels apartment. There was 3 of us comfortably living there for 5 days. We never met Daniel in person but he was on email if ever we needed anything and checking in was really simple. The apartment is exactly as it looks in the pictures and reads in description (Stunning). Williamsburg I would say is the best place to stay in NY and the flat is positioned close to the subway and within walking distance to all the local coffee shops/ bars/ restaurants and retail shops. I can also say the neighbourhood is very safe. If I had to say a negative about the venue it would have to be the fact it didn't have an elevator but lucky for me I was with 2 strong men otherwise I wouldn't have managed to get my huge suitcase up 2 flights of stairs. Other than that we had a great time and would highly recommend staying here and would definitely stay again. :)[QWERTY123]We booked Daniel's Williamsburg apartment for 4 nights.  It is very conveniently about a 10 minute walk to the subway.  Lots of good restaurants and coffee shops close by.  Felt safe walking around at night.  The view of Manhattan from the river was awesome.  

The apartment was very nice.  We felt like we were coming ""home"" after a long day of walking around the city.  It has all of the creature comforts you might want and was nice for just hanging out around the kitchen table.  The beds were a little hard for our tastes, but it wasn't horrible.  

To get to the apartment on the third floor, you do have to walk up two flights of pretty narrow stairs, but it's New York, that's to be expected. 

Overall, great, convenient, clean, and welcoming.  Check in was super easy and the House Manual is very specific as to how the apartment should be maintained and left when checking out.  

Thanks for a good week in NY, Daniel!  

[QWERTY123]We had a great stay in Daniel’s charming apartment. Loved the neighborhood. Great places for food nearby and the East River Ferry took us straight to Manhattan![QWERTY123]Daniel's apartment was perfect for our stay. It was exactly as pictured and in a lovely location. Plenty of space for our group of 3 and Daniel made it very easy for checking in and out and was very quick in responding to any communications.[QWERTY123]Although we did not met, Daniel was super reactive and it was easy to access the appart even landing late. Convenient location. Convenient appartment well described. We get what we rented. Thanks[QWERTY123]My stay at Daniel's place was enjoyable. The apartment was much larger than I expected. A very walkable neighborhood with lots of shops and restaurants nearby. I recommend checking out the Urban Market around the corner on Broadway. Easy access to lower Manhattan via the East River Ferry (5 minute walk).[QWERTY123]Daniel was a very welcoming and responsive host. Guidelines were easy enough to follow.

The apartment was generally as described and depicted, though the building exterior/stairwells are in generally poor condition. The interior was clean, tidy and functional. The shower/tub is very small, to the point that you stick to the sides of the shower curtain while showering. Overall, though, the space is very livable and comfortable. 

As of this writing, there is also construction ongoing in the adjacent building which creates heavy worker traffic on the street. 

The neighborhood is very cool -- sits right on the southern edge of Williamsburg -- so heading south lands you in Hasidic neighborhoods and heading north or east outs you smack into trendy 'burg country with countless shops/restaurants/bars within easy walking distance.

I would have really enjoyed my stay here overall much more, however, if it weren't for a major problem with the upstairs neighbors and their noise level. It is very loud, obnoxious and constant. Daniel is very aware of the issue, and has assured me that he rectifying the problem -- as it is apparently a new problem - but I would be remiss to not mention it as it directly and negatively impacted the enjoyment of my stay.

If you are here to work, or you need to rest/sleep during normal hours, please check w Daniel to make sure this problem is not ongoing.

My trip ended up concluding earlier than expected, and Daniel was kind enough to refund my unused portion of the trip to me in full, which I really appreciated.

In summary -- positives: great host, cool location, fun neighborhood, comfortable quarters; negatives: busy construction area, obnoxious neighbors.[QWERTY123]Cosy elegant stay in Williamsburg. pretty close to anything you'd need in a quiet part of the neighberhood.[QWERTY123]Our apt location was excellent, very near restaurants and other other Williamsburg sites.  The apt was cozy and exactly as described by Daniel.  The hallway and stairs are pretty rundown as is common in these older buildings, but the apt was a great place to unwind after a busy day.  We felt very safe in the neighborhood, day and night.  I would recommend Daniels place when looking for a great Williamsburg location![QWERTY123]A short walk from the J and M. Check-in was set up very conveniently, could do it at any time without bothering the host, which I appreciated. 

It's a very nice, well-decorated space to relax in with tall ceilings. The walls are a little thin, but I would definitely stay in again.

Stayed for 5 nights.[QWERTY123]The host canceled this reservation 8 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.[QWERTY123]Loved this place just south of the Williamsburg Bridge. Proper warehouse feel and put together with love and taste by Daniel. The neighbourhood doesn't need any explanation probably and links to Manhattan and other parts of the city are great. All communications from Daniel were prompt and chilled. Highly recommended.[QWERTY123]This is a good spacious ""loft"" style place.  Handy location for Williamsburg. It's clean and characterful and Daniel was helpful.
A great spot if Williamsburg is your preferred destination.
[QWERTY123]Daniel was a very nice and informative host. We felt very welcome with clear instructions of how to manage get into the building. It felt safe and easy. The apartment was clean and silent, close to nice bars and shops in Williamsburg. It was really easy to catch the train into Manhattan and also further out in Brooklyn.
We also loved the food court down the road, with very fresh and nice offers!

Thanks for a nice stay![QWERTY123]Daniel was very responsive and had us over on very short notice. As described multiple times the neighborhood is great with its hip bars and restaurants (there's even a Michelin rated one - Delaware and Hudson). The apartment is located two minutes away from a ferry which is very convenient to go to lower Manhattan (great views of the Brooklyn bridge) and a 10 minutes walk to the metro line M.
The apartment itself looks as on the pictures, it's very charming and spacious  however during summer the temperature is u-n-b-e-a-r-a-b-l-e, especially in the bedroom area as the AC is on the other side of the apartment. Apart from that it's  good value for money.[QWERTY123]Great apartment, exactly as described. Would visit again[QWERTY123]Place is really kept well and exactly as the photos show.  Daniel was very helpful and always would get back to messages very promptly.  I'd definitely recommend anyone to stay at this place.[QWERTY123]nice cozy place in a great locale.  will be on my wish list for next trip.[QWERTY123]Beautiful place. Tasteful, welcoming. A pleasure to be there. Great supermarket only a block away. Nice neighborhood near the river. Daniel was helpful and clear. Only drawbacks are the building's rundown narrow stairs (but you forget them as soon as you enter the loft) and only one AC unit. We happened to be there in extremely hot and humid days in August and took a while to bring the temperature down. All in all we had a fantastic time. Would definitely come back.[QWERTY123]A charming apartment, Very satisfied with my stay. Daniel was a great host assertive and quick with responding to queries. 

The space consisted of an organically vintage stylised work/living area and all amenities  were included. 

The area was as close to Williamsburg bride as they come. I enjoyed the local supermarket aswell as Bedford ave as a whole. 

My baby niece hung out during the day and was easily entertained in her self made bed sheet tent whilst watching cartoons on the projector. 

Would defiantly recommend this apartment. Ps make sure you do your dishes, do not move anything around  & check to see if there are stains anywhere before resting up, to avoid a bad review x 



[QWERTY123]The host canceled this reservation 2 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.[QWERTY123]Great place![QWERTY123]easy check in, great location, beautiful apartment. would stay again :)[QWERTY123]Nice Brooklyn Location, big space for NYC, well fitted apartment.[QWERTY123]Had a great experience at Daniel's place, I highly recommend staying here.[QWERTY123]This place is perfect - I was here for work as well as catching up with friends. Daniel was a pleasure to connect with and everything was set and simple. The place is an oasis in a rather hectic city and the location for me was perfection. Yoga, restaurants, shops, wine store, grocery and on and on. Stay here you wont regret it. The style of the home and the size for the location are unbeatable.[QWERTY123]Amazing flat. Perfect area. Lovely host.[QWERTY123]Amazing space, tastefully decorated and very quiet. Better than crowded North side of Williamsburg...  Loved it![QWERTY123]Place worked well for our purposes. Thanks![QWERTY123]This apartment is a well-furshished loft with cute Mid-Century-Modern furniture. It's a big place. I stayed by myself and felt it was very spacious. I didn't get a chance to use the projector. There is a bit of noise from the street but I've lived elsewhere in the city so it didn't bother me. I appreciated the dining table where I could work. 

Bathroom and shower are fine, no complaints. Check-in was quite easy.  Great place for a couple or a couple plus one.[QWERTY123]So easy...and clean...and perfect. Beautiful apartment in a fabulous location. Easy clear check-in check-out. Love to return there![QWERTY123]The host canceled this reservation 3 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.[QWERTY123]Daniel's place is beautifully decorated!! So happy my family got the chance to stay in the area and check out more of Williamsburg. I'd recommend Daniel's place to anyone looking for a stylish and superb location Brooklyn visit![QWERTY123]We had a nice stay with Daniel and it was very smooth. 
Location was great and very convenient.[QWERTY123]A gem in the heart of Williamsburg[QWERTY123]We had a wonderful stay. Daniel's apartment is very cool and comfortable and the location is perfect. Super easy check-in. We'd definitely stay there again.[QWERTY123]Comfortable, stylish, and well-located loft space. As a bonus, it's really tastefully decorated. The communication was prompt and direct- would definitely recommend.[QWERTY123]Highly recommend for anyone looking for a great location and housing in Brooklyn[QWERTY123]nice, big place with a lot of decorative features. location was good, on the quiet side of williamsburg right next to the water, close enough to walk to great restaurants bars and shops. about a 10 minute walk to marcy train station. big dining table with seats. lots of plants and books in the apartment as well[QWERTY123]An incredible space! Beautiful apartment with ample lighting, tasteful decor and furniture. Was the perfect location for the interview we filmed in the bright kitchen. Daniel was so amenable to us and our schedule and was a quick communicator - we were able to book the space in an hour after requesting. It was also very easy to get into the apartment.
For a shoot, this is a gorgeous space with ample room and beautiful light. For a stay, you can't find a better location in Brooklyn for this price! Highly recommend. Thank you Daniel![QWERTY123]Amazing communication with Daniel! I booked on behalf of my partner who said it was an absolutely fantastic place in the best location for them. A brilliant place for a weekend getaway! Highly recommend.[QWERTY123]We loved our stay in this little nook in Williamsburg. Beautifully decorated by someone with a very artistic eye. We wanted an “authentic” Brooklyn experience and this place delivered. The location is fabulous and we walked around the neighborhood a lot. The Kitchen is well equipped (we cook most of our own food) and there were a lot of comfortable furniture all over the place!

A couple notes: two flights of stairs so if you have a lot of luggage, start working on those bicep curls now. 

Also, the AC only cools a portion of the house and when it gets hot outside... well, it’s not always the most chill place. That said, it only got uncomfortable when it was 90+ degrees outside. 

Wonderful experience overall and Daniel was very friendly and nice![QWERTY123]Daniel was very fast in answering any question and  a great help. 
The location his apartment is amazing as Manhattan is easy reachable via the eat river ferry or via subway. Williamsburg is a very nice place with plenty of restaurants. The Domino Park is just around the corner, the sunsets are unbelievable.
The Apartment is very clean and everything you need you will find. I was there with my son age 17 and we had plenty of space what we liked. 
The interieor of the apparent is amazing and just a great style. 
I can highly recommend to book this place as everything is perfect, location as well as the Apartment.[QWERTY123]Perfect Brooklyn apartment. Beautiful apartment and a great use of space. Very clean, easy check in and out. Ample street parking. Awesome location.[QWERTY123]Daniel’s apartment is a show stopper! You walk in and you feel like you’re walking into a sanctuary. The decor and layout of the space is so unique and interesting - I honestly feel inspired to buy myself some wooden plant hangers. Not only was it beautiful, it was functional. The space has all the amenities you could need for making food, watching TV, working from the listing. The beds are firm, but comfy. The AC works well, but it’s always a battle against the NY summer heat. This is a great place for close friends, a family, or a couple. We would definitely come again! Thanks, Daniel![QWERTY123]Precioso apartamento en Williamsburg/Brooklyn, muy cerca de Domino Park y de restaurantes y cafeterías. Decorado con muchísimo gusto y estilo. La llegada fue perfecta y nos sentimos muy a gusto con el AC portátil no pasamos calor. El proyector para ver una película en la noche también es un plus. Fantástica experiencia![QWERTY123]This space is magical. Ideal Brooklyn pad- stylish, big kitchen, amazing location. You can walk to tons of bars, restaurants and shops easily. I would stay here again in a heartbeat.[QWERTY123]Attractive apartment near to lots of good places to eat, drink and watch live music. I had a long stay for work and did feel it was short of a few practical items that would have made the stay easier - TV, washing machine etc. 

Last but not least I stayed in mid summer and the portable aircon unit was not really up to the task, but I suspect I just got unlucky to be there in the hottest couple of weeks. 

It’s a good place to stay, in a great area and close to manhattan if you need it. Ideal for short trips.[QWERTY123]We had a wonderful stay at Daniels apartment. It is very very cozy and interesting do discover it’s little lovely details. 
Our stay was very comfortable as Daniel was very responsive and easy to communicate, enter, ... . 
We would compliantly recommend to stay at his appartement.[QWERTY123]Absolutely one of my favorite Airbnb so far! Very stylish and relaxing space. A rare thing in the middle of Brooklyn![QWERTY123]HIGHLY RECOMMEND staying at Daniel's place. The space is decorated so beautifully and it is so cozy and comfortable. The furniture is so awesome, he truly has an eye for interior styling. It is walking distance to Bedford ave. in Williamsburg and its also right on the water close to Domino Park. Daniel was quick to answer any question I had and he was super easy going. I absolutely plan on staying here again![QWERTY123]Daniel's home is one of the most charming homes I've ever stayed at. The photos are an exact representation of the space. You will not find surprises with what you are getting, but in person, there is clearly a lot of thoughtfulness and detail not captured by the general photos. The little things Daniel put into his home such as the hanging partitions make it seem more cozy and lived in. Definitely, the most enjoyable part of the space for myself was an easily operable projector screen for a cute movie night, looking back at photos from your recent trip, and casually lounging around. Daniel as a host was responsive, attentive, and his directions for his home are clear to follow.[QWERTY123]Cosy one-bedroom in the heart of Williamsburg. love the mid- century furniture and the great taste overall. Daniel was easy to communicate with and responsive. I would recommend.[QWERTY123]We very much enjoyed our stay  - good location (right by bridge) and 6 - 10 min from metro and restaurant core.  The inside of the place is amazing - just beautifully done and lots of thoughtful touches and very elegant and bright.  You have to  like the style and be careful (not good for young kids) but we enjoyed staying in the space.  The third bed is in the living room, so you know.  Would be best for a couple.  And,  stairs leading to the apartment are steep (and ugly - don't be surprised).  But, no problem overall.   Would stay there again.[QWERTY123]Daniel’s place is a truly crafty and artistic labor of love. It was a pleasure to discover all the custom made decoration and spaces. However, we were a bit cold as there is only one heater and the shower was a bit cumbersome to use"	40.70933027767142	-73.96791761266013	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/16595	3	375.0	0.8
15	5178	"MR. Kasai was a grreat host , very helpful and hospitable , this room is really great value considering comfort and location , the only drawback is the street noise ;[QWERTY123]The room is great and the hosts are superb!![QWERTY123]Very good experience. The room is clean, quiet (separated from the main living area) and centrally located in midtown Manhattan. I would recommend this room.[QWERTY123]i agree with other reviewers in that the location is superb and the host is nice (total privacy is guaranteed), but i would not recommend this room if you're sensitive to noises (i felt as if i was sleeping in the center of the 8th avenue) and smell of smoking like myself. Especially, i barely slept due to the noises (construction, buses, fights of drunken men and women all night) ... i think that it might be because of the way air conditioner is attached to the window.[QWERTY123]Absolutely excellent. Couldnt have found a better room. Quiet, centrally located, clean and with more than enough personal space. Shun is a gracious host, and any person who chooses to stay here will not regret it![QWERTY123]nice and clean, good location[QWERTY123]Can't say enough positive things about this place and about Shunichi (Shun) and Akiko, especially for the VERY REASONABLE price.   Shun is a gracious and unobtrusive host.  He even offered to connect his extra laptop for me to have web access to look up theater times, museum info, etc.  The microwave, refrigerator, and flat panel TV (with cable) are all great amenities.  The street noise is really no big deal considering the very, very convenient 2nd floor location.  The noise is typical for New York.  Bring ear plugs and a sleeping pill if you really want to be assured a good night's sleep.  (Shun and Akiko, here is my one important suggestion:  Go to IKEA or Bed, Bath & Beyond (or even JCPenney) and get a set of matching sheets, duvet / comforter cover and 2-4 matching pillows and pillowcases.  The sheets,  and especially the pillows,  were sub-standard even at your very competitive rate.  If you do this, you would definitely earn 5-stars from me!  Thanks again for a fantastic stay overall!  You guys were wonderful!![QWERTY123]What a wonderful experience.  WOW!  The host, the apartment, the location, the price.  I could not have asked for a nicer, cleaner, more hospitable place and host.  If and when I return to NYC, I do hope this is still available.  If not, how sad for me.  Thank you for making my trip such a positive and enjoyable experience.[QWERTY123]Had a nice quiet time at the apartment.  I got lots of privacy and the LOCATION was fabulous!  Can't beat it![QWERTY123]My three nights at the 55th Street room were perfect.  Shun met me as soon as I arrived on his doorstep. He showed me in and left me alone.  He seemed to understand from the moment I got there what I wanted and needed.  The room is clean and comfortable.  The down comforter and flat screen were more than I ever expected.  The tea and cocoa were perfect for the times I came in for a rest from my long walks on the sidewalks of my favorite city. The apartment is just three blocks from Columbus Circle,  and just a few blocks to the Theatre District.  There are good places to eat very near by. The bakery around the corner on Eighth Ave was very good and Luigi’s Pizza across the avenue was a favorite of my teenage son’s last time we were there as a family.  I was able to live like a New Yorker for those three days and it was exactly what I needed.  I will definitely stay with Shun and Akiko again when I come to NYC. I recommend this accommodation to anyone who wants to experience living in NYC, not just visiting.  I know this neighborhood well, having lived there in the 80’s, and I could not have asked for more. It was like being home, only a lot better, because I was unfettered and able to do exactly what I wanted.  I can’t wait to go back again. Thank you, Shun![QWERTY123]the room is very nice and warm. the hosts are realy nice and friendly. the location of the place is great, close to all the places we wanted to visit in n.y and to the subway. highly recomended[QWERTY123]My hosts were the best. Very clean, great location and made certain to meet me on arrival to insure I had what I needed and provided complete privacy, service and more than what I'd hoped to find. As a frequent business traveler for years it is now my preferred location and choice in NY. I will stay here again and highly recommend this to all of my contacts, friends and family.

[QWERTY123]The apartment is not the place shown in the pictures, it was not clean, never met Akiko only her friend (Website hidden by Airbnb) unfortunetly I have nothing positive to say about my stay.  Sorry, but I feel cheated!![QWERTY123]It was very pleasant stay in New York. Shun is a great host and I would come back anytime. The Appartement is a nice one and equipped with everything you need (microwave, fast internet, cable tv etc.) Thank you Shun, it was a nice week in New York![QWERTY123]I also had a great time in NYC and the apartment is well situated near the center (Times Square  / Central Park) and Columbus subway station.
Shun and Akika were pleasant and although I came in late every night they hadn't an issue and even allowed me a late checkout.
Apart from what Steffen F. mentioned you also have a working window Air Conditioner (AC) in the room - much needed for the upcoming summer.
One comment is that the bed is a standard ""Double"" Width - 55"" / 1.4meter which is nice and large for a Single.
Thanks Shun for a great ""In Manhattan"" option and allowing me in so late at night, I do hope to stay again ;).[QWERTY123]I also had a great time in NYC and the apartment gave me what I wanted and needed.  Thank you Shun.[QWERTY123]My friend and I had an amazing time in NYC thanks to the hospitality of Mr. Shun and Akiko. We were given more than ample privacy, the house rules were VERY reasonable. The room, bed, linens, and shared bathroom was clean. They were very kind and welcoming and we would recommend them to anyone who's looking for a great place, in a great location, at a very reasonable price.[QWERTY123]Great location in Manhattan, next to everything. Apartment a little bit old, and noisy, but it is Manhattan, so what do you expect? For the price I found it perfect!
Shun is very nice, he also helped us with our baggage, he purt water for us in the fridge (there is a little fridge and microwave in the bedroom)
We loved our stay in Shun apartment.[QWERTY123]Really excellent location. Only a few blocks from Columbus Circle metro station and the 51st St station. Tons of great restaurants near by and even closer to the attractions than I expected. The room is very spacious and didn't feel like I was living out of a hotel room and it had a tea pot, microwave, and fridge.Provides towels and toiletries. I only saw Shun twice in 6 days so it was very private. Shun was very nice and I will stay here again on my next trip to NY. High recommend![QWERTY123]Very kind and hospitable. Of course the location is great for everything.
the room was spacious and included internet, and cooking possibilities.
i would definitely return.[QWERTY123]Fantastic location, very private, I came and went as I pleased. Aircon was a blessing, and the internet fast as well. I would stay there again![QWERTY123]We stayed at Shun's place for a week in july. His flat is EXTREMELY well located (5minutes walking from Times square and central park). It's also very close to the metro (didn't have to make any transfer in the subway during the week). Shun is nice, very discreet. Privacy garanteed. 
The bad point of being so well located is that it's very noisy, even during the night. The room was ok but not perfectly clean (dirty dishes, earings in the sheets, dust, ...). 
We do still recommand this place because of the price, and also of the location.[QWERTY123]It is a perfect place to visit NY; all interesting places are near by, or you can use the subway. The room is ok, the bed is for one people very big :-)
The only thing I did`nt like; the bathroom was dirty.[QWERTY123]chambre tres bien située, du bruit mais c'est normal on est en plein Manhatan. Le propriétaire est tres discret je vous le recommande tres bonne adresse[QWERTY123]Host promptly and politely replied to all of our inquiries, and the room was simply furnished, but clean and comfortable.  The Midtown location is superb and we highly recommend this apartment.  Thanks Shun![QWERTY123]This is a private room in a shared apartment with the host. 
Is very well located, close to subway station in a very safety neighbourhood, lots of dinners, restaurants, drugstores nearby. 

The host wakes up early to work, and as I went out and return late in the evening, it was like having a not shared apartment. 

Very clean and confortable. Bathroom in excellent conditions.

Totally recommended.[QWERTY123]Oh my god ! Shun is an amazing host, very careful gives you all you need (towels, shampoo, internet adapter,...). The room is great and it has airco which is a real blessing in the deep heat summer of Manhattan! The location is amzing (a few blocks from Central Park, Time Square, MoMA and a lot of local amenties...) T
I would recommend it to any couple that wanna visit NYC ! I'll definatly go back there !![QWERTY123]I recently stayed at Shun's apartment (Sept 2010).
The apartment is perfectly located in the heart of Manhattan. It is a close walking distance to times square, and major subways that makes commuting around NY very easy.
I was in NY to take dance classes, and Shun's apartment was perfectly located within walkiing distance to Broadway Dance Centre (10-15mins), Steps on Broadway (20 mins) and Ailey Dance Centre (5-10 mins).  
Shun was very hospitable allowing me to use his lap top and internet.  The room was spacious and entirely adequate as I only came back late at night to sleep for a few hours. The facilities were clean and adequate.
Yes it can be a little noisy at nigh which made sleeping a little difficult, but the room, its location and the hosts were exactly what i needed for this trip.  
I would thoroughly recommend this apartment to any single or couple looking to stay somewhere convenient in NY.[QWERTY123]I was in NYC from the 23rd Sept to the 06th Oct 2010. I had a great trip to NYC. The building is an old construction, one block away the famous and new Hearst Tower. Market open 24h one block away and more than 3 subway line 5 mins walking. The appartment is quite simple but with everything. Shun was a nice host, keeping your privacy and always helping. The appartment is 15 mins walking from 6th ave, Rockeffeler, Grand Army, Times Sq, 5 mins of Columbus Circle and Central Park ... Great ... In the heart of Midtown. Hope to come again soon.[QWERTY123]Fantastic apartment, fantastic location and fantastic Shun. I´ll go back. Un excelente trato y muy respetuoso con nuestra privacidad. Gracias Shun[QWERTY123]It was my first experience in Airbnb and was perfect. 

Shun was very helpful and he was in his own world so the life in the apartment was like I had my own apartment.

The apartment was clean, close to everything and I didn´t miss anything. It´s a good option if you don´t want luxury and you want a good place for a good price.[QWERTY123]Shun was a gracious host, the room was as advertised and very clean was in a good part of manhattan which made our trip very enjoyable, would stay with shun again[QWERTY123]
Shun place is fantastic! Everything from clean towels, to toiletries was provided. 
Place is accessible to many prime location. No doubt it is noisy at times, but it is still a place which I would strongly recommend. 

- maybe it will be great to have a full length mirror in the room.

- would also be great to have a small stool at the shoes area. 

Still, Shun is a helpful host whom doesn't have much restriction and respects the privacy of his guest. 

Thumbs up and highly recommended. 

Thank you Shun. 



[QWERTY123]Shun is very nice and quiet.  I had a great week of staying at his place. Big individual room with all facilities.  I love to come back again in future. The only thing to improve is the cigrate smell from his room.  It's separated from the rental room but the smell can travel to the whole place.  Shun should buy a airfilter to put in his room.  It will be a better environment.[QWERTY123]Shun was a great host!! Spent a few days before thanksgiving.  Right in the middle of Midtown West.  Close to everything!! I didn't see Shun much, the room is very private.  Would rent from again next time in NYC![QWERTY123]Shun's appartment is in an excellent location. We had our privacy and the room was exactly as show on the photo. Very basic but clean. We probably only saw Shun 2 or 3 times during our stay. It was our first visit to New York and it would have been appreciated if Shun had at least on one occasion (perhaps upon arrival or the day after) offered some information about the area or check with us if we had any questions. We thought Shun was friendly but very reserved .Bottom line: great location, close to places of interest (we practically walked everywhere), clean but basic accommodation, however, don't expect a social, interactive host because once you've checked-in, you're on your own! Not an unpleasant experience overall.[QWERTY123]Great stay at Shun's apartment.  GREAT location, within walking distance of Times Square and a host of other attractions.  Spacious room, nicely warm despite frigid weather.  Lots of privacy, great internet connection.  Also lots of good inexpensive restaurants around.  I especially enjoyed a Cuban place around the corner with great Cuban jazz.[QWERTY123]This was our first time using airbnb and we couldn't be anymore thrilled we did. For the price and the location Shun's place was definitely worth it. We were within walking distance to everything, the subway was only 2 blocks north, along with columbus circle, central park and the time warner building. We only had to walk less than 8 mins to Radio City and rockefeller center. 
We had our own keys and could come and go as freely as we wanted. We had even came in really late a couple times. And we only saw Shun 2 times during the stay. 
We would definitely stay here again if we were to visit NY. Thanks![QWERTY123]Shun is very kind and excellent host. The place is big and walking distance from Central Park and Times Square, we really enjoyed our time in NYC and we'll definitely recommend Shun's apartment. Thank you very much for everything![QWERTY123]We would stay here again with Shun.  Perfect location for NYC, easy to get around on foot and subway (5min walk to closest subway).  24hr conveient store downstairs, bottle shop, pharmacy not far.  Shun was very quiet and kept to himself.  For what you pay, I couldn't ask for anything else.  Our plane was delayed because of the blizzard and didn't arrive till late at night.  He let us in and made us a coffee![QWERTY123]I personally think that this apartment is a total worth of it's money. Yes, you could get an apartment which is halve it's price, but Shun keeps his place perfectly clean and provides many unexpected ammenities! Being a 3 street walk away from the Colombus Circle Subway, it's surrounding area's are brightly lit even after midnight.[QWERTY123]Shun's place is ideal for a short break to New York - just a 10 minute walk or less to times square and maybe 5 minutes to central park. Safe neighbourhood to walk around in at night. Room is fine, TV with a few channels and a desk there. bathroom is also fine. didnt really see that much of Shun as we were out exploring most of the time!! thanks for a plesant stay! if i come to NY again I would defo go bak there!
he also seems to be very popular as others had just left as we got there and some more people were arriving as we left!![QWERTY123]Though I did not stay there I give Shun 5 stars! My flight was cancelled 2 days in a row due to a major snow storm and Shun was very nice about the whole thing. He could not have been more understanding with each call. I have him saved to my favorites for my next trip I will stay with him if its available. Thanks Shun![QWERTY123]This was an excellent place to stay! Its close to all NYC's attractions and doorstep away from the high end of Fifth Ave and Central Park. It is also very convenient to the subway.  Room as big and clean, with all the necessities you need. Highly recommended.[QWERTY123]Great location, flexible host, basic accommodation.[QWERTY123]Great location. Its a real short walk to several neighborhood resturants on 9th! Basic room, but was perfect![QWERTY123]Shun's place was a great place to move around in the city.  It's about 15 mins by train to 34th street or Times square station.  There is couple of restaurants around the corner and pharmacy for all your immediate needs.  Shun was very flexible accomodating me as I was later than expected due to travel complications.  He waited at the apartment to receive me.  He even grabbed my bags up to the second floor. The main entrance is a small hallway that leads to the two rooms. If you a tad bit alergic to dust , you should not stay here.  Otherwise, the room is very large, with a small working fridge, microwave and lots of channels for cable.  This kitchen is a bit odd to use since it is in the host's living area and you would be separated by a glass door.  If you are there for a short stay then eating out and buying things that can be reheated would work best.  Although, Shun said that if I needed a cup or plate from the kitchen I was free to use which was nice of him.  The hosts were very quiet all weekend I really didn't see them.  Although, if I needed something I'm sure I could have asked.  I would say location-wise and room needs this was a decent place.[QWERTY123]It was a perfect location. Near Central Park, Times Square, Subway station... Everything was perfect in the room and very well furnished. I highly recommend this place. This is an address I keep in my contacts for a future travel to NYC![QWERTY123]Stayed here from feb 25th to 27th. Was my first visit to NYC. The pictures reflect what you get. The location is amazing as you are close to Time Square, Central park, 5th avenue, metro,etc... So for what you pay it's a great place to stay... But it's not a hotel... The inside of the building is not the greatest and in an OK condition. 

The Host was really quite, friendly and very helpful. You have a tv with a good selection of channels, wired interenet, a table, a chair and a stool. The bed is comfy.

I enjoyed my stay there but I would probably stay in a hotel next time. If you are looking to save money then this is the place to be. If you an afford the extra 40 dollars/night then go for a hotel room.

[QWERTY123]Première fois à New York et très bon séjour ! L'appartement de Shun est vraiment bien situé, à proximité de tout et la chambre est plutôt grande et confonrtable. De plus le métro est à côté donc c'est également très pratique pour aller dans les lieux à visiter qui n'étaient pas proche. Times Square et Central park à côté ! Et enfin Shun est vraiment très gentil et discret. Il était là si nous avions des questions. Encore merci à lui pour ce très bon séjour, nous recommandons cet hébergement, si nous devons retourner à New York nous choisirons encore son appartement ![QWERTY123]Previous reviews said it all so I knew what to expect when I arrived. Shun was very accommodating from initial contact to meeting up, making the whole experience hassle free. Perfect location to get around to all the sights and around restaurants/eateries not in the high tourist area. Had a great meal/marguerita at Cancun, just around the corner. The room is as described, handy to have your own fridge/kettle in the room, and great to spread out on the table/chair/shelves/wardrobe so you're not living out of your bag the whole time. Would recommend to others looking for budget accommodation without sacrificing too much.[QWERTY123]The location is amazing and Shun is a very wonderful host.  The building itself is rather old, like most buildings are in NYC, but you can't beat the price for the location and wonderful host! Thanks Shun![QWERTY123]Hello everyone. I am from Russia. We was in Shun apartment in march with my daughter. It was wonderful. The room is clean and have everything what we need: plates, spoons, caps. The location is magnificent. We visit averything what we want.  Big thank's Shun.[QWERTY123]Great Location, with different subway lines just a couple of blocks walking north or east. Shun was a very quiet host, but that doesn't diminish the great location and accessible price of the place. He  helped me a lot lending me an Apple Express to have wireless wifi while staying there. Really safe neighborhood and got everything near (places to eat, buy food, drug store, shoe repair, Fedex, etc) just by walking. 

This is a perfect choice for people who want to save money and be in a quite central place. 

[QWERTY123]The location was amazing! The room was good, bed was nice, desk + internet, easy to get in and out of whenever I needed. I would recommend this room to any of my friends.[QWERTY123]shun is a great host and the place is great i walk for all manhattan, its close to times square, central park and so much more!![QWERTY123]Room is exactly as described. Very clean and location is very convenient![QWERTY123]great time. Shun welcomed me and helped with my bags. He told me all i needed to know and showed me how to use the wireless. Didnt see host much as i was in and out at all wierd times. had a great stay and would deffo return. great value fo money. Thanks Shun[QWERTY123]Our stay at this accomodation was very pleasent, as our host was. The location is absolutely great, although apartment needs some refurbishing. All in all, great experience![QWERTY123]perfect location ! we really enjoyed our stay, feeling home ! I strongly recommend it to anyone and will come back next time in NYC?[QWERTY123]We had a nice stay at shun. Location/price are fantastic, nearby columbis circle. Close to a lot of metro stations. The room is good, nothing special. We didn't see Shun very often, only when we arrived. We liked it that way so it was perfect for us. If you want to stay in a clean, central place, with privacy then this is the place to stay.[QWERTY123]I stayed here 5 days in June 2011.
I had a nice stay at Shun's place and i really enjoyed my stay in NYC.

The location is really great, near Columbus Circle with a lot of subway lines. It's a very convenient  and central place.
The apartment is close to Broadway, Times Square (in a walking distance) etc.  

The room is as described. There is an air conditioner in the room, which is very useful in summer.
The bathroom and the room are quite clean but the apartment and the inside of the building should be refurbished.
Also, as the apartment is very close to 8th Ave., they is some traffic noise. 

I only saw Shun once when I arrived. He was very quiet and respected my privacy. 

For the price, i really think it's a great deal.
Thanks Shun !
[QWERTY123]This rental made our trip to New York a breeze! Shun was extremely accommodating for our late arrival and the room offered privacy and comfort at a great price! We will definitely be booking with Shun in the future![QWERTY123]2 fantastic weeks passed in NYC at Shun.
The flat is exactly as described; 3 minutes walking to the closest subway station, in a safe and great zone. 
Wifi, microwave, tv and A/C always available inside the room and no problem sharing the bathroom.
Shun waited me when I arrived late night, helping me with the luggage. He has been a very reseved host. 
A perfect experience that I will enjoy again if i go back to NYC.
Thanks Shun[QWERTY123]central location, very spacious and comfortable. shun is very helpful, especially with working out the internet connection and our very heavy luggage. thanks so much shun![QWERTY123]The location of this appartment is very good to visit the city. Close to the subway and in walking distance of many points of interests.
Though, the room is not so clean and cosy as it looks like on the pictures. The host was friendly to let us in, but we didin't see him the rest of our stay (4 nights). If you want to be left alone during your stay, this is a good alternative.[QWERTY123]If you like to have privacy, that's definitely your place. You won't feeled interrogated, small-chatted o wathever. 

Really spacious und good located, next to Columbus Circle.[QWERTY123]Good value for money, excellent location for Broadway-lovers, kind host.[QWERTY123]Great place to stay prime location.  Host was great very helpful when I couldn't get the internet working so he lent me his.  I highly recommend this place.  It is literally minutes from Central Park and a few blocks from Times Square and 5 minute walk to 2 different Subways it is great the room is large plenty of space.[QWERTY123]Amazing apartment position, room ok, maybe too small for 2 people.[QWERTY123]The host canceled my reservation 6 days before arrival.[QWERTY123]eu recomendo a todos. ocorreu tudo bem, não tenho nada a reclamar.[QWERTY123]Great Location, with different subway lines just a couple of blocks walking north or east. Shun was a very quiet host, but that doesn't diminish the great location and accessible price of the place. Really safe neighborhood and got everything near (places to eat, buy food, drug store, shoe repair, Fedex, etc) just by walking. This is a perfect choice for people who want to save money and be in a quite central place.

[QWERTY123]Shun was a great host! Both my partner and I stayed at his place and we were both very pleased with his kindness and generosity. We were also glad to have privacy. There were a few evening we got to say hello and peak our head into his living room to greet his cat. Otherwise, we mostly communicated when we arrived and departed. 
The apartment was clean, especially our room! On top of the cleanliness, his place is in a great location. It could not have been better. There were little grocery stores, places to eat, wonderful galleries, and central park all located in a close vicinity to his place! 
We definitely recommend staying with Shun! 
[QWERTY123]Situacion estupenda, el anfitrion fue amable aunque solo lo vimos el dia de llegada y el de salida. Por otro lado tanto la limpieza, mobiliario e intalaciones de la casa tercermundistas totalmente. El baño y la habitacion estaba super sucio y durante los 12 dias de estancia ni tan siquiera se nos ofrecio un cambio de toallas o sabanas.
La valoracion entre precio y servicio es como para otro viaje plantearse no utilizar esta pagina[QWERTY123]This place was really central, just 5-1minute walk to time square which was great. The place was less clean then expected, but the room was reasonably spacious with it's own fridge, cutlery & table. Shun was quite a private guy, we didn't see him much. Overall reasonable for the price, thanks Shun.[QWERTY123]Shun is so kind, the room is big (he kindly put an extra mattress for a third person) and is really comfortable. The bathroom was always clean and available and he offers everything you can need. The location is the best, you are close to everything, just two blocks of the nearest subway and in the area are plenty of delis so you can eat cheap and on the go. Only one thing, try to visit NY without many lugage, because travelling on the subway, streets or taking luggage trough the stairs, is not so nice if you have big pieces. 
I definitely recommend Shun if you are lucky enough to find availability in his appartment.

[QWERTY123]I can't really complain.  It was great considering the price and area.  The area was very convenient and perfect for me.    Shun was rarely ever home, but very nice.  He let me store my luggage for about 4 hours after check out because I didn't want to lug it around.  I would stay here again for sure.[QWERTY123]Having booked the first time with airbnb we were happy that our host and room was as described earlier. Shun is a friendly guy who still was preparing our room when we arrived an hour  early as announced. The room was large enough for two, has fridge and sat TV. Shun provided WIfi and wired internet access. The clean room itself is located near a subway which makes going with metro very easy. We have been a lot around in manhattan and enjoyed our stay for sleep and a shower at Shun. Near to this room we suggest a visit at Carnegie Deli for breakfast. Thanx Shun for beeing our host.[QWERTY123]We we're about 2 hours late because of traffic and when we arrive Shun was very helpfull, he help with carring up our bags, he helped up with the closest subway. The room is spacious enough for 2 people, we enjoyed our stay alot!! We definaitly recommend this apartment to anyone that wants to stay at a good price, and be close to everything.[QWERTY123]Fantastic location! Shun was very accommodating with arrival times and showed us around the apartment when we arrived. Room is quite large, well heated, and has great amenities (fridge, microwave, kettle). Most of the time we did not even see the hosts, as they kept to themselves or were at work. Only problem we had was getting the shower to stay at a decent temperature as it tended to be too hot or cold. Otherwise was a great experience, would definitely recommend![QWERTY123]Great location, walking distance to Columbus Circle, Central Park and Times Square. Subway is just one block away. If you're a tourist and doing things til late night, you can easily go back to the room. 
There's also plenty of 24hr food in the neighborhood. 
The internet is fast & reliable.
The plumbing is old, so getting the water to stay at the temperature you want can be a bit tricky. But it's a minor issue.[QWERTY123]The bedroom is all that someone could ask to explore the best highlights of Times Square and surroundings and is very close to the subway, providing access to the whole metropolitan area. It is very simple, but has everything one need to a good staying. Shunichi is concerned in providing a good accomodation and was available when requested.[QWERTY123]My sister and I stayed in Shun's apt for 4 nights.  The room is indeed located in a prime location - super convenient for any tourist needs and close to Times Square.  Also located very close to a metro stop so getting around is very simple.  

The room itself was nice and plain.  It is also adequately warm.  There was a microwave, fridge, closet space, desk and even an extra heater.  The bed and pillows were a little hard -- but spacious.  The traffic outside can get a little loud.  Like previous reviews, the hot water in the shower is a bit tricky, but I didn't have too much trouble figuring out how to get it to work.

Shun is pretty private but is always ready to assist and help accomodate any needs/requests.  We were usually gone all day so there was minimal interaction with the host.  

The overal experience was very positive and if I ever need lodgings in Manhattan again, I would definitely see if Shun's place is up for grabs.  The only real criticism I have is that I didn't find the bed/pillows very comfortable (My sister said she liked firmer beds, so it's just a preference).[QWERTY123]Because I was in NYC in January specifically to see a number of shows (8!) and visit MOMA, the Guggenheim and the new World Trade Center memorial, staying at Shunichi's was perfect for me.  The room was warm and comfortable.  The small refrigerator and microwave were extremely helpful in keeping expenses down.  (Shun offers access to his kitchen off the main living room but I never used it, except to wash a few dishes.)  There is a TV, and the bed is large and cozy.  The bathroom is nice, and the shower is very good.  One irony is that, after an initial meeting with Shun during which he gave me a friendly orientation to the room and the apartment, I only caught brief glimpses of him for the next 9 days.  He was off to work by 8:00 a.m. and came home usually late so I had almost no contact with him!  For someone like me, seeking a warm abode while spending most days and many evenings out and about in Manhattan and Brooklyn, it was an extremely economical way to visit NYC and stay in a very central location (Website hidden by Airbnb)[QWERTY123]Clean room.  Flawless location.  Cordial host.  The right price.  The room is old and spare but well priced and quite comfortable.  I recommend it.[QWERTY123]This was by far my best experience with airbnb in New York by far. A great location, friendly accommodating, and a great room. I highly recommend it.

Adam[QWERTY123]Great place, great location.[QWERTY123]Shun's apartment is perfectly located at the heart of Manhattan, just a few block to the south of Lincoln center. The apartment itself is clean, convenient and provides plenty of privacy. Shun is a very kind host. Would love to stay there again.[QWERTY123]Large furnished is ideally located behind Broadway in Manhatten. If you want to live in the American fashion and eat out there are a myriad of cafes and sandwich bars. Close by are several  supermarkets where you can buy all you need to cook a meal at home. The facilities are adequate and include internet.[QWERTY123]Good place, great location, everything was as promised before.[QWERTY123]Shun is a great guy! Everything was perfect!![QWERTY123]I stayed 2 nights at Shun's place and I definitely recommend him to others. If you are a busy traveler, who will be most likely spending time outside (especially downtown Manhattan) and wants to have privacy and spend quite time for good rest at the end of the day at the place you stay, his place will be the perfect choice for you. The stuffs I listed under [What I did not like] should be considered as minor issues. My overall experience was very positive. 

[What I liked]
(1) Location was truly AMAZING. You cannot ask for more. Very close to Columbus Circle subway station and there were many little places to grab something to eat. There are 24 hours McDonald, Starbucks, 24 hours grocery store, Central Park, Shopping Mall and so on very close by. (2) Shun was a wonderful host. He is very flexible, kind, and communicative. He adjusted check-in, check-out time for me and even took care of my luggage on the day I was supposed to check out because I had to wait until 6PM to get in to the next accommodation arrangement. (3) Wireless Internet works very well, and TV in the room has many channels you can enjoy while you are in your room, (4) Fridge, microwave, some plates, and flatware in the room come extremely handy when you want to keep some drinks cold and have little snack without having to use the kitchen

[What I did not like]
(1) It was very tricky to use shower temperature control. The water becomes easily too cold or hot. (2) Lighting in the room was bit dark to me (3) No mirror in the room (4) Heating system was broken at the time I stayed, so I had to use Shun's small portable heater that was not strong enough[QWERTY123]Esta fue mi segunda estadia usando AirBnB, y al igual que la primera estubo tal cual esperaba. 

Shun fue muy buen afitrion, algo privado pero siempre dispuesto ayudar a hacer la estadia una placentera.
El cuarto es tal cual se describe. Limpio, comodo y te sientes como en tu casa.
Aunque queda frente a la calle, el ruido de los autos y algunas veces las sirenas no fue ningun problema para descansar.
La cama la encontre comoda igual que las almohadas y frisas.

Algunos lugares a la vuelta de la esquina para que consideren comer:
1. Matts Burger
2. Bread Co
3. El restaurant Thailandes de la esquina (al lado de Matts Burger)

De nuevo, tres cosas para considerar este APT.
1.Localizacion
2.Precio
3.Comodidad (TV, Horno Microondas, Agua Caliente, escritorio, Internet, Closet para la ropa)

Espero que su estadia en NY se placentera como lo fue la mia.
Gracias y saludos a todos los AirBnBfilios...[QWERTY123]I really enjoyed my time in NY at Shun's place. It is very close to the 5th Avenue and the Central Park. Also, there are several subway stations all around that takes you everywhere in Manhatan. The room was spacious and tidy. Even in winter, it was very warm. My first experience using Airbnb could not be better. Thank you, Shun.[QWERTY123]My stay at Shun's place was pleasant and easy. He made me feel at home and provided a small frig, a microwave, and internet access (as well as a computer).[QWERTY123]wir waren 11 tage zu gast, die lage war super, wir hatten die wohnung so gut wie immer für uns, mit anreise etc. hat alles gut geklappt. Fand aber das bett nicht sehr gemütlich, wir haben lieber außerhalb gegessen als zuhause. Die Gerüche in der Wohnung waren mir sehr fremd...[QWERTY123]Great Location, convenient to every where on Manhattan.[QWERTY123]I've had a great experience with this apartment. The price is affordable, the location is excellent (just a couple of blocks away from Central Park and MoMA, bus terminals reachable by foot), and the host had made my stay very comfortable. I was given a full set of keys, and from that point could come and go as i pleased, no further contact with the landlord necessary.[QWERTY123]Awesome experience, wish we'd stayed longer.  Shunichi was very kind the one time we saw him, when we got there and he showed us around and gave us keys.  The room is large for NY standards, the location is amazing, there's a fridge, microwave, dishes, tea, and water kettle.  And towels.  The room isn't perfectly clean like a hotel, but it's like staying in a friend's house.  The building is old and a little worn, but the neighborhood is great and you can easily walk to central park, delis, subways, and tons of other food.[QWERTY123]Nous avons séjourné une semaine chez Shun. Grande chambre très propre et bien équipée (frigo, micro-onde, bureau, ordinateur et wifi, étagère, grand placard...).
Shun a été très attentif à ce que nous manquions de rien tout en étant très discret. Nous l'avons très peu vu car nous rentrions souvent tard. Nous recommandons cette chambre.[QWERTY123]Took my girlfriend to New York for her birthday since I wanted to propose to her and New York was the place went to for our 1st date.  I wanted somewhere that was in a decent area, not pricy and within a good distance of all the Manhattan attractions.  

A friend on (Hidden by Airbnb) told me about this site because the prices for hotels were ridiculous.  I came across this posting and it was great.  Right off of 8th Ave, less than 5 blocks to beautiful Central Park and not far from Times Square and Penn Station.  If walking doesn't bother you and you want to fit in like a New Yorker, you can definitely get around to all the attractions without having to pay for a taxi or taking the subways.  My girlfriend and I had a great time!  

The room is not luxurious, but if you want a secure place to rest your head at night and still be in the main area of Times Square, it is perfect. There is a fridge, microwave, TV and DVD player in the room, and also free wi-fi for those who need to access the internet.  I have no complaints other than it being a little hot in the room because the weather was nice when we were there.  Other than not having a fan in the room, everything else was great.[QWERTY123]Had a wonderful time in NYC and thanks to Shun the room was safe, comfortable and close to all the best things to do in NY[QWERTY123]I had a wonderful time in NYC and thanks to Shun the room itself was safe, comfortable and very close to Central Park. I hope that Shun has next year a room for me.[QWERTY123]The location is great, Shun was nice and accommodating. Had no major issues or complaints.[QWERTY123]I arrived right around the time that I arranged with Shun to be there. Shun came down to the door and let me in. Perhaps he did this in order to lead me directly to the apartment the first time, as I might conceivably have gotten confused as to where the apartment is, due to the stairway and apartment layout. Anyway, first appearances of the building might be scary for some. It is rather run down. Indeed, the apartment must not have enough storage space because there are boxes lining the hallway leading to the main part of the apartment. The room is very basic, but is as advertised. There is a small refrigerator, some dishes and a microwave, a TV and WiFi. The apartment could use a cosmetic facelift, for sure, but apart from that, it was comfortable enough, though spartan. After introductions, I didn't see Shun again until shortly before I left. All in all, though I wouldn't necessarily recommend this for everyone, I would definitely return due to the convenience of location. Shun is pleasant, very quiet and reliable.[QWERTY123]Great host. I and my wife love each moment. Shun is a great host and your house has great localization.[QWERTY123]The big plus regarding Shun's apartment is the amazing location in the near of the central park, the MoMa and Times Square.  If you are a good walker, you can do a lot of things even without taking a taxi or the subway. Otherwise, a lot of subway stations are nearby. The apartment is none too cozy, but it is big and very private and you have everything in it you need (Wifi, dishes, fridge etc) and by the way, you will hardly find an accommodation in this area which offers you all this and still is affordable.  We really had a great time in New York![QWERTY123]Great value for money, Shun's place is so central and you just can't match it for the price. We were right at home for our week stay and there was plenty of room for us to spread out in our room. We loved having the fridge in the room and some dishes etc. it made our stay so easy.[QWERTY123]Location! Location! Location! Walking distance to everything. We enjoyed our stay in Shun's place. Near to subway, Central Park, Broadway, Time square. Walking distance to bus stations.[QWERTY123]Price is very good for this place. It's just as advertised. I only met Shun for 5 minutes when I left but overall a good room and he seemed like a nice guy. One complaint though is the construction noise next to the apartment is very loud. But this could be a temporary problem.
[QWERTY123]Everything was just great. Nice to feel like we lived in NYC for a couple of days. Shun was a great host. We only saw him upon arrival. He showed us around our room, gave us the guidelines for our stay, and handed us the keys. We never really saw him again, which was great. He had his own space, we had ours, and shared it easily. I would highly recommend his place.[QWERTY123]Shun was lovely, we only really saw him when we checked in but he showed us around the room and was very helpful. The place is in a fantastic location walking distance to Central Park and the public transport was very easy to manage from here! Would recommend it!!![QWERTY123]Everything about our stay was just great - the location, the air-conditioned room, the kind host. Since nobody was checking out, the host let us check in early after a red-eye flight. We were so grateful for it! 

Die Wohnung liegt in einer absolut großartigen Lage. Der Gastgeber ist höflich und hilfsbereit ohne sich auf zu drängen. Privatsphäre ist garantiert. 
Besonders freuten wir uns auch über die flexiblen Check-in und check-out Zeiten (wir hatten Glück und niemand checkte aus oder ein, als wir ankamen und abreisten). 
Absolut zu empfehlen![QWERTY123]Shun was a wonderful host. The room was very clean, quiet, and the amenities were excellent. I rarely saw Shun, though he was very polite and helpful. I would definitely stay here again.[QWERTY123]As Shun has advertised, it's a very basic, no-frills room. Good value for the location! Shun was polite and we had no issues with him as far as timing/picking up keys/communication was concerned.[QWERTY123]Goods apartaments, helpful owner. Convenient place in Manhatan.[QWERTY123]This location is amazing, especially for the price![QWERTY123]We've already stayed five times with airbnb and this was definitely the worst!
The bedroom smells, the bed and the pillows are horribly uncomfortable, it's loud.
The bathroom is a bit dirty, it smells of mildew and on the shower curtain there is a lot of mildew!!
The host let you feel unwanted,he doesn't want you to use the kitchen and isn't helpful at all.
The location isn't bad for that money, but if you can afford more don't stay here.[QWERTY123]Awesome location at a very good price! 
The room is as described with all that is required for a stay in NYC. 
Shunichi was a warm host and we barely saw him during our stay.[QWERTY123]We had a great time in New York City and our stay at Large Furnished certainly contributed to that! We received keys off the building, appartment and room and could use the bathroom and even the kitchen when Shun was not in. For two persons the place was big enough and the location at the intersection off 55th street and 8th avenue was on a walking distance of times square and the subway station at 50th street... Very nice![QWERTY123]This is the best deal in NYC!!!   The location is perfect and the room adequate and comfortable.  There is a microwave, fridge, and kettle with a variety of teas and coffee in the room so it is very self contained.  If you need additional kitchen facilities they are available when Shun is at work.  He is very quiet and I only saw him on arrival.  Shun was clear in the directions and everything worked out perfectly.  He was extremely helpful and set up a lap top computer for my use.  That was very kind and I greatly appreciated it. THANK YOU.[QWERTY123]Everything was like discript. The room is very central and good to recieve by public transport. Shun answerd always very fast and was very friendly. Would go there everytime again.[QWERTY123]LOCATION LOCATION AT AN AFFORDABLE PRICE!

If you want a place to stay in the heart of midtown and where your privacy is well-respected, then this is the place to be!

Shun is a prompt communicator. He greeted me at the door and carried my heavy bag to my room. I didn't see him in the week I was there -  great to feel I had my own space and no curfew. 

However, any advice I needed, Shun was always willing to help.

The room itself is spacious, has a microwave, a mini fridge, eating utensils, a tv and loads of pamphlets and general info on NYC. The mattress is a little hard and unless you don't mind snuggling in with another person with close contact, then it's ideal for one person only. Sure the street is loud (being on W55th and 8th) and the window's are not double-glazed so I'd recommend buying earplugs if noise is an issue.

The only discomfort at times was the hot water taking a long time to heat up for showers - again, it's expected for an older building with old plumbing. The bathroom is shared and relatively clean.

You're given your own key to come and go when please. Everything is right at your front door from restaurants to pharmacies. Times Square not far nor is Central Park (a must see) and the subway. 

Just a head's up there's no washing machine. You'll find the laundromat on 9th ave, a block away. 

I highly recommend Shun!! Many thanks :-)

[QWERTY123]Shun's unit is a simply-furnished room with a bed, bedding, functional shelving and seating, a microwave and small refrigerator.  A large window looks out to W 55th Street from the second floor.  The picture in the listing represents it well.

Stairs lead to the second-floor unit; Shun helped with my luggage, and was kind and communicative.  (There is no elevator.)  First entry is by door buzzer; after that one has keys.  There is street noise at all times of day and night; one gets accustomed to this and to audible chaos in New York.  There is some noise abatement from closing the window and curtain.
In October, it was chilly:  a nice touch is the ceramic heater.  Cooling is accomplished by raising the window slightly.  The (shared) bathroom is just outside the unit door, and also has a permanent-on heater.  The hosts ask guests to avoid using the bathroom 7-8mam weekdays, but this can be negotiated.  

I saw the hosts only briefly on arrival.  The unit is ideally located:  near the theatre district, and four blocks south of Columbus Circle, near Lincoln Center.  There's a lovely 24-hour cale/deli around the corner on 8th avenue (Bread Box), and a sizable (and busy) Starbucks on 57th two blocks north.

I slept reasonably, given the noise outside.  If this, or bedding (hard/soft) or other details are important, these are things to discuss with any host.  I'm just learning about the features important to me.

I recommend Shun's unit to anyone who needs simple lodging in the theatre district.[QWERTY123]Amazing location. Just a short walk from everything on Broadway.[QWERTY123]This is a no frills apartment in a great location. That said, the room is furnished with a fridge, microwave and a TV. The price is great for the location too. Shun is quiet and nice. He is there to greet you when you first arrive and help you settle down and set up the internet.[QWERTY123]It was lovely and in a perfect location![QWERTY123]Shun was very accommodating. The room is wonderful and very quiet. The neighborhood is great. I heartily recommend Mooncake Foods-- it's an Asian comfort food diner/cafe on 54th at 9th. Great, inexpensive food and draft Sapporo for $2.50/pint.[QWERTY123]La chambre était confortable bien que dépouillé de toutes décorations, surtout l'emplacement est idéal, proche des stations de métro et de broadway. 
Shun est un hote discret mais disponible[QWERTY123]Good apartment, clean and very private.
Seems like your own room, because the host is gone all day to work.
Shower was hard to adjust, it was very hot or very cold. And the electric central heating was broke. There was a portable heater in the room. Goog working, but still cold with 30F outside and bad isolating windows. Bed was very good and comfortable and warm. Liked my stay, I will recommend this![QWERTY123]It was a good trip. The flat is near Time Square. Theatres and the Central Park are nearby. Many places to eat. It was not much time to talk with Shunichi but I have good opinion about him. I'm going to stay there next time.[QWERTY123]The reservation was canceled 107 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.[QWERTY123]The room was as described. Very confortable and a lot of privacy. Shunichi was always helpfull and polite. The location is priceless, very close to subways, the central park and times square.
It was a bit difficult to adjust the water, it was too cold or too hot, but not a big deal. There was plenty of space in the room for two people. The fridge and microwave turned out to be really usefull. We will keep this in mind if going back to ny.[QWERTY123]Shun is nice person, very attentive and helped us with all your doubts. The place is really well situated and quite silent. Nice deal![QWERTY123]Shun's place is nice and conveniently located in Midtown. It's private and has a fridge, some dishes, microwave and tv. He helped me with my luggage and set me on my way with keys and wifi access. I did not have a problem with the shower as others have stated. I just kept adjusting the knobs until the water was comfortable. I would stay here again![QWERTY123]Shun est un hôte à la fois discret et serviable; nous avons eu des problèmes avec nos bagages et il nous a bien aidé.
La chambre est conforme à la photo; elle est assez grande pour 2 et tout est très fonctionnel et très pratique .
La douche est effectivement difficile à régler, mais en tout cas elle est bien chaude! et la salle de bain est suffisamment grande.
L'appartement est surtout très bien situé.
Il faudrait peut être un peu  de rénovation!
[QWERTY123]For the price, Shun's place in midtown is a great deal.
Shun was super friendly when I arrived, and i knew he would be helpful the rest of the week, but I did not call on him again and did not see him again either. The location is very close to columbus circle and other convenient subway stops, central park, etc, so it was really easy to get around. the room is spare, but warm and has plenty of shelving etc. he provided cups and bowls, a microwave and mini fridge, so i felt i could be somewhat selfsufficient - i did use his kitchen once. The sheets and room were clean, and the bathroom was very clean as well. i didn't turn on the tv, but it was there staring at me. i would have liked to have more hangers in the closet and access to an iron if possible, but it wasn't a big deal.
Shun's airbnb room needs art. airbnb community - lets give shun some art! other than staring at the spare walls, i had a great stay.
[QWERTY123]Apartment as described, clean and very private. The location is perfect. Shunichi was not intrusive and was very flexible with check-in/out times. Bed was very comfortable and warm.We would recommend it for its unbeatable value! Thanks[QWERTY123]Fabulous room in a perfect location at a great price, wld recommend this place to everyone and Shun was a great host![QWERTY123]Great host. The location is just great, but noisy. But you`ll be fine with some ear plugs.[QWERTY123]Appartement très très bien placé, proche du métro, de deux supermarchés, de Central Park.
Chambre spacieuse et Shun a pensé à tout! Un excellent choix.[QWERTY123]We had an excellent six night stay with Shunichi - at least we think it was him, as we only met twice during our six day stay.  Shun was however very friendly and we communicated when needed by sms - always very promptly. Check-in was a breeze. The neighborhood was excellent, safe with heaps of eating places within a five minute walk radius. Based from Shun's room we walked lots of NYC. The room is secure and basic but comfortable for all who spend their time out on the streets and in New York that's where you wanna be eh? Thanks Shun, we'll be back sometime![QWERTY123]Great location, you're close to everything you want to see as a tourist.
Very close to central park, broadway, MOMA ...
The room is just as pictured even though the painting is not as fresh.[QWERTY123]Shun is a quiet and friendly host who gives his guests their own independence which allowed me to have an authentic NYC experience without any hassle whatsoever.

The room is large and well equipped and sufficient for the price. The location is great for midtown.

Highly recommended.[QWERTY123]Shun was a great host - he was very prompt when replying to enquiries and he made sure the check-in process went smoothly. The location of the apartment was amazing - walking distance from both Times Square and Central Park. We had a great time here![QWERTY123]First of all we have to say that the hosts (Shun & Akiko) are really friendly, quiet and helpful. For staying connected Shun borrowed us his Blackberry because the airline lost our complete baggage. Thanks for that!
Unfortunately we have nothing good to say about our room. It's true that the room needs a fresh painting as stated before. The pictures in this ad must be taken years ago or are simply photoshopped because the walls are more black of dirt as white as they seem on the pictures. The whole room was unbelievable dirty and seemed not beeing cleaned properly for ages. Hairs everywhere, crumbs on the floor and a lot of dust. Honestly it was a small shock when we entered the room for the first time. Before our trip to New York we read all of the ratings here and decided us for Shun, because nearly everyone stated how clean the apartement is. We are definitely not stuffy, but this is simply not true.  The same for the bathroom. Dozens of hairs everywhere (floor,  washbasin, shower) and a lot of mold on the shower curtain, the window and the  bath tub. Honestly it was a kind of disgusting.
This was our first trip with airbnb and it was probably our last too. We have no explanation how 140+ ratings can differ from our impression so much. Nevertheless we had a great time in NYC and had to arrange with the whole situation at ""home"".

June 2013[QWERTY123]This was my second stay with Shun.  He's an excellent and prompt communicator.  The lodging is exactly as described, furnished with a terrific A/C, mini-refrigerator and microwave. Queen bed is comfy. Situation is perfect for a theater-goer, by walking or easy cab ride. I'm slightly mobility-disabled and Shun's unit is just one flight up. He helped me with luggage on arrival. Perfect wireless. Several reasonable eating options very close:  Bread Box on 8th and Hale/Hearty (soup,salad,sandwich) across street. Thank you, Shun![QWERTY123]Location, location, location!  Shunichi's place has the perfect location in New York - you walk out the door to restaurants, laundreys, whatever you want - and can then walk to Central Park or the Broadway theater district with ease.  At first I thought his building was a little run-down, but the room itself had everything I needed - a small fridge, air-conditioning (it was hot!), a microwave, dishes, cutlery, a desk, storage space, and a comfortable bed.  The shower would be better with more water pressure, but this was a minor matter.  Shun himself was there waiting for me and helped with the luggage.  He's a fairly quiet, retiring sort and I didn't see him much during my stay - which made me feel like it was my own place.  A great stay - thanks, Shun![QWERTY123]Shunichi is a great host, very discreet, yet helpful.

the location is just perfect (hence very noisy because located in a very busy neighborhood, don't forget your earplugs!).

Contrary to some comments, I didn't find the appartment dirty, just timeworn, price-quality ratio is quite good.[QWERTY123]Très bon séjour à New York dans cette chambre très bien située au centre de Manhattan (moins de 5 min de marche de Central park, 5th Avenue, la station de métro et de nombreux magasins et restaurants).
Chambre bien équipée et très propre malgré une petite odeur dérangeante mais supportable. Quartier très sûr.
Shunishi est très gentil.
Je recommande cette chambre pour vos futurs séjours à Manhattan.[QWERTY123]The location is great! Very near to the most famous attractions of the city, like Times Square, Broadway and the amazing Central Park, to the subway and to lots of restaurants and markets.
We didn't find the room and the bathroom dirty. People who decide to travel with Airbnb should consider that they will stay in a private home and not in a luxury hotel!!! 
The microwave and the fridge in our bedroom have been very useful, such as the towels and the dishes. 
And last but not least, Shun is a very polite, quiet and discreet man.
We think it's almost impossibile to find another place in NYC so well-situated and comfortable at the same price!!! 
Thank you!!![QWERTY123]I think the location is great! 
I could walk easily to some of famous attractions and the neighborhood is very convenient.
I only met the host twice when check-in & out. I feel like it was my own apartment. Nothing to complain from my experience. 
[QWERTY123]ligging: ideaal
gastvrijheid: vriendelijk maar nogal afzijdig
kamer en badkamer: sober, rommelig en niet zo proper[QWERTY123]I had a great stay at Shunichi's apartment. He had helped me carry my luggage up the stairs when I checked in, showed me around the apartment, and that was pretty much the only time I met with him. The room and bathroom were clean, and the location was good. I would definitely stay at his place again.[QWERTY123]For starters, great location. I was in NYC for only 3 days and 2 nights which meant i had to do a lot of running around and the location certainly helped. The apartment is located a couple of blocks south of central park and the subway station and a few blocks north of times square which made for great travelling times to all parts of the city. The apartment itself was nothing special. All the amenities were as described in the website except for an air conditioner, which i obviously did not need as i was visiting in winter. The room looked a bit worn down and probably needed a paint job. Some people here commented that the toilet was dirty but that was not the case. The apartment and toilet was a bit worn down but by no means dirty. Keep in mind that you are renting an apartment and not a luxury hotel. It is certainly good value for money and a great place to stay for a couple of days. Last but not the least, the host was very polite and friendly and i didn't get to see him much except while checking in and checking out. So, my honest assessment and recommendation is this- If you are looking for luxury and great comfort, then go to a luxury hotel. But if you want value for money, great location and a new yorker feeling stay at shunichi's, you'll not regret it!![QWERTY123]Great location, perfect sized room, friendly host & environment in general. The location near corner of 55th St & 8th ave is perfect. Short walk to subway, central park, times sq, plenty of places to eat, etc etc etc. Just perfect really. Anyone who hasn't been to Manhattan the place is easy to get around to all tourist attractions via the subway. $31 for a 7-day MetroCard with unlimited train & bus use.  Shunichi met me at check in & showed my the unit & all important things. We didn't see each other much at all for my whole 8-day stay. I will book with Shunichi again / every visit to NYC. Thanks again Shunichi.[QWERTY123]This is my second time staying with Shunichi, and he  is a gracious host. The apartment is incredibly well-located-- a short walk to Columbus Circle and surrounded by restaurants and shops. The room is comfortable with a refrigerator and microwave in the room. Everything is very clean and comfortable.[QWERTY123]L'appartamento è situato in una posizione davvero comoda: tra time square e central park, al primo piano di una tranquilla palazzina , abbiamo trovato un appartamentino davvero confortevole, la nostra stanza era servita da ogni confort.
Abbiamo trovato lenzuola pulite , set da bagno , frigo e forno a microonde.
Il proprietario di casa è stato davvero carino , dandoci riservatezza e libertà in tutto il nostro soggiorno .
[QWERTY123]A very well-situated apartment several blocks away from Central Park[QWERTY123]The photo gives a better image of the room than what it is. The room is small and can be cramped.  It is a good incentive to be out sightseeing all day and only using it for sleeping in. The bed was uncomfortable though.  But you cannot beat the location! The room is located four doors from the Soup Man and a 10 min walk to Times Square and 5 min walk to Central Park. Meals are best had outside the room at any of the many nearby diners and restaurants. Great breakfast at Cosmic Diner.  The shared bathroom was not a problem and the water was hot. Consider this if you want location and are prepared to put up with basics.[QWERTY123]If u are fine with older spaces with character, this space will be fine for you.  I loved that I had a completely separate room with my own keys and the bathroom was in the hall between my rom and his living room ets areas so I felt very comfortable. I was not there more than 6 hours each day and never saw him after he let me in.  It was worth the cost savings.  Just be aware this IS NOT A HOTEL   Bring a towel.  I had to buy one.  It was very close to everything.  Just a couple short blocks and 2 blocks from subway.  I would stay again.[QWERTY123]Super convenient location for exploring Midtown, the room had everything I needed and Shun was lovely on the brief occasion I met him. Exactly what I expected based on the description/reviews and would definitely stay again. Thanks Shun![QWERTY123]We were very happy with the room and had a great time in NYC.[QWERTY123]La habitación es cómoda y la ubicación es fantástica. Aunque casi no tuve contacto con Shunichi, fue muy amable para todo.

The room is comfortable, location was great. Even I have a few words with Shunichi, he was very helpfull and nice.[QWERTY123]We enjoyed our stay at Shun's apartment. As other reviewers have mentioned, the location is perfect for visitors as it is in walking distance of many attractions, especially MoMA, Rockerfeller Centre, Times Square, Central Park, etc. There are great eateries within a couple of minutes and the subway is a couple of blocks away. Shun was very welcoming, honest and reliable, the room was warm (this was winter time) and the bed was comfy. The place could do with a lick of paint and some artwork, but for the price we'd highly recommend Shun's apartment. Thanks Shun, and best wishes![QWERTY123]shunichi's place is perfectly located, a 5min walk to eather central park or times square! we did almost all of manhattan by walking. also the metro station is only a couple of minutes away. the apartment is clean and friendly, the bed is really nice to sleep in :) . all in all we can only recommend shunichi as a host, you couldn't find a better place to stay. 
perfect location and very nice apartment, we were 100% satisfied.[QWERTY123]Cool location few minutes by walk to time square and central park.
Small room but all what is necessary to survive in NY. Shared bathroom with enough space and without any time conflict with Shunichi unless you wake up at 6 am. Quiet place in an old building. Shunichi is nice and very respectuous of his guests.[QWERTY123]NA[QWERTY123]I really enjoyed my stay! The room was spacey, clean and well-furnished, and the location is really great. I actually didn't get a chance to meet Shun, but his friend let me into the apartment with no problem. Highly recommended![QWERTY123]Location, location, location!

Just 2 or 3 blocks to everything! basic, one channel tv, comfortable bed, fridge and microwave

All you need if you are looking for a place to sleep and take a bath. Clean. Near everything[QWERTY123]The place is perfect - clean, nice, very good location. And the Host was very nice. I recommend you this room in 100%[QWERTY123]Although we didn't get to see Shunichi very often, it was a pleasant stay. The apartment is clean, the bathroom as well. Our room, too. The TV-set is useless, there are no tv channels. The only thing: the plastic knives and forks have been very dirty (have already been used?) and it has been very cold in the room. But if you go there in late spring/summer, you might not have any problems at all. However this is the perfect place to stay for a small budget and is very close to Central Park and Times Square. We would definitely love to come back.[QWERTY123]Alors par quoi commencer? Je tiens à dire merci pour les punaises de lit que nous avons ramené ! Et croyez moi elle sont assez grosses (photos à l appui) pour vivre là depuis bien longtemps. Je ne vous détaille pas les complications et les désagréments causés. 
Ce qu'il faut savoir, c'est que l'hôte est juste venu avec une petite bombe insecticide-ridicule- et qu'il n'a pas répondu quand je lui ai demande quand il allait traiter la chambre! Pire il savait pertinemment qu'il y en avait car il nous a montré l'inutile protége matelas...
Bref je n'ai pas de conseil à donner, mais c'est important à savoir!
Le ménage est correct mais il y a de la poussière sur meuble salle de bain collée par la condensation. Les photos ont été prises il y a très longtemps car même la hotte de la cuisine a une couche de gras et moisi. 
La chambre est correcte mais ménage pas fait à fond. Chambre grande, dommage qu'elle soit spartiate car c'est un beau volume. Mais ça suffit pour un séjour à New York.

Sinon les points positifs qu'il faut reconnaître, un hôte très accommodant, flexible et qui nous garde les bagages jusqu'au départ. Situation idéale et quartier très sûr.


Faites votre choix![QWERTY123]Bonjour, 
nous avons séjourné 8 jours chez Sunichi Kasai dans la chambre meublée. A notre arrivée, nous avons croisé un couple qui venait de séjourner 2 nuits et qui nous a prévenu que la chambre (et l'appartement) n'étaient pas très propres. et nous pouvons le confirmer: la peinture de la chambre est écaillée et pas nette  le micro-onde et le frigo n'avaient pas été nettoyés, il y avait une tache sur la plaque tournante du micro-onde, nous ne l'avons donc pas utilisé..., la salle de bains n'était pas nette non plus et les joints de la baignoire étaient moisis, le plafond et les murs abimés. les 2 photos sur votre site ne correspondent donc plus à l'état actuel de la chambre, je pense que le ménage n'avait pas été fait à notre (Website hidden by Airbnb) a été fait très rapidement et pas à fond le 1er jour . il y a donc une détérioration depuis quelques mois voire deux années..
les points positifs sont la situation idéale près de central park et de broadway, et la discrétion et le calme de l'hote qui rentrait tard du travail; nous pouvions utiliser la salle de bains autant que nous voulions.[QWERTY123]My first experience with Airbnb in this apartment in Manhattan turned out to be a nightmare. As the host had told us, he or she (we never got to know their gender) would not be at the apt when we arrived. Instead, we were given the keys and some info on the location of the room and the shared bathroom, by a friend of the host. Although the apt was not as shown in the pictures, but a little dirtier and with the walls really bad painted, we did not care. The building is very old and the rugs look disgusting, but we did not care either.... until we spent the first 2 nights and we realised we were not alone. The room was heavily infested with bed bugs.  Out of the 4 nights payed, we could not sleep for 2 whole nights, I had to get medications for rashes that developed from the bites and I had our clothes and baggage sterilized because these bugs travel with you once you get them.

Other issues with the apartment:

The headless photo mounted on the page for the apartment also prevented any easy identification of the person owning or managing it.

The photos advertising the apartment did not correspond to the apartment.

I would strongly advise you not to rent this apartment, specially if you suffer from any allergies or if you wish to sleep. 
The worst part of the story, the bugs feed on blood and we had killed one and the stain stayed in the wall. When we came back from one of our tours, the stain was not there any more, which may mean that the host cleaned it and, hence, that he or she knew that the room was full of bed bugs.

I spent a lot of money on medications and lotions to get the rashes out of my whole body (even my face). Be safe, don't go there. Pictures of the bites available upon request![QWERTY123]I highly recommend staying with Shun. It's a great centralized location.  Easy walking distance to subway, central Park,  time square and many more amazing attractions NYC has to offer. 
We unfortunately never met Shun but it was a nice stay.  We will definitely stay here again.[QWERTY123]This was my second time at Schunichi's and like the previous guests I got bitten
by bed bugs. Now my fear is to have brought them back with me in my apartment.
The location of the apartment is awesome but the room is not as nice as pictured.
[QWERTY123]Well located, and Shunichi was accommodating with check-in and check-out hours![QWERTY123]Stayed here 2 night! The place was old but clean. It was the perfect location within walking distance between time square and Central Park![QWERTY123]La experiencia fue super positiva. El departamente esta ubicado en un lugar increible, cerda de Times Square, de los metros, del Central Park. La ubicación es perfecta. La habitación es espaciosa, y comoda.

Simple, reasonably priced food is nearby, Starbucks and subway entries nearby.  Especially have appreciated entry help from Shun for moving suitcases up one flight of stairs.[QWERTY123]Quick, one night stay. Easy, convenient.[QWERTY123]空港からの電車が遅れ､到着が遅れたのにも関わらず､快く歓迎してくださいました｡お部屋はとっても清潔で､冷蔵庫から電子ﾚﾝｼﾞ､ｺｯﾌﾟなどすべて揃っていて長期的な滞在にも良さそうと感じました｡ﾁｪｯｸｱｳﾄの時間も柔軟で､おかげでﾆｭｰﾖｰｸを荷物を持って歩くことなく満喫できました｡

In the room there is a toaster and a refrigerator so you can have breakfast there. A kitchen is also available, however we did not use it. Check-in and Check-in was fast and easy. Only thing is that there was a strange smell in the room and in the condo.  Overall a reasonable price for midtown Manhattan.[QWERTY123]Der Standort ist sehr gut, nahe am Broadway, Times Square und Central Park. Das Zimmer ist praktisch eingerichtet und man ist unter sich, Shunichi sieht man nicht sehr oft.
Preis/Leistung sehr gut![QWERTY123]We stayed just one night, but everything was fine, Shunichi was very flexible with our late arrival. The place was very central,I would certainly recommend this place:)[QWERTY123]The reservation was canceled 4 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.[QWERTY123]Nous avons passée 8 nuits chez Shunichi. La chambre est simple mais ça suffit largement. Elle est également bien isolée du reste de l'appartement et le bruit sur la rue est minime. Le lit est très confortable et heureusement car New York est très fatiguant ! 
Enfin pour ce qui est du quartier, c'est parfait. Nous avons tout à côté (métro, Moma, central park, Times square...). Je recommande cette chambre pour découvrir New York.[QWERTY123]Great location, few minutes walk to time square. Quick, clean, and relatively inexpensive room. I recommend it.[QWERTY123]Room was as described and even better...small refridgerator, microwave, toaster and electric water kettle in room..PERFECT. There was even tea bags!! They understand needs of the budget conscious traveller!! Shunichi arranged for his friend to meet me as my arrival time was delayed, much appreciated. Would stay there again for sure. Great first airbnb experience for me.[QWERTY123]The location is great! Really! 2 blocks away from subway E line, so you can to this place from JFK airport quiet fast.  3 block from central park, really nice! The room is big enough, and there is a fridge in the room which was really important. I had no problems with communication. Yeah, the furniture is not new, but for this price is a great deal in NYC![QWERTY123]Foi uma experiência muito boa, o Kasai foi muito atencioso, nos deixou muito à-vontade em seu apartamento.
A localização não poderia ser melhor, perto dos principais pontos turísticos de Nova Iorque e das principais avenidas.
O cômodo é aconchegante e possui espaço suficiente para realizar as refeições, também possui frigobar, micro-ondas e televisor.
Recomendo sem sombra de duvida realizar sua hospedagem com o Kasai.[QWERTY123]Good place to stay in terms of accessibility to the famous spots in NYC, restaurants and malls.[QWERTY123]This place is horrible and not what is represented in the photos. Not to mention very dirty. I had a horrible experience![QWERTY123]El lugar esta bien, el anfitrion es muy agradable.Todo estuvo bien[QWERTY123]Great people. They were wonderfully welcoming and hospitable. All amenities were included to make my stay comfortable.[QWERTY123]Shunichi is a very considerate host. And the location is perfect. Thanks![QWERTY123]Shunichi is a very nice guy. There was no problem to arrive morning and leave afternoon. Condo is located in the middle of Midtown, near the subway. Great location for short trip to NYC.[QWERTY123]Great experience! The room was just as pictured, and had a tea kettle, silverware and dishware so it was self contained, didn't even have to go into the kitchen, although you could if you wanted to. The host's friend let me in and was very nice to help me with my heavy luggage. Shunichi was barely home, and when he was, he was super quiet.[QWERTY123]La ubicación es perfecta y shun muy amable.
El cuarto acogedor y con todo lo necesario.
silencioco y tranquilo.
[QWERTY123]Muy buena ubicacion y muy comodo el cuarto, a Shunichi lo vimos solo el dia que nos fuimos, el cuarto tiene todo y es muy comodo, sin lujos pero por la ubicacion y el precio es excelente.[QWERTY123]Shunichi is a quiet host who gives you enough privacy. The apartment is very central and convenient. The room is not quiet as nice as on the photo but it was ok at all. It comes with water cattle, towels, tea, fridge and micro wave.
[QWERTY123]No tuvimos casi contacto con el anfitrión pero estuvo todo según lo coordinado, entrega de llaves, etc.
La habitación es como se ve en las fotos.
La ubicación es excelente, al lado de Central Park, a pocas cuadras de Times Square, muchas líneas de subte cerca.[QWERTY123]なかなかのﾛｹｰｼｮﾝ｡とても便利![QWERTY123]L’appartement est bien placé, relativement simple, les étagères dans les couloirs contiennent un peu de stock d’un boui-boui local et il y reste une odeur de soupe cuisinée la veille.
Tout est un peu vieillot. 

L’organisation de l’arrivée et de la sortie s’est bien passée.

je recommande à ceux qui ont le budget de faire un effort pour trouver mieux, surtout si vous êtes en couple.
[QWERTY123]Shunichi was a pleasant, quite and respectful host. Apartment is located brilliantly: right next to Broadway theater district, 10 minutes away from Rockefeller center and 5 minutes to the nearest subway (either Columbus circle or 7th Avenue). Highly recommended for anyone willing to explore Manhattan on a budget. Again, many thanks for our great stay and happy New Year![QWERTY123]Parfait pour personnes a budget serrer et ayant l'experience des backpaker comme nous. La chambre est assez grande, aucun soucis avec le lit, le prorietaire fut très souple avec une réservation 9 mois a l'avance, il fut aussi tres souple pour le depart et nous a permis de laisser nos bagage sur place jusqu'a l'heure de notre départ.
Quartier calme a 2 min du metro et tres proche du centre.
[QWERTY123]Actually we never met Shunichi, but a friend of him welcomed us super friendly. The room was exactly as shown in the pictures, bright and cozy. There were fresh towels we could use, we had a fridge, a microwave, a kettle and even tea and noodles. The location couldn't be better, you can get around easily. Its a 5 minute walk to Central Park, Timessquare or Rockefeller Center. You can even walk to the Empire State Building if you want, it is about 25 minutes, but there is a subway station right across the street as well. We can totally recommend Shunichis place and would stay there again![QWERTY123]- The host was not available and sent a friend to meet us at our designated arrival time (thumbs up).
- The location is great as it's close to everything (thumbs up).
- The room is large as advertised (good).
- The heating in the room wasn't working so we had a small electric heater in its place. I felt it wasn't adequate given it was about -10C outside. It was cold and I had to bundle up just to sleep and also wear 2 layers of socks to walk around the room (thumbs down). It would have been nice to know this ahead of time so I had the option to consider other places.
- As there was just one bathroom, there was a note on the door about bathroom usage and when would be blackout periods - this also would have been nice to know in advance (thumbs down).
- I didn't really stay long enough to interact with the owner of the place but I did make an effort to at least say hello.
- Overall the place looks a bit run down and obviously needs work.
[QWERTY123]Lets start with the good part: the room is in a great area and there are many great places in walking distance. The woman who let us in and was very welcoming and friendly. We got tea, cocoa, a microwave, a fridge, mugs, a toaster and a water boiler to use.

BUT

the TV didnt work; it was way to cold, its hardly possible to sleep; the bed was not like at the picture, it was much worse; the host didnt answer me when i had a problem finding the appartment; the room was not that clean, neither was the bathroom[QWERTY123]Lovely room, next to everything. Clean safe, lock on bedroom door. WiFi worked well and place was warm and comfortable. Apartment itself cluttered, but room was more than satisfactory. Great stay would choose here again[QWERTY123]The apartment was what we saw from pictures, the location is great.We were at the apartment practically alone, since we did not see Shunichi in the days we were.Your friend welcomed us.Everything was as expected.[QWERTY123]Estuvimos 7 noches y estuvo todo bien. No es exactamente igual a como se ve en la foto, pero se le toma cariño. Es espacioso, tiene todo lo necesario y a pesar del frio de afuera siempre estuvo caliente dentro. La ubicación es excelente, muy cerca de todo. Definitivamente volvería a quedarme ahí.[QWERTY123]I had a good stay at Shunichi's. The location was perfect right in the theatre district.
His girlfriend let me into the apartment and basically just let me know which key was which. However the rules of the house were clearly printed on the inside of the door so I had no further questions. I only spoke to Shunichi once to let him know at what time I was checking out. For the rest, I didn't see or hear them.

The apartment is basic and somewhat run down. Although clean, tidy and reasonably equipped. It's a bit too prosaic for a romantic get-away :)
The central location makes up for this.

My only real problem was with the plastic cover over the mattress. There was a fitted sheet over this but still... not very pleasant. Although the bed itself was fine.



[QWERTY123]Great location great room, all you'd need. Shunichi very nice guy and very private. He was really helpful when my flight / arrival times changed, got me in earlier than planned and when he was at work. Would definitely return. Thank you Shun.[QWERTY123]部屋はとても広く､ご紹介通り家具は一通り揃っています｡Wifiも問題なくつながり､ｸﾛｰｾﾞｯﾄまでありました｡今回6泊しましたが､不便なく過ごさせていただきました｡3月上旬でまだ寒い時期でしたが､暖房器具もあり､暖かくすごせました｡
立地はすばらしく､ﾐｯﾄﾞﾀｳﾝの主な観光地には徒歩で行けますし､地下鉄の駅も近くです｡
ﾎｽﾄは日本人の方ですので､ﾒｰﾙも日本語OKでした｡英語に不安のある方には特におすすめです｡[QWERTY123]Good location and clean. The apartment is old but everything was fine. Shunichi was very nice and the experience in NY was great[QWERTY123]Perfect place if you want to stay in Midtown Manhattan. The apartment is a bit clattered and run down, but the room is cosy and has everything one might need. Shunichi was very accommodating with my travel arrangements which made my life much easier.[QWERTY123]Shunichi was very kind and friendly with me, even when my flight was delayed. He arranged the check-in with a friend. The room is exactly as you can see on the photographs or even bigger, really. The bed is big and comfortable. The house is very very close to Times Square and Central Park, so its perfect to go walking. In another case, the subway is 2 blocks away. I will come back to NY, definitely, and I will go to Shunichi's house.[QWERTY123]He is very quiet but gave no idea about the area 
The room was a bit small and the walls and windows are dirty as was the microwave. We could not use the kitchen sink as it was blocked . Good location 
Dave[QWERTY123]La habitacion es como la indicada en la foto, casi no nos cruzamos con el dueno, solo para recoger y retirar las llaves.[QWERTY123]This is a great part of town. Just what I needed. Thanks Shunichi for taking good care!
[QWERTY123]Grande chambre spacieuse et confortable, côté pratique avec frigo et micro onde, juste un peu ""vieiyo"" par rapport au photo. L'emplacement de l'appartement est idéal, quartier calme et sympa, beaucoup de restaurant à côté. 
Shunichi est très serviable, compréhensible et très gentille. Séjour très agréable et je reviendrai sans problème.[QWERTY123]Muy buena ubicación. Es un barrio seguro y a unas pocas cuadras del Time Saquare y del Central Park. La habitación está equipada con todo lo necesario: heladera, microondas y mesa con dos sillas.
Casi no tuvimos contacto con Shunichi ya que el o nosotros no nos encontrabamos en el departamento. Pero El siempre se mostró amable y predispuesto para cualquier consulta o requerimiento nuestro.
Recomiendo para hospedarse.[QWERTY123]Muy buena ubicación. Es un barrio tranquilo y se encuentra ubicado muy cerca del Central Park y Times square. La habitación no es como muestra las imagenes, pero bien para pasar la noche. 
Casi no tuvimos contacto con Shunichi ya que el o nosotros no nos encontrabamos en el departamento. Fue muy amable al recibirnos, claro con las reglas de la casa, entrega de llaves y no habia problemas con la hora de llegada en la noche. 
Recomiendo para hospedarse[QWERTY123]Perfect location. Room was large enough, looks exactly as on picture. Not very clean (only the bedlinnen were changed, no vacuumcleaning or whatsoever), and dirty floor of the bathroom. Difficult to get a grip on the temperature of the shower. But the aircon, microwave, fridge, and some cutlery were a welcome addition. Friendly owner.[QWERTY123]Great location , few minutes walk to Central Park and Times Square . Shunichi was very accommodating with my travel arrangement. Very private but nice person.[QWERTY123]Shunichi的房子真的是位置非常好. 去时代广场或者市中心任何地方都很近｡我们非常喜欢｡[QWERTY123]Nous avons séjourné pendant deux semaines chez Sunichi, du 05 au 19 juin 2015. Il s'est montré disponible à notre arrivée puisqu'il nous a ouvert immédiatement en dépit de l'heure tardive (3h du matin environ). Après ça, nous ne l'avons que peu vu pendant les deux semaines, il s'est montré très discret et rentrait tard le soir. 
A la fin de la 1eme semaine, il nous a cependant proposé des draps et du linge propre.
A noter qu'aucune indication ne nous a été donné avant notre départ, et que nous avons du quitter l'appartement plus tôt pour laisser place au couple suivant, tout ça sans voir Sunichi.[QWERTY123]Me and my fiancee stayed there for 3 nights. 
The address is very easy to fine. We called Shunichi, and a friend of his waited at the apartment. The room is large enough (we had 4 pieces of luggage), clean, with everything you need in it. The bed is really ok, large enough for 2 people.
We felt really nice, it’s like a hotel room :). You don't see anyone around and the bathroom was always available. 
We’ve walked most of the time, the place is in a safe area and close to most major things to visit and see. 
This is really a great stay for visiting NYC. 

Thanks Shunichi![QWERTY123]As we were in a hurry to a dinner meeting with friends, Shunichi greeting us at the door and even carried my luggage up to the first floor. There's no elevators so make sure your bags aren't to hefty to carry up.  As a former New York resident, the room looked like the average apartment, although I have to admit that the pictures made the room looked cleaner and new.  I love that they were towels on the shelves, hair spray, and a microwave included.  Our stay was brief (8:30pm to 4am) as we were on a flight layover. We left our luggages and mostly roamed the city the majority of the night.  There's a small couch. The location was perfect as it is in midtown steps away from Columbus Circle.  Safe neighborhood. Great find! Worth the money.[QWERTY123]Appena messo piede in quella orribile casa mi sono venuti i brividi addosso ! Sono andato in vacanza in una bella citta' con tanto amore insieme a mia moglie ma poi mi sono ritrovato a soggiornare in una camera che non avrei mai immaginato che fosse cosi' ...muri neri spennellato di bianco finestra rotta dove passa l'aria e forse in inverno non sarebbe il massimo , frigorifero e microonde sporchi di nero, letto  quello di una vecchia prigione , parquet nero, piastrelle rotte. Forse per la camera puo' bastare , praticamente le foto che vedete dell'host risalgono a quando praticamente si e' costruito questo appartamento .Il bagno non ne parliamo il bordo vasco e' di uno spessore di 3 cm nero, e c'era una spugna che era in uno stato di putrefazione! Praticamente potevo beccare qualche malattia.Comunque non voglio allungarmi scrivendo quello che ho trascorso in 5 notti in quella orrenda casa , vi dico solo di stare lontano da questa casa e non accettate nemmeno se il prezzo e' bassissimo perche' la vostra vacanza sara' rovinata!!! Mi dispiace che non posso mettere le foto di quella casa ORRIBILE senno' non c'era bisogno nemmeno di scrivere , attenzione che io ho scritto questo ma in realta' e' molto peggio e dico cosi' perche' non ci potete credere se non vivendo l'esperienza che ho fatto io!!   colgo l'occasione per ringraziare i membri di airbnb che sono stati eccezionali! Prima esperienza (Website hidden by Airbnb) che posso contare su questo staff!GRAZIE[QWERTY123]Although the room was comfortable, and although Shunichi was a nice guy, no one was there when we got the apartment. We had to wait for over half an hour around the corner in a local restaurant....this is not something we wanted to after many hours of flying. It also seemed this happened to the couple staying after us but for a considerably longer time. Aside from that nothing bad to say. The location was ideal so if you do not mind waiting  then this is the place for you.[QWERTY123]由于原酒店临时涨价,经朋友推荐住了该网站此房间一晚,房间与照片想象差距较大,房间陈旧有异味,晚上经常有警车声音｡优点:地理位置不错｡[QWERTY123]Shunishi has been a wonderful and discreet host. He offered to come outside even though we got there quite late and carried our luggage upstairs. Before we left he agreed for us to leave the same luggage in his living room so we could explore more of the city. We loved the experience and stay there again any time[QWERTY123]Shunichi's place was perfect for exploring New York. We didn't see him much as he was working and we were so busy, but whenever we did meet he was kind and helpful. The place is about ten minutes walk to times square and this makes it so much easier, rarely having to get the subway anywhere. Great place to stay in New York for a couple of days.[QWERTY123]The room is quite big and comfortable. The only problem is that it was summer and the air conditioning wasn't really working so it was very hot and the tv didn't work. Other than that there was no problem. He was very nice about check in and out times, because I had a flight to catch after the checkout time and he let me keep the bags in the apartment so that was cool. The stay in Shunichi's place was good overall.[QWERTY123]這是間位於上城區的房間,地理位置非常的棒,無論是前往中央公園或是往下到時代廣場,都是可以走路就到｡房間內部也非常舒適,真的是值得推薦的好房間｡[QWERTY123]Our apartment building in Philadelphia caught fire, and much of our possessions were ruined and the whole building rendered uninhabitable by water damage the day before I had planned to stay with Shunichi.  So I feel asleep within an hour after arriving at his apartment and didn't wake up until the next morning.  Which goes to show that the room faces a quiet street and that the bed is comfortable, even if a metal frame.  The room is as it looks in the photo, with the additions of a table cloth, cups, mugs and a small mirror, without the plant, stool and dark full length curtain, now replaced by a shorter one that lets the light through it.  Shunichi was very communicative about my move in and had no problem with me coming earlier than I initially indicated,nor with me leaving my luggage at his place until I left the city the following day.  Then I crashed out.[QWERTY123]Non abbiamo mai avuto modo di incontrare il nostro host,non perché avessimo degli orari totalmente discordanti ma perché non si è mai palesato. Detto ciò è stato molto disponibile nei nostri confronti, abbiamo potuto lasciare le valigie presso il suo appartamento il giorno della partenza, abbiamo trovato lenzuola e asciugamani puliti, doppio mazzo di chiavi di casa, e al nostro arrivo ci aspettava una sua amica ad accoglierci. La casa e in una posizione centralissima, vicino a central park e Times square e alle fermate della metro, per cui ci è stato facile muovevi con comodità. È una casa che vale quello che paghi, cioè poco, ricorda molto la trasmissione televisiva ""sepolti in casa""! È ideale se usata esclusivamente per pochi giorni e per passarci la notte. Le foto sul sito airbnb molto probabilmente sono parecchio datate![QWERTY123]La nostra esperienza qui non è stata delle migliori ma devo dire che per quello che cercavamo noi ovvero un posto comodo e solo x dormire e lavarci ,era l ideale ,anche se le condizioni e l igiene non erano il massimo.
la posizione della casa a 2 passi da central park e a poche street da Times square , e il prezzo sicuramente basso rispetto a ciò che puoi trovare a New York sono sicuramente carte a favore di questo appartamento , ma per quanto appunto riguarda la pulizia non ci siamo :la stanza si presentava decente , a parte le tinture alla parete che non avevano un senso e la stanza risultava pitturata a metà , il caldo invivibile che non ci faceva dormire perché nonostante ci fosse una sottospecie di condizionatore questo girava l aria ma non rinfrescava la stanza , vi erano anche posate e microonde ma sinceramente non ci sono mai serviti quindi non li ho nemmeno guardati .
Il bagno si presentava alquanto sporco ,  la vasca aveva le tendine ai lati sporche di capelli e muffa e il lavandino e per terra c erano sempre capelli che non venivano mai raccolti . 
Noi purtroppo abbiamo avuto anche una brutta esperienza perché durante una delle notti che abbiamo trascorso qui , un coinquilino di 2 piani più sopra ha lasciato l acqua aperta di notte quindi questa è filtrata sugli appartamenti sottostanti nonché sulla nostra  stanza e oltre ad aver passato tutta la notte svegli per paura che le infiltrazioni facessero crollare il soffitto , l' indomani abbiamo dovuto dormire con una puzza tremenda da marcio perché i tubi dell acqua avevano lasciato sul soffitto un alone puzzolente oltre che delle crepe preoccupanti .
Se dovessi suggerirlo non lo farei , suggerirei piuttosto al padrone di casa di avere un po più di igiene e pulizia nella stanza che condivide dato che è un peccato data la posizione di questa[QWERTY123]We stayed at Shunichi's place for a whole week. We enjoyed our stay a lot! We did not see Shunichi a lot, since he has quite a reserved/private personality.

Let's start with the real good things; first is location, location and location. Perfect for the ultimate new york trip! We visited all the highlights; far locations like statue of liberty and yankee stadium by subway. All other things we did walking or by hoponhopoff bus. Also the flexibility of Shunichi is great; we had all the things we needed; a fridge, microwave, shower always available at our times, etc.

When reading the comments we noticed some comments about the pictures and cleanness. Well those are true; the room is maybe not as nice or clean as shown on the pictures, but what do you aspect for this rate? If you want a perfect room book a 4 star hotel for triple the price. This room is perfect for budget minded travellers (like us). The only times we were in the room was for sleeping.

We'd certainly recommend this location for those looking for this type of stay.



[QWERTY123]We spent perfect time in Shunichi apartment. The location is wonderful, we lived in the heart of the City! The room is rather big and clean[QWERTY123]Shunichi met us at the door, we arrived late and appreciated that he did not mind a late check in. Communications were good, having the back up of his friend available to check us in for before he arrived home was very nice. The room is basic, spacious by NYC standards, and clean. The perfect place to rest in a great location for our agenda. The bathroom sharing was fine and no issues. We had a very pleasant stay and were happy to be able to come and go as we pleased late in the evening.[QWERTY123]Shunichi was great.  He was very flexible with my schedule and quick to respond to inquiries.  He was a great host, and everything was accurately portrayed in the description and pictures.  This is a great location; I had time square and central park in walking distance.  Hands down 5 stars![QWERTY123]Greeted on arrival by polite host. Good sized well equipped room near Central Park and Times Square. Decoration a bit faded and some road noise (may be unavoidable in New York). Overall good value for the central location.[QWERTY123]The room was exactly as in the photo. The hosts were friendly, but kept to themselves throughout my stay. The room was simple but clean. The location was great.. Close to a couple of subway station and close to the Park. Not luxurious but a basic place to put your head down for the night.[QWERTY123]Shunichi's place worked out great for us. We found it very clean and spacious enough. It's central location also worked great for seeing everything we needed to in the city. I would definitely stay there again.[QWERTY123]This was our first Airbnb experience and I have to say it was exactly what we expected. Location was fantastic, room was very basic and we only used it to get some rest, and to shower. We felt very lucky to have found this place.[QWERTY123]Shunichi was very flexible with my check-in time and was so gracious to carry my suitcase up the flight of stairs.  The location was SO fabulous!  Incredible!  On the last day, I was reading the check-out instructions and saw that he wanted me to take out the garbage.  After 5 nights, I had 2 little bags and a pizza box.  Yikes, I felt badly, but didn't know where to put it and I had to leave around 4 a.m.  Hopefully not a problem.  I slept well and felt safe.[QWERTY123]He was really nice and understood that we needed a place to put our bags down for the day. The room was neat and clean as well. 

Our friend let us stay with them for the night which was a little more convenient so we didn't stay over Shunichi's place as expected.[QWERTY123]Clean, comfortable, and affordable.  We were able to easily walk to see a Broadway show and Central Park.  The subway was very close and easy to maneuver through the city.  Excellent choice.[QWERTY123]Shunichi had organised a friend let us in. She explained everything to us with no problems. 
We actually didn't meet him at all as it seems out schedules didn't match up (we were only in for one night)
The room was great as it was big enough for us to repack our bags before our long journey home. 
It was also clean and easy to get to being close to time square and central park. Would definitely reccomend to anyone.[QWERTY123]Not more or less than expected: the apartment was pretty large, we had everything that we needed during our stay in NYC and not to forget about the outstanding location!!! Within just a few minutes we were able to walk to the Broadway, the Times Square and to other important New York Sights. 
We would stay again with Shunichi![QWERTY123]Habia  muy poca  comunicacion pero lo que solicitamos nos lo dio.[QWERTY123]We had a great experience at Shunichi apartment, we arrived earlier than expected and he welcomed us and had the room ready for us. Room and apartment was clean and exactly as described. At checkout we left the luggage until late in the afternoon and kept the keys to pick it up.  The apartment is very well located few blocks from Central Park and Times Square. Overall a good experience, we recommend Shunichi apartment.[QWERTY123]The location is pretty convenient, Shunichi is very kind, he Is very reserved and you don't feel that anyone else is in the apartment.  If you are planning to hit all NYC (minimum time in the apartment) The price is excellent :)[QWERTY123]The apartment is right near columbus circle so in a perfect position, near the metro and Times Square so i really advice it for then position. We were welcome by a girl but after that we have never seen the owner so you have practically the house all for you (your room and the bathroom; we never used the kitchen). The room is just what you need as you probably will be always outside and use it just to sleep.[QWERTY123]Die Lage der Wohnung ist phantstisch! Central Park, 5th ave, Times Square, Empire States Building etc. sind innerhalb von 5 - 15min zu Fuß zu erreichen. Das Essensangebot in der Umgebung ist reichhaltig. Direkt gegenüber ist eine Parkgarage - interessant für Mietwagennehmer.
Die Wohnung selbst riecht sauber, die Böden, die Toiette und das Waschbecken waren stets picobello.
Die Wohnung befindet sich allerdings in einem stark renovierungsbedürftigen Zustand. Dies betrifft vor allem das Bad mit starkem Schimmelbefall rund um die schlecht funktionierende Dusche, sowie das desolate Gästezimmer. Die Wände sind rissig und fleckig. Die Sauberkeit rund um Mikrowelle und Kühlschrank laden nicht zur Essenszubereitung ein. Die Möbel haben ihre besten Zeiten längst hinter sich. Die Kopfkissen riechen wie das Basecap eines Teenagers. Bettenbezüge waren wahrscheinlich gewaschen, trotzdem voller Flecken. Wir haben uns eigene Kopfkissen und neue Bettwäsche gekauft. Fazit: wem der Zustand der Wohnung egal ist, und kein Problem mit Schimmel im Bad hat, sollte sich sein eigenes Bettzeug mitbringen und die tolle Lage der Wohnung genießen! Shunichi scheint ein ordentlicher Typ zu sein, obwohl wir Ihn nicht persönlich angetroffen hatten. Er war zwar ab und zu anwesend, scheint aber nicht am Kontakt mit seinen Gästen interessiert zu sein. Abolut O.K. für uns! Seine Katze ist jedenfalls supersüß und sehr viel kontaktfreudiger ;-)[QWERTY123]We loved the host's helpfulness and location, but not so much the lack of cleanliness in our room and the bathroom. The picture on Airbnb is quite misleading in this aspect. Though there were many amenities (fridge, TV, heater etc) in the room, they were all overed with thick layers of dust. The whole place smelled musty. The shelves were grimy, we had to wipe them down ourselves. There was also lots of hair strands on the duvet, but thankfully no bugs. There is also no lift, so if you have large luggage, it's quite a hassle up the stairs.

If the actual room had matched the clean looking Airbnb photo, we would not have taken issue. I hope that the host will either maintain a better upkeep of the room and bathroom for future guests.[QWERTY123]Shunichi war ein sehr freundlicher Host, aber die Wohnung war nicht wirklich einladend. Im Bad war sehr starker Schimmelbefall und unter sauber versteht man auch etwas anderes. Auch die Dusche war nicht wirklich zufriedenstellend , da die Temperatureinstellung nicht richtig funktionierte.Das Zimmer war auch nicht wirklich besser. Es befindet sich in einem stark renovierungsbedürftigen Zustand. Flecken an der Decke, dreckige Wände und auch auch der Bereich, wo der Kühlschrank und die Mikrowelle stehen, ist sehr keimig. Leider hatten wir im frisch bezogenem Bett ( wir hoffen es zumindest ) sowie auf den Überdecken lange dunkle Haare. Shunichi war aber so freundlich und hat die Decken dann ausgetauscht. Auch unter dem Bett waren Ansammlungen von Haaren :-/
Die Lage der Wohnung ist aber perfekt.
Wem Schimmel und Unsauberkeit nichts ausmacht, kann hier günstig unterkommen.[QWERTY123]Shunichi is a very thoughtful person. Too bad we didn't spend so much time with him (we stayed one night). But he planned everything for our stay in the bedroom he prepared for us. 
It was near everything in Manhattan (especially time square and hell's kitchen). 
It was perfect for our short trip.[QWERTY123]I stayed here with 2 of my friends for 2 days. The booking was for 2 people, but we had a last min change of plan and Shunichi was nice enough to accommodate 3 of us. 

The place, however, was not at all like the description/photos. It was an ok neighborhood, the stairs to the place were extremely dusty and smelly. The room was also very dusty and old. They also have a cat which was not mentioned. I am prone to allergies, and ended up having a running nose during the trip. Both me and my friend had sore throats by the end of it. 

We didn't use the kitchen at all, but it didn't seem very inviting either. The bathroom was just ok. I would probably not book that place again.[QWERTY123]Clean and large room. The location of the apt was superb! Really convenient if you want to catch Broadway shows. There are also lots of good food in the area. Shunichi was a very accommodating and polite host.[QWERTY123]Shunichi was kind from the little interaction I had with him. 
The only issue I had with the listing was that the room was dusty and smelly.
Also the room has a separate blower heater(not central heating), that needs to be kept on at all times in current weather conditions. 
[QWERTY123]The location is definitely fantastic and is the reason we choose to stay here. They are very quiet so you feel almost like they're not there.
Unfortunately, everything else (whilst as described) is pretty ordinary.
There was no one to meet us despite advising previously of our arrival time to JFK. We had to wait in the freezing cold for around 45mins and then when his friend got there to let us in, we had to wait while they prepared the room. They didn't change the top two blankets which was a bit gross. There was also a general unclean smell throughout.
The internet is slow (when it's working) and the shower is truly awful - you either get third degree burns or pneumonia.
It's a shame because the setup is pretty good, and the place could be brilliant with a bit of TLC - but then it would definitely cost a lot more.
In general, location is unbeatable but the accommodation itself isn't great.
[QWERTY123]Shunichi war ein höflicher und zurücknehmender Gastgeber. Der Raum ist einfach und funktional eingerichtet. Das Bett ist bequem und ich habe - trotz der Straßengeräusche - gut geschlafen. Die zentrale Lage in fußläufiger Entfernung von Central Park und Time Square ist ein toller Startpunkt für die Erkundung von Manhattan. Ich würde wieder kommen.[QWERTY123]I had little interactions with my host but he was nice and helpful when I did speak with him. Great and convenient neighbourhood.[QWERTY123]Although we checked in during the middle if the day, Shunichi graciously arranged for his housekeeper to let us in while he was working. The room and bathroom were very clean.  Although our schedules never coincided for us to meet, everything was just as expected and even more considerations, like extra bathroom necessities in our room if we had forgotten anything, tea and a hot water kettle, etc.  I will definitely consider staying again and will recommend to others.[QWERTY123]The host couldn't make me feel like in home because we were almost all the time outside knowing New York. But the neighborhood was very comfortable and the location of the room is convenient. I think that this is a good room for summer (because heating is not working very much) and if you want a room in Manhattan near some of the best attractions and at good price[QWERTY123]Veldig hyggelig husvert som lar deg komme å gå som du vil. 
Sentralt beliggende i midtown, og nær Central Park og Subway. 
Jeg trivdes veldig bra! 
Internettet kan være raskere, især om man vil sitte på skrivebordet å jobbe er nettet veldig treigt! 

Ellers enn det, var dette et perfekt sted å bo for meg da jeg skulle hit for å jobbe og søke inspirasjon. 
5 stjerner![QWERTY123]Sunichi was very hospitable, kind and friendly. The room was like the photo: comfortable bed to sleep and some basic utensils in case you want to eat some take away food. Both the room and the bathroom were clean. The apartament and host were very quiet. If we come back to nyc we'd consider staying there again[QWERTY123]El cuarto bien, practicamente no estas en la casa. Shunichi  no se siente, es como estar solo en el departamento. Lo mejor es la ubicacion y la calefaccion, lo peor la limpieza, hay bastante polvo. 
El baño un poco deteriorado pero se puede usar a la perfeccion, la cocina no la usamos. 
La zona es buenisima, con varios lugares para ir a comer y varias lineas de subte. Nosotros eramos dos y estabamos bien, si sos uno te sobra. El placard es enorme y la cama comoda. 
El WIFI no anda a la perfección pero te podes comunicar. 
Las cerraduras de la entrada del edificio son un desastre, muy difícil  abrir la puerta, mas que nada la segunda. 
Recomiendo esta habitacion dependiendo lo que busques, si es lujo aqui no lo vas a encontrar. 
Pero si vas a conocer NY y no estas nunca en la habitacion, solo para dormir, mas que recomendado. 

The fourth well, almost not at home. Shunichi not feel, it's like being alone in the apartment. The best is the location and heating, cleaning worst, there is enough dust.
Bathroom a bit run down but can be used perfectly, the kitchen did not use it.
The area is lovely, with several places to go to eat and several subway lines. We were two and we were well, if you're one spare. The closet is huge and comfortable bed.
The WIFI does not go perfectly, but you can you communicate.
The locks on the building entrance are a mess, very difficult to open the door, but nothing the second.
I recommend this room depending how you look, if you fancy here you will not find.
But if you go to NY and never know you are in the room, only to sleep, more than recommende
[QWERTY123]Unsere Reise war überragend.
Wir wurden zur abgesprochenen Zeit im Appartement empfangen.
Der Vermieter war sehr nett und zuvorkommend während der ganzen Zeit.
Das Zimmer und Bad entsprachen den Fotos und waren sauber und gut ausgestattet.
Die Lage ist Perfekt für eine NYC Reise. Wir konnten vom JFK Airport direkt mit der Subway bis ca 400m vom Appartement fahren.
Wir würden jederzeit wieder dieses Zimmer mieten.[QWERTY123]Partiamo dall'aspetto principale che rende la valutazione di questo appartamento positiva: la zona era semplicemente perfetta! In meno di 5 minuti a piedi si arriva a Central Park o a due differenti fermate della metro.
Per il resto l'appartamento è piccolo, spesso odora di chiuso e, non si può definire sporco, ma quanto meno poco curato e anche poco accogliente. Tutto sommato però se si usa solo ed esclusivamente come base per andare a dormire vale affidarsi al prezzo e alla convenienza della zona.
Per quanto riguarda Shunichi, è molto disponibile anche se molto riservato, per avere una conversazione con lui è necessario andare a bussare alla sua porta (ognuno valuti se sia un elemento positivo o meno!), ma per ogni problema è disponibile.
Le regole della casa, in conclusione, permetterebbero l'utilizzo della cucina in qualsiasi motivo lui non sia in casa. Noi siamo stati una settimana intera e lo abbiamo sempre trovato in casa, per cui se la vostra idea è quella di avere la possibilità di cucinare non vi consiglio questo appartamento. In caso contrario un po' alla buona, ma la posizione è ottima![QWERTY123]For my first bnb experience, I thought this was wonderful! Cozy little room in New York right next to central park. Our host was nice and helpful and made sure everything was set up for our arrival.[QWERTY123]Shunichi actually was away while we stayed so we didn't get to meet him really. He had a friend there to let us in and there was no issues with communication or the check in process.
The location is amazing, unbeatable for the price. The room has everything you need.
The room was neat and tidy although I think a new set of bed sheets are needed.
We would definitely stay again.[QWERTY123]Listing accurate-shared bathroom with host. Walking distance to many tourist sights. Good neighborhood. Host was available for questions and helpful with meeting us and working around our schedule.[QWERTY123]Gracias Shunichi por hospedarnos! 
El barrio es seguro, perfecta ubicacion con lugares accesibles para desayunar, almorzar o cenar. Hay farmacias y despensas muy cerca.
El cuarto es justo para dos personas,  hay una heladera, microondas,  pava electrica, tv y vajilla. La cama es doble, y se nos entregaron sabanas y toallas.
Shunichi es tranquilo y servicial. 
Si buscas lujo, no es el lugar, si solo vas para tener un lugar donde dejar las cosas, salir todo el día y volver a dormir, la relacion costo beneficio, es positiva.
Muchas gracias! 
Thank you S! to be our host. Everything was ok. Your house is a place to be in vacation! See you soon![QWERTY123]El anfitrión estuvo presente en el departamento todas las noches, pero en ningún momento tuvo contacto con nosotros, no se presentó y no nos dió la bienvenida, lo que fue bastante raro e incómodo. Fue una convivencia tranquila. 
A partir del cuarto día de nuestra estadía, el wifi dejó de funcionar y estuvimos sin internet hasta el último día. 
Las fotos publicadas no coinciden con el estado real de la habitación y departamento. El departamento se encuentra muy sucio, con acumulación de cosas en los espacios comunes, está desordenado y muy deteriorado, con mobiliarios rotos en la habitación, enchufes con los cables saliendo para afuera, el piso sucio y todo rayado, las ventanas sucias, la cajonera también rota. No es un lugar habitable, no volvería bajo ninguna circunstancia. De hecho las fotos publicadas al momento de mi reserva eran otras, las de ahora se ven mucho peor y la realidad es aún peor. El baño sucio, el agua de la ducha fue imposible de graduar, o fría o hirviendo, y mala presión de agua. La cocina nada que ver con la foto, muy sucia, con cantidad de cosas acumuladas, tierra y olor. Muy desagradable en general. El departamento está abandonado, sucio, desordenado, deteriorado. A pesar de pasar todo el día afuera y de la buena ubicación, no se justifica reservar este departamento para dormir, es imposible bañarse, usar el baño cómodo y dormir tranquilo debido al desorden y la suciedad, es muy incómodo dormir ahí, con un acolchado muy sucio y que no dan ganas de usar ni de tocar.
Aclaro que yo reservé el hospedaje porque leí muchos comentarios buenos, pero leyendo los comentarios de los últimos tiempos empezaron a aparecer comentarios negativos y ahora el mio. Lamento haber reservado, esos comentarios positivos no tuvieron nada que ver con mi experiencia.
La ubicación fue lo UNICO bueno del hospedaje, y no justifica su reserva. Aclaro que me he hospedado en hostels y lugares muy básicos y sencillos, pero cómodos, acogedores y limpios, no se necesita mucho pero si lo básico, y acá no lo encontré.
Lamento ser dura, pero prefiero contar mi experiencia sinceramente y que otros puedan evitarse malas experiencias. 
Y si me preguntan por qué me quede, es obvio, porque salir a buscar hospedaje era imposible por los costos elevados que se manejan en Manhattan.[QWERTY123]Simple room in a great location - close to many theaters and tourist attractions. Also many restaurants and cafes around.[QWERTY123]The location and hosts were great and super easy. Would definitely recommend staying here. The only downer for us was the shower only being freezing or boiling hot which was a little bit unpleasant. But apart from that it was perfect for us! Thanks[QWERTY123]Die Lage ist perfekt, das Zimmer und die Ausstattung sind ok. Allerdings wirkt das Zimmer auf dem Foto freundlicher als es wirklich ist. Und es war alles andere als sauber.[QWERTY123]Shunichi was very welcomming and flexible with checkin times, and he had arranged for a friend to let us into his apartment when we arrived during the day. 
We had an amazing time in NYC and the room fit our needs perfectly. The bed was comfortable, and it was easy to feel at home and relaxed in the room. Both the room and the bathroom had plenty of space, and was nice and clean.

The location in Manhattan was very central and close to many things, while still being relatively calm at night. We also found that there was an abundance of good restaurants literally right around the corner, which was a great luxury. The most difficult thing was to chose just one place to eat at after a long day of sightseeing!  

I would reccommend booking this room to anyone who wants to go to NYC, it definitely contributed to making our NYC experience amazing![QWERTY123]The large room, air conditioning, and location were all great. No problems.[QWERTY123]GREAT LOCATION! Near subway, bus station, lots of restaurants. You can walk to Time Square within 20 minutes.
The host is very easy to communicate and respond quickly.
The room is nice and tidy.
Great place to stay in New York![QWERTY123]There was a bit of a mishap with arrival but other than that the stay was perfect. It was close to everything and if you wanted to catch the subway it was only a few blocks away. The area and room were very secure and the air conditioning was amazing in the summer heat. Shunichi was very friendly and ready to help should I need it. Enjoyed my stay a lot and would definitely stay again :)[QWERTY123]My stay at this apartment was not the best experience, but if what you care about the most is a great location, then this is the place for you. The picture is a good reference of what to expect, although simply add an unpleasant layer of grime to everything and you have a more accurate idea. My main issue was that the room, while tidy, felt unclean and the bathroom was unpleasantly dirty, to say the least. The apartment looks really worn and it is right next to the trash room, so opening the door you smell the trash and it can be pretty disgusting. However, the inside of the apartment smelled fine. I appreciated that the room is independent of the owner's space, as a door separates the room and the bathroom from the living room and the owner's room. It was also very convenient that the room came with a fridge, microwave, toaster, and even plates and cutlery. It is pleasantly large and the bed was more of a full-sized futon. The a/c worked, but not very well, which is not an inconvenience unless one comes in the summertime like I did. Our host provided us with a room key, so it was nice to be able to lock the room and feel my stuff would not be disturbed. I didn't really see much of the owner, as a friend of his welcomed me when I arrived, and I believe that if I hadn't proceeded to ask him a few questions the one day I saw him at the apartment, we might never have talked, as he always left before I did and arrived apparently after. However, the main thing about this apartment is the location. Incredible location! It is walking distance from  Columbus Circle and all the theater area and Times Square, which made it very convenient when I got out of a play late at night. There are also a number of grocery stores nearby, including an organic whole foods style one. There are nearby subway stations and tons of restaurants, so it is easy to find anything one might need within a few blocks.[QWERTY123]Perfect location for the show I was seeing- thanks to the host for offering this.[QWERTY123]The person (host's friend) that was supposed to let us in the apartment at the schedule time wasn't there, so we had to wait almost an hour, until the previous guest open the door for us. That person was still in the room, sheets all messy, dirty towels on the bed...nasty view. The host was already on his way to receive us due to the fact that his friend never showed up. He apologized and was quick to ""prepare the room"". Honestly, the fact that we had to wait wasn't that big of a deal, hiccups happen. But the fact that after he prepare the room, it continued to look messy and dirty was kind of disappointing. To all of you looking to stay in NYC, be aware of Pros and Cons of this listing! Pros: location is excellent! Good neighborhood, very close to Central Park by Columbus Circle, lots of nice restaurants and shops nearby. This is what this listing is about. Also, he provided with maps, hairdryer, sun screen, scissors and that kind of essentials. There was a small working fridge, instant coffee, microwave and TV, which I don't know if they worked, never used them.  Cons: On the other hand, the room and bathroom were really dirty, mostly the bathroom. Guys, I had to grab a cleaning brush and a bottle of cleaning product that was next to the toilet to clean the bathtub floor, because I didn't dare to put my feet there, considering on how the rest of the bathroom looked. The sheets looked clean, but we didn't dare to use the towels, we just used small ones that we packed just in case. The cover on the small sofa was also pretty nasty. Honestly, this is not a place to stay more than one night, and that's why we decided to stay after seeing all this. If it would had been more that one night, we would have gone to our friend's house in New Jersey, which it'd had ruined all our plans. Bottom line: If you don't mind staying relatively cheap in the middle of the city, in a dirty place, this the listing to do so. At least neighborhood is safe. Otherwise, go to a different place, you got to be a care-free person to stay in a place like this, and have seen many dirty places to assimilate this. I come from a dirty 3rd world country, so there's that. But never expected this in an Air bnb listing, mind you, is my first experience :( Good luck to you all! 
P.S: The $15 cleaning fee are not being used towards that, I guarantee it![QWERTY123]Everything was great! Perfect location! So close to Central Park & Broadway. Also super flexible with leaving our luggage for the day! Good value accommodation. Thanks![QWERTY123]Flat very well situated, easy access by subway. The street is quite noisy. The room is nice, well furnished and we were very well received. Thank you![QWERTY123]My whole experience at Shunichi's place was perfect! Check in was easy. I just let him know about what time I was expected to arrive and he arranged a friend to let me in and provide me the keys. You can't beat the location. It's only a few blocks away from the Columbus Circle subway station, which is right next to Central Park. One block south is an NYPD station, so the neighborhood is fairly safe. Around the corner is Mariella's Pizza, which I highly recommend. There are several 24 hour stores in the area for your convenience. The room is very spacious and is perfect for one person, but it can accommodate two people comfortably. The mini fridge was very useful and the air conditioner worked adequately, especially during summer.  The bathroom was clean and functional and towels were provided. I stayed here for a whole week and actually saw Shunichi only one time and waved hello, so I had my privacy the entire time of my stay. I really enjoyed my stay here. In fact, if I ever do return to NYC, this is the first place I'll check to find a place to stay.[QWERTY123]Localização! o local é espetacular e de fácil acesso ao metrô e mesmo à pé para os principais pontos turísticos de Manhattan. O quarto é bom, o host te deixa bem à vontade, como se de fato estivesse só. Não tive nada a reclamar, me senti em casa. Chegamos e o local estava limpo e no quarto tinha alguns eletrodomésticos que com certeza auxiliaram na estadia. O único ponto negativo vai para o ar-condicionado, pois acho que estava sem manutenção, gelava bem, porém estava muito empoeirado, o que me deixou com uma alergia[QWERTY123]La habitación es como se indica en la descripción, con lo básico para pasar unos días en NY. La ubicación es perfecta para poder ir a todos los sitios céntricos a pie y bien comunicado con el metro.
El anfitrión se amoldó a nuestra hora de llegada sin problemas.[QWERTY123]Nous avons été bien reçu mais notre hôte était peu présent et on a un peu galéré avec la douche et la télé qui ne captait pas. L'appartement est très bien situé mais un peu vétuste. Y a moyen de trouver mieux pour ce prix je pense.[QWERTY123]I will divide the evaluation, so you have a better point of view. And I would also like to explain that I traveled with my boyfriend, and were all day out walking, so we didn't need to stay in the room during the day.

Pros: location is great, in the middle of the city. Shunichi is almost always out or inside his space, so you won't feel controlled. The bed was as announced and host offers a few more things as scissors, shampoos, some cuttlery, things that may come in handy. 

Cons: room is tidy, but is quite dark (curtains could be washed too). Air conditioner works, but makes a lot of noise during the night (and you'll need it in hot summer). Bathroom is clean as far as you can see, but if you glance a little further, you'll notice some dirty spots. My towel was a bit dirty also, I had to use my bf's. Apt is on first floor (consider that if you carry heavy luggage). What seems to be living room is stacked with boxes and things -I understand is his place after all, but it may shock you when you enter. And kitchen is definitely a no to use it.

However, Shunichi is very respectful and shy, so he won't mess around you but will help you get the best out your stay. Would return, if I make a similar trip.[QWERTY123]Nous avons séjourné deux nuits chez cet hôte. Il n'était pas disponible pour nous accueillir, mais une amie à lui l'a fait. Nous n'avons pas croisé l'hôte durant notre séjour. L'appartement est vieux et loin d'être luxueux, mais l'endroit est propre et très bien situé dans Manhattan. Vous ne trouverez pas d'hôtel aussi si bien situé pour un prix aussi bas![QWERTY123]The room is small but has everything you need. Close to Times Square and the subway. The host met us and showed everything. 
Комната аскетична, но есть все. Одна розетка не работает. Хозяина не видно было все время. С душем мы не подружились. Но это мелочи. Близко ко всему - это плюс[QWERTY123]Never saw Shunichi during our stay but saw his friend who let us in and it had everything we needed. Two young folks needing to stay the night on a budget in a safe neighbourhood![QWERTY123]Great place to stay in NYC. Close to everything in Manhattan.[QWERTY123]Great location, true to photos, however cleanliness of room could be improved.[QWERTY123]The location is amazing ! You're super close to Times Square and right in the city. 
We loved staying there.[QWERTY123]El barrio excelente. Falto limpieza.[QWERTY123]Quartier idéalement situé, proche commodités et visites à faire.
Par contre, logement vétuste, beaucoup de bruit la nuit, et peu entretenu...dommage aussi que si le café est fourni, il n'y ait pas deux tasses et deux couverts dans cette chambre pour deux...
[QWERTY123]Great location for any looking to explore Manhattan. I would definitely stay here again.[QWERTY123]Shunichi's place was perfect for my purposes. I needed a quiet place to sleep before the New York marathon. Check in was smooth. He's very quiet and private and we didn't speak or interact at all except at check in. 
This room is large and spacious and was perfect for a single traveler. It's a perfect location in Manhattan, close to everything you need. There's a small dorm refrigerator and microwave, toaster and hot pot in the room - much more than I expected. It's not a full kitchen but it was plenty. 
The bathroom is shared between the two rooms. Everything was great.[QWERTY123]He was nice but he don't speak English very well and i only see hem when i was arrived[QWERTY123]Shunichi's place is a relatively affordable option for NYC, and it fit my needs for a single night stay on a budget. The location was great, and check-in was convenient with his friend. My train arrived late to Penn Station, and his friend still met me despite the delay. I was able to leave my luggage until mid-afternoon on the day of check-out, which eased my travel around the the city. I did not use the fridge, microwave, toaster, nor A/C, and I did not enter the kitchen. As mentioned in the description, it can be noisy at night. I would also echo others' sentiments that the cleanliness could be improved.[QWERTY123]La ubicación es excelente, es lo mejor de hospedarse ahí, si lo que buscan es un lugar para dormir, bañarse y que este bien ubicado, esta habitación es perfecta para eso. Casi nunca vimos al anfitrión y cuando lo vimos fue muy amable, las imágenes de la habitación son reales,  buena calefacción. Estuvo todo muy bien, podría mejorar la limpieza del baño, pero estaba apto.[QWERTY123]Building was easy to find, Shunichi was very responsive to all of my text messages. It was extremely appreciated that we were able to drop off our bags early (the morning of our check in) and pick up our bags in the evening (the evening of our check out)! A good place to stay if you're looking for flexible times and the basics.[QWERTY123]Shunichi's place is in a great location and affordably priced. It is difficult to find such value in New York. While we did not interact much with him, he was helpful when we had questions. He also allowed us to leave our luggages there after check-out. If you are mostly out of the room and only back at night for rest, this room is definitely more than sufficient![QWERTY123]Perfect location and quality more than enough considering the price[QWERTY123]The location of this apartment is perfect! We have privacy in our room. The room has a small refrigerator, microwave and some kitchen stuff. The room was clean, although everything including the bed was very old. The only problem was the bathroom, It was very disgusting seeing different types of hairs everywhere.[QWERTY123]Mon amie et moi-même avons profité de l'appartement de Suchini durant 15 jours (du 26/12/16 au 08/01/17). J'ai beaucoup hésité pour la note entre 3 et 4 mais finalement j'ai tranché sur un 3 et je m'explique tout de suite. Tout d'abord parlons des points positifs : - l'appartement a une situation idéale, à 5 min de Central Park, à 10 minutes de Time Square. Le top ! On était à proximité de tout : de boutiques souvenirs, de restaurants, de fast-foods, de Columbus Circle où on peut faire ses courses facilement, bref parfait ! - la chambre est vraiment spacieuse (avec mon amie on s'est vraiment étalé, et oui on est des filles :p, mais on était vraiment à l’aise) et des équipements à dispo un frigo, un micro-onde, de la vaisselle, une TV (un peu sensible avec l'antenne), un Wi-Fi un peu capricieux parfois avec notre ordinateur, quelques nécessaires de toilette, des plans de NY à dispo... - la cuisine est à dispo et à tout ce qu'il faut pour se cuisiner des repas rapides (cela change des fast-foods à gogo :)) - la salle de bain est spacieuse également. Pas de petite salle de bain toute riquiqui, non il y a de la place dans la douche, pour se préparer, pour utiliser le lavabo… Mais malheureusement il y a quand même quelques points négatifs à retenir et pas des moindres comme : - la propreté en général. Nous ne sommes pas regardantes avec mon amie sur 2-3 poils qui pourraient se trouver dans une douche ou un grain de poussière dans l'appartement. Mais là c'était vraiment très limite, sans parler de la vétusté de l'appart, la salle de bain était vraiment borderline avec des poils, des cheveux, de la poussière par terre, le lavabo n'était pas nettoyé, je doute que le tapis soit lavé par exemple aussi. Et dans la cuisine, la plaque de gaz était grasse, noire de saleté... Dans la chambre, on aurait apprécié des draps propres entre ces deux semaines, le sol n’était pas vraiment propre, et le frigo n’était pas nettoyé. Bref nous étions vraiment déçues par rapport à cela. Et je reprécise que pourtant nous ne sommes pas difficiles en règle générale. - la salle de bain. En plus d'être très vieille (des barres de douche rouillées, des murs moisis, une vieille plomberie), prendre une douche était vraiment un calvaire. Une fois brûlante et une fois glacée, on arrivait à régler l'eau une fois sur 10. Et autant dire que c'est frustrant de pas pouvoir prendre une douche correcte quand on a marché toute la journée et qu'on est crevé. Enfin dernier point, plutôt mitigé - la communication avec l’hôte. Alors certes l’hôte est très discret et pour des gens comme moi qui préfère cela aux personnes envahissantes, c’était parfait. Néanmoins mon amie a regretté le fait de ne pas avoir parfois des infos, des recommandations (nous nous ne sommes même pas souhaités la bonne année, c’est quand même dommage quand deux...[QWERTY123]I stayed for one night to see a concert a Terminal 5 (just a 10 minute walk down the street) so the location was perfect. The room is not anything too fancy, but is very private which is all I needed.[QWERTY123]Very nice little room right in the heart of Times Square practically. It's close to everything and the host was nothing but generous and extremely kind. I will absolutely be staying once more![QWERTY123]Shunichi was easy to communicate and very responsive. Very convenient location to multiple places.[QWERTY123]The apartment is in an amazing location, walking distance to Broadway, times square, 30 Rock, public transport and anything else you could need. Shunichi was kind and helpful with any questions we had. The room was larger than expected and had all the things we needed.[QWERTY123]Great location, comfy bed, great price. Youre paying more for the location than the room. The room is not in the best shape but I was spent more time in the city anyways. Will recommend and will come back in a few months. Great stay.[QWERTY123]It's a perfect place to stay walking distance to the theater district and Times Square.?....Great restaurants...the room was quiet and clean...I will definitely go back and refer to friends..[QWERTY123]Chambre très bien situé (5 minutes à pied de Central Park et 10 minutes de Time Squares, 5 minutes d'un métro... Bref, l'endroit parfait pour un trip à N-Y à un prix abordable.[QWERTY123]This is really a super spot, ideal for a Manhattan visit.[QWERTY123]Quiet and affordable place! Easy to access and great host.[QWERTY123]Plus jamais ca ! Honteux !!! Des photos mensongères !!!
Une salle de bain avec une hygiène déplorable ! Je pensais que certaines personnes exagéraient dans les commentaires avant que je réserve, mais La j'ai des photos à l appui pour montrer la saleté inacceptable pour Airbnb ! Est ce que cette salle de bain est lavée un jour dans le mois ? Des cheveux longs noirs dans la douche, le lavabo, le sol toute la semaine alors que j en retirai de Moi même tous les jours ! ( cheveux courts pour ma part ! )
Des joints oranges, marrons de saleté cumulées ! Supports papier toilettes, barre de douche, étagères tout rouillé !!! Rideaux de douche sale !
Des traces de saleté sur le bord de la baignoire ... jamais vu ca de ma vie même au camping dans des sanitaires communs ! La fenêtre jamais lavée je pense ?! 
La cuisine: plaque de cuisson pleine graisse cumulée, plan de travail avec plein de miette, de reste d' aliments séchés. Pas pu l utiliser vu l'hygiène.
Dans la chambre: fenêtre tellement sale qu'on devine limite ce qu'il y a dehors, fenêtre qui ne se ferme pas totalement. Carreau du bord de fenêtre cassé en plusieurs morceaux.
L'hôte: vu qu'une fois dans la semaine quand j'étais dans la salle de bain, il est venu me déranger pour aller aux toilettes ! Pas la patience d'attendre que je finisse de me laver les dents ! Alors que l'on attendait des fois pour aller aux toilettes car le résidant qui dort dans la cuisine, squattait la salle de bain une heure !
Le seul point positif: l'emplacement !
Le seul point négatif de mon séjour: ce logement !
Jamais vu ca sur Airbnb ou ailleurs, louer son logement à ce prix avec une hygiène aussi déplorable, cela m a gâché mes vacances et cela ne devrait pas exister, quel regret d'avoir fait ce choix et d'avoir donné de l'argent pour recevoir un tel accueil, et payer de frais de nettoyage encore en plus !!!
J'ai des photos à l'appui que je vais transmettre au service Airbnb.
[QWERTY123]The house is located in a perfect area. The room is well equipped even though I almost did not use anything. It is comfortable and spacious. The bathroom is spacious and well heated. The relationship with Shunichi is just and necessary to be able to start using the room and then retire, which I think is excellent.[QWERTY123]Ble tatt i mot etter avtale, hyggelig mann, stille og rolig, merket lite til han. Rom og bad kunne ha vært reinere. Ellers et fint opphold med perfekt beliggenhet nært alt. Takk for et fint opphold.[QWERTY123]Shunichi's apartment was a great location, right in the heart New York. Walking distance of Times Square, Central Park and if you don't mind a 45 minute walk to the Freedom Tower. Lots of really good places to eat near by. Shunichi is very private and a nice guy. Bathroom could be a bit cleaner however everything else was great. Really good value for money. Would recommend.[QWERTY123]Shunichi is a reliable host who does his best to support his guests in all questions. Also the room is equipped with the most necessary things and even a helpful travel guide. His flat is a great starting point for all explorations whether up- or downton, just 4 blocks south of the central park.
Only drawback is the noise of the street, but I didn't really expect anything else in such a central position.
We really enjoyed our stay![QWERTY123]Great location, quiet host, the place needs some touch up with the price charged.[QWERTY123]We had a quick one night stay at this AirBnB. We arrived late afternoon, were out in the evening and left early the following morning. We choose this place because it is really close to the theater we were going to. Check in was hassle free, the room was perfect for what we needed for one night. Clean and tidy. The bed was really comfortable. We didn't meet the  host but his communication was always really quick.There was a bit of noise at night but it is the middle of Manhattan so you have to expect that. We left early the following morning so traffic noise wasn't an issue for us. Would recommend this place to a couple who want to spend there day exploring the city. It is really good value for money. I would stay here again. Thanks[QWERTY123]Perfect location! Great communication throughout our stay, very clean, and the bed is super comfy! Staying at Shunichi's made our trip so much more enjoyable![QWERTY123]Very good!![QWERTY123]The apartment was in a great location! It was four blocks from time square! We found a really cool burger place to eat at! The air conditioner was the disappointing part of it all. We got there before the sun went down and had to leave because it was just that hot in the room. No fan was available. It was hot in the city and very uncomfortable to sleep. This was my first airbnb experience.[QWERTY123]The location is great.  Shared bathroom. He has a microwave and refridge in the private room.  We did not plan for cooking in his apartment since it was a shared kitchen. Easy check in as he had a friend meet us.[QWERTY123]Bonjour,
Point positifs : l'appartement et super bien situé, à 10 min de centrale park et 15 de time square, le métro 8 min en direction de centrale park, commerçant pas loin et un petit commerçant qui fait mise à burger et café et leur expresso et bon et juste à côté à self qui voit laisse choisir vos plat à 7dollars la livre si je me trompe pas donc bien.

Point négatif :
La clé de la chambre et dur à faire rentré mais une fois trouvé la techniques c'est un peu mieux.
L'odeur dans le couloir et pas top mais mais dans la chambre ça va.
La wifi c'est horrible la réception et très mauvaise et se coupe.
La fenêtre de la chambre ne s'ouvre pas car une clim et installé c' est bien mais bon j'aurai aimé pouvoir ouvrir la fenêtre.
Dans la salle de bain il y a des poils et ça c'est pas cool, il sont par terre et parfois dans la douche mais pas énormément environ 3 ou 4 mais par terre beaucoup plus donc ça c'est pas agréable, mais pas la fin du monde pour la douche !!!!

Franchement je suis passer outre car vu le prix et l'emplacement je pense qui a pire mais l' hôte devrait faire un effort surtout qua ça prend 3 min pour enlever c'est poils, sinon l' hôte je l'ai croisé dans le couloir une fois et c'est présenté et à dit bonjour, pour l'arrivé c'est une amie qui nous a ouvert malgré le retard et ça c'est cool aussi.
C' est un bon rapport qualité prix quand même et le lit et très bien, le frigo aussi ainsi que le micro onde, une table deux verre et tasse que j'ai relever quand même la chambre et propre.
 voilà je pense ne rien avoir oublié. 
Merci quand même pour l'effort de recevoir les gens à toute heures mais faire l'effort sur les point noté.[QWERTY123]Location was perfect! Great value for money.[QWERTY123]Everything was great. The apartment is located near the central park and the city center. Flexible hours of departure and arrival[QWERTY123]You can't beat this location! Walking distance to so many amazing restaurants, bars, and great sightseeing! Shunichi was welcoming and gracious. We had an issue with our flight and he was flexible with our checkout time which helped us out a lot. Could not have been happier with our stay here![QWERTY123]Shunichi's place is wonderful if you are just looking for a place to sleep and shower in while you are visiting Manhattan. It is close to Central Park and Times Square. It fit my needs perfectly, as I was doing very touristy things and only was in the apartment at night. Shunuchi was very accommodating. My flight was delayed and I arrived to check in 3 hours after I had planned to and he was still very kind! He even allowed me to come back a few days later and pick up one of the shopping bags that I left there! I would definitely recommend Shunichi as a host.[QWERTY123]Logement tres vétuste : murs délabrés, infiltrations d'eaux anciennes, murs craquelés. La salle de bain est dans un état de saleté peu acceptable : poils dans la douche et sur le sol. Le lit est très moyen, la chambre très bruyante . Seul point positif : l'emplacement (a 10mn de time Square et de Central Park)[QWERTY123]Cheap room in a very good location![QWERTY123]Like most of the other reviews already written, I agree that this is in a GREAT location! I walk a lot and had no problems going to Pier 83 or the entire Central Park and Times Square. While it may not be the cleanest pla ce in the world, it certainly didn't raise any issues with me. If you want spotless living quarters, get a fancy hotel. Shunichi provided a comfortable room with a tv, DVD player(remote needs batteries), Small fridge, microwave oven, and other appliances such as a toaster, etc. There is also a closet and a shelf-system that is perfect for your clothes. Shunichi was very prompt in replying to texts when I got to town and near his residence. He helped me carry my luggage up the 1 flight of stairs and when I made an inquiry about salt, he was at my door within 2 minutes. And that was all I saw of my host the entire week. It was like I was all alone the entire week. Since I am not a Social Butterfly around strangers, it was perfect for me. Price was VERY reasonable for staying in NYC. Thank you.[QWERTY123]It was great I liked everything, thanks to Shunichi!!![QWERTY123]Great priced room in an awesome location![QWERTY123]Shunichi was great! He was very kind and flexible with our check in time since we were traveling from Boston on train. Our space was very tidy and clean and he was a gracious host. The apartment is within walking distance to Central Park and Times Square.[QWERTY123]The location is perfect!
Just in downtown and it's super convenient to go everywhere, time square, Central Park, broadway, Hell's Kitchen,I would recommend this house if you don't like to walk too much.[QWERTY123]Shunichi's place is in a great location. His friend checked me in and was very nice and made sure I had everything I needed. I would definitely stay here again if I decide to visit the area.[QWERTY123]위치는 진짜 좋습니다[QWERTY123]The room is quite large and Shunichi is very responsive. However the air condition is not very cool and the room is a bit smelly. The bed linen is not very clean there are a bit spots on it, but the bed is fine. The bathroom is okay but the sprinkler has mold on it, so as the ladder of the apartment.[QWERTY123]The location is fantastic - two blocks from Columbus Circle at the corner of Central Park, and right next to a variety of restaurants - Cuban, Mexican, Indian, Italian, etc. The subway stop was right there also.[QWERTY123]For $70/night a few blocks from Times Square....you can’t beat it. Here is what I found recently (mid October, 2017). 
Shunichi went out of his way (via text) to accommodate my late morning arrival (before he had a chance to clean from another guest who had not even left yet). I met him at his employment where he gave me keys and directions for setting my bags down in his living room. 
From Penn Station to his place, a taxi would normally cost about $10 (including tip). From Penn to his employment (opposite direction) and then to his place was about $30 total. Easy to walk the distance(s) if you do not have heavy bags to carry (I did). I would say his neighborhood is quite safe.
Basic needs are in the room. If you expect super basic you will not be disappointed, if you expect “style,” then this is not a place for you. I would say that is it clean “enough,” but I did not take a shower. 
Keys: the key to locks of both building entrance doors (2) are not well aligned. I struggled for a couple of minutes, almost called him (and I can’t really say what to do to get it to work). Key to apt. itself is fine.
Never having stayed in downtown NYC, I was interested to learn about noise. Sunichi’s place is about 6 houses in from a main drag (8th Street) and on the second floor. I was impressed with how little I heard from the outside (with the window open a couple of inches), only an occasional siren on 8th (main drag). I slept in until 8:30...sweet!
Would I stay there again? I would consider it, but I’d look around for another possibility, too.[QWERTY123]Was what I expected! Basic room but everything I needed. He provided clean towels which was great, and the door to the bedroom locked making me feel extra safe when I left my things behind to go explore. Had an issue reaching him at checkin which made me nervous, especially as I was a solo traveller in the evening, but once I met him and was able to checkin I felt super comfortable![QWERTY123]It is 2 floor , there is not  an elevador.[QWERTY123]He was really accommodating on my early flight arrival and late departure. His place is close to a lot of restaurants which was good since I am a foodie. If you’re not there is a McDonalds/ wendys across the street. His place is like 12 min away from Times Square. The neighborhood is safe to walk around.[QWERTY123]Nice and cozy. Excellent location.[QWERTY123]Very central, great room for the price. Host is very private, only saw him once when we first arrived which suited us great. Easy to organise and communicate with.[QWERTY123]This was a great place to stay and a great price for the part of Manhattan we needed to be in. Check in was very flexible, the room was well furnished, we had all we needed. Shunichi was good about being in touch with us. I highly recommend it![QWERTY123]Excelente ubicación!  La pieza es modesta pero amplia. El departamento esta muy desordenado pero es limpio. Nunca conocimos al anfitrión  aún cuando estaba en el departamento.[QWERTY123]Shunichi's place is fairly basic, however, it is in an EXCELLENT location (near supermarkets, coffee, laundromat, subway, liquor store, and walking distance to Broadway theatres and Times Square) and is good value for money. If you aren't looking to spend too much time there, it is a terrific option. Shunichi is organised and a good communicator, and we found it very straighforward. Would stay again.[QWERTY123]The location was awesome just a few minutes From Times Square and Central Park. The apartment is about what you would expect from a New York apartment, I totally didn’t mind it because it really feel like you are living in New York.[QWERTY123]Incrivelmente bem localizado. Tem tudo o que necessita...!!!! Recomendo...!!!![QWERTY123]Shunichi was very thoughtful and helpful throughout the whole process and was accommodating with changes in my plans![QWERTY123]Great location if you want to walk around Times Square. The room is ok if you are only looking for a place to stay the night[QWERTY123]Perfect location to explore NYC[QWERTY123]Great location for travelling arround New York city.[QWERTY123]Great place with amazing location ! About 5 minutes walk to broadway shows surround with lots of supermarkets and restaurants! great host thank you so much for going above and beyond with everything during my stay! There were no hot water for one night and one morning so I recommend to check before hand.Overall experience is great! Thank you for having me ! This is a great place if you want easy get around in midtown![QWERTY123]Highly recommended![QWERTY123]O lugar perfeito para aproveitar NYC. O local possui duas estações do metrô bem próximas, além de supermercados, restaurantes e lanchonetes. Como fomos no inverno, o proprietário nos disponibilizou um aquecedor elétrico. Nos deu muita privacidade, parecia que estávamos (Website hidden by Airbnb) certeza se voltarmos ficaríamos no quarto novamente. Melhor com custo-benefício, recomendo![QWERTY123]perfect location for sightseeing!! A deli supermarket is really close and I can get something everyday I need.[QWERTY123]La stanza è molto spoglia e la pulizia lascia a desiderare. Che c’è di buono è che è abbastanza in centro, e per la posizione che ha è molto economica.[QWERTY123]Host was extremely accommodating with early and late check in/out. Great location. Building and room a bit old and cluttered...reminded me of my back packing days in Europe![QWERTY123]Zurückhalten und netter Mann. Wir waren statt den gebuchten 5 Übernachtungen nur 1 Nacht dort, da es unzumutbar dreckig war. Schimmel wohin das Auge reicht im Badezimmer, verdreckte Zimmer im allgemeinen und der Geruch war undefinierbar. Es tut mir sehr leid aber ich kann nur sagen, nie nie wieder![QWERTY123]Desafortunadamente no pudimos conocer a Shunichi, nos hubiera gustado saber con quién estábamos compartiendo piso, el lugar no esta mal, pero en las fotos se ve mucho más iluminado y ordenado de lo que en realidad está. No tuvimos ningún problema, pero tampoco hubo nada especial que podamos comentar, lo único que destacó fue la ubicación, a pocas cuadras de central park y de times square.[QWERTY123]What a fabulous apartment! Perfect for the theatre-lover, as you are minutes walk from the best Broadway theatres. Shunichi gives you lots of privacy and the apartment is tidy and full of great touches. The listing is very straightforward, but I would argue that it’s better than the description! I recommend earplugs because there is street noise but you will get that anywhere in NYC! I will stay here again when I visit NYC.[QWERTY123]Excelente relación precio/ubicación. Estas a dos cuadras de Columbus Circle con todos los transportes a mano y cerca de todo y con Hell’s Kitchen a mano para comer todas las noches. Nos manejamos siempre a pie sin problemas. No pretendan limpieza o lujos pero si privacidad ya que el anfitrión prácticamente nunca estuvo presente. Ningún problema en particular y flexible con los horarios de checkin y checkout así que lugar recomendado (excepto para obsesivos con la limpieza a los cuales les sugiero pagar el doble un hotel)[QWERTY123]La ubicación es inmejorable, se encuentra cerca del Central Park y Time Square. Muy cómodo para moverse en subte.
El apartamento se encuentra en una calle tranquila, la habitación es para pasar la noche pero limpia y la cama es muy cómoda.
Al anfitrión lo vimos solo dos veces ya que trabaja todo el día.
Sin lugar a dudas volvería a hospedarme. Lo recomiendo 100%[QWERTY123]Location is fantastic, and Bread & Honey store around corner amongst others provides ample amenities nearby.  Street noise broke sleep first night, despite fan -- then I adjusted but, as noted, it's present.  Bed was fine and large room with closet and desk makes for a good situation.  Bathroom is the only other room you have access to, but kettle and small fridge in bedroom makes it workable.  As noted, this is basic -- think dorm-room style -- then remind yourself again about the location; neighborhood felt safe even at night.  2nd floor with lots of stairs but also high ceiling in room of this old building. Host was prompt on communication and exceptionally quiet.[QWERTY123]Shunichi was an accomodating, respectful and friendly host. The apartment is nice, in walking distance of Central Park, and public transport in all parts of town easily accessible. There's at least four Starbucks, a Whole Foods and several 24-h pharmacies/stores in close vicinity. If you want to see New York, this is an awesome homebase. Would definitely recommend and stay there again.[QWERTY123]As the description says, don't expect luxuries. The room is okay and the bathroom is not the best but it works if you don't expect much and are there just to sleep at night and take a shower. The host was barely visible so you don't have to worry about him being in the way. We didn't get to use the kitchen but we never asked either so we don't know if it wasn't allowed at all. Overall, the location is great. There are a couple of subways, restaurants and markets to buy breakfast nearby. Not far from Times Square and Broadway. Shunichi was great at answering all questions we had so I really recommend to stay at his place while in New York.[QWERTY123]Lo mejor la ubicación, excelente. La casa no es acogedora ni limpia, pero la habitación es amplia, esta ordenada y tiene un sofa sucio q cubrimos con una manta del avion para usarlo. Además de la ubicación, tienes absoluta privacidad, a veces no sabes si Shunichi está en casa, entras y sales sin problema. La cama esta muy bien y las sabanas estaban limpias. La ducha no estaba limpísima pero las he visto mucho peores, es aceptable ducharse ahí si piensas en lo barato del alojamiento y el sitio en el q está. Si vas a New York para estar todo el dia en la calle, y pasar el tiempo justo en el alojamiento para dormir descansar y ducharte es una opcion barata que te gustará. Yo repetiría! No es apto para príncipes y princesas pero estás en pleno Manhattan por muy poco dinero. Shunichi es agradable y muy escueto, tuvimos un problema con una llave y lo solucionó rapidamente. Todo fue correcto.[QWERTY123]Shunichi offers a place to stay in Manhattan without the huge cost. He was very accommodating for early checking and checkouts. Granted, it could use an interior makover, but it was comfortable, quiet and close to shops, restaurants, and the Subway.  I see it already booked for the rest of the year, so I recommend you book early for next summer.[QWERTY123]Wonderful location right in hells kitchen. Would definitely book with Shunichi again![QWERTY123]Shunichi was very nice and kind. 
[QWERTY123]Das Apartment zeichnet sich für Urlauber durch seine top Lage aus. 
Jedoch sind viele andere Dinge sehr dürftig ausgefallen.
Das ‚Schlafzimmer‘ war weitestgehend in Ordnung, von einem Wohlfühlfaktor konnten wir jedoch nicht sprechen. 
Im Bad schimmelte es überall, an der Badewanne, den Duschvorhängen und der Einrichtung befanden sich Schichten von Dreck, Rost und anderen undefinierbaren Dingen, was eine Dusche zu einem eher unangenehmen Erlebnis machte. Zudem fehlte an 2 von 7 Tagen warmes Wasser und im Bad befanden sich einige gebrauchte Überreste an Rasierern, Duschgels etc. von vorherigen Gästen - auch nicht sehr lecker. 
Die ausgeschriebene Küche war extrem verdreckt, was aber eigentlich keine Rolle spielte, da der Raum, in dem sie sich befand, nicht zugänglich und somit für uns nicht nutzbar war. Wir wurden in jenem Raum kurz ‚geparkt‘, als eine ‚Freundin‘, von ihm, die uns auch in Empfang nahm, bei unserer Ankunft erst einmal unser Zimmer sauber machte.. das aber auch eher sporadisch. 
Die Klimaanlage im ‚Schlafzimmer‘ funktionierte zwar, das jedoch eher halblebig; ein kühles Zimmer hatten wir jedenfalls nicht, und das sehr zu unserem Leidwesen, da es im New Yorker Hochsommer dringend nötig gewesen wäre.
Wir mussten ihm am Anreisetag nach mehrfachem Anschreiben hinterher telefonieren, wann wir das Zimmer denn jetzt beziehen dürfen. Obwohl er jeden Abend zu Hause war kam kein einziger persönlicher Kontakt zu Stande, was wir sehr schade und auch befremdlich fanden, da wir ja Tür an Tür wohnten. Check-Out Belange klärte er dann auch lieber über die App, sprich die Gastgeberrolle wurde hier nicht wirklich wahrgenommen.
Der Preis war für diese tolle Lage unglaublich gut, alles andere jedoch hat einen nicht zum Verweilen verleiten können. Mehr als ‚geschlafen‘, unser Gepäck geparkt und geduscht haben wir dort nicht.[QWERTY123]It was in an amazing location for a really good price![QWERTY123]Looking for a good place to crash for a few days at Shunichi's place is a good idea. Though it was very hot and hard to sleep, Shunichi provided us with another air con and it worked well. The bathroom had some stains, grime and mold. There were old curtains but it got the job done. The bedroom was dusty and dark but the bed was a good size and the host/host's friend provided us more blankets and pillows if needed. Overall, for the price and location, it's definitely a steal. But the cleanliness can be worked on.[QWERTY123]This is my first Airbnb stay and I am very satisfied. I felt safe in this location and my room was clean and spacious. I would request this Airbnb in my future trips to NYC.[QWERTY123]Excellent location to experience Manhattan[QWERTY123]La habitación estaba algo sucia aunque las sábanas estaban limpias. El baño estaba sucio, sobre todo la ducha (moho en techo y cortinas de baño). El pasillo estaba lleno de trastos y olía un poco a humedad (es un bloque de edificios antiguo). Por otro lado, Shunichi fue muy educado aunque distante, como si no estuviese en casa. Nos dio facilidades para dejar la maleta en el pasillo el último día hasta que cogimos el avión. Lo más importante del apartamento es que está muy bien situado (entre Central Park y Times Square). Si no eres muy escrupuloso por lo del baño (y te llevas unas chanclas), en general está bien para lo que pagas. Si eres muy fino, busca otro.[QWERTY123]Just saw sunichi once when he leave the Keys so we really didnt get the chance to Know him

The room is big and very well located, with microwave and fridge. 

A great bud get option for manhattan, near central park and times square[QWERTY123]Great location and value in Manhattan! About a 15 minute walk from Times Square and eateries around Hell's Kitchen.[QWERTY123]You won't find a better location (5minutes walk to Times Square) with many restaurants and facilities close by.
Shunichi let us come early and leave later and the check in was smooth.
The room had everything you need for a good rest and even a mini fridge for yourself. 
There was no problem about sharing the toilet with him, it was clean and always available when we needed it.
Shunichi was very welcoming and our stay was quite peaceful.[QWERTY123]It was best place to look around NYC. 
Easy access everywhere you want. 
If you are just traveler who don't really stay in the lodging, There are no place to beat its location. 
The apartment isn't insulated against noise. (NYC's old apartments don't have soundproofing, maybe?)
So I would recommend to bring earmuffs for non-sounds proof. 
Just without the night noise, It was perfect. 
And hard to see and meet him, so had asked things through using air bnb chat.  He would like to help us what we were asking.
I'd say the one of Big benefits  is reasonable price!
If I go NYC again, would definitely stay in there.[QWERTY123]Shunichi was very kind, he waited for us until midnight to check-in and was responsive. Great location and price. However, the room didn’t really match the picture. Towels and bedding were clean but the room itself was dusty, the sofa was greasy and shower curtains moldy.[QWERTY123]very convenient location, experienced host. take a closer look at the pictures before booking. definitely worth the money. couple of good kebab food joints nearby."	40.76488710301423	-73.98492985277313	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/5178	2	79.0	0.85
16	5203	"Emmie and her family are exceptional hosts. The room is very clean, comfortable, and private and the residence warm and homey. The apartment is quiet and a retreat from the city. It is located in a very nice neighborhood with many amenities (subway, bus, restaurants, and ample street parking. A very pleasant stay.[QWERTY123]Emmie and her family were wonderful hosts.  They are very friendly and accommodating.  I really enjoyed my stay with them.  The room is very comfortable, the apartment is very nice, and the location is wonderful; there are tons of restaurants and shops steps away, and they are very close to the 1 train to downtown.  
Definitely a five star stay.
[QWERTY123]The room here was great for what I needed which was a safe place to sleep. The family is really nice and helpful. I had a pleasant experience.[QWERTY123]A great place in a great neighborhood! Emmie and her family are wonderful hosts. I was welcomed into their home and immediately felt comfortable. A perfect place for a Columbia University parent to stay![QWERTY123]I had a great time with Maryellen and her family! They were very welcoming and helpful. Great location in New York and easy to get around. Will love to stay with them again![QWERTY123]Our stay with Maryellen and family was wonderful.  Maryellen is a most gracious hostess. She and her lovely family made us feel right at home. We will certainly stay again! Very spacious apartment and comfy linens - superb location![QWERTY123]My stay in Marryellen & family was great.I like the location and amenities around the (Website hidden by Airbnb) was a pleasure to stay in this warm family.Abi,she's so cute girl...I will certainly stay there when I visit NYC again.[QWERTY123]Wonderful. If you want privacy you get it, if you want interaction you get it. The entire family is very quiet. The room and bathroom are excellent, comfortable and clean. Nearby are plenty of good restaurants. The subway is a short and extremely safe walk. I will stay here again on my visits to new york.[QWERTY123]Great room, great host and beautiful family. I have never seen such a calm, peaceful family with even 1 child, let alone 5. You will be happy you stayed here. Everything is very comfortable.[QWERTY123]It was an enjoyable experience. The family was friendly and always ready o help you in any way possible. The kids are great! They are ready to help when you need it and accommodating to your needs!Have to say Maryellen's croissants are the best I have had! With its closeness to 1 line, her place is easy to get to and travel from to get to  most tourist places. and on Broadway most restaurants are really good! Would recommend her place to  others! Thanks Maryellen![QWERTY123]Just got back from a wonderful and comfortable stay with the Lehmann's! The particulars:
1. Location: ideal and a great neighborhood. we already knew we liked the upper west side of manhattan and now we really got to experience it like a resident. several great markets nearby, restaurants, etc. 
2. apartment: cool old pre-war style. lots of character. lots of space and comfortable.
3. the family: a great unit! we tended to be out all day and so we didn't get to interact with the family as much as i would have liked. next time we plan on hanging out some more! :-)[QWERTY123]Traveling by myself, staying with this family for 14 nights. Have been to NYC for 5 times and stayed at those dirty hotels in midtown before but I have to say this is the best experience that I've ever had. What a loving family. They always prepare sth in the morning, like croissants, coffee and Maryellen's chocolate croissants is amazing! Bed is comfy. Bathroom is right in front of my room. I got to use it a lot even though I was sharing with the kids. 4 Kids are very friendly and well behave. Abby, the 5 years old one is adorable! #1 subway is just 5 mins away and I feel safe even when I got home alone late at night. Would love to come back! If you are looking for a space to stay without paying too much and got to use a clean bathroom, here is the place for you.[QWERTY123]Nice family, comfortable rroom, convenient location.  I just wish I could have my own key for my stay. With a young family, I understand the issues, but it would have made sheduljng more convenient. Thoughtful of Mary Ellen to include robes and the croissants were a nice touch![QWERTY123]Dear Maryellen, thank you for hosting me! I really enjoyed staying at your home. Wonderful experience. I highly recommend. This was the perfect place for enjoying New York. The apartment was very clean and the room very comfortable. I'd love to come back and stay again.[QWERTY123]My stay with Mary Ellen's family was exactly as advertised! The family was very accommodating for my stay, and the room was very comfortable, particularly the bed. The kids were a delight, too! The tea and croissants in the morning were perfect.

The location was very convenient: two blocks away from the subway, a few more blocks to Columbia/Barnard. Just the perfect place to get my daughter situated at Barnard.

[QWERTY123]Absolutely super stay, Maryellen was EXTREMELY flexible when my plans changed at the very last minute and gave me a very warm welcome when I arrived.  The room (and bed!) was very clean and comfortable and whilst short, my stay was a pleasure.  I would strongly recommend both Maryellen's Hospitality and Airbnb :-)[QWERTY123]Mary Ellen and her lovely family were great hosts. I had a lovely stay with them. I was warmly welcomed and helped by Mary Ellen, her husband and also her kids. I highly recommend to stay in their quiet appartment. Great, safe location. Excellent bed, clean room. Exactly as advertised. Thanks for all Sarah, Rachel, Michael and Mary Ellen!! Hopefully I will stay with you again next time!!![QWERTY123]Very kind hostess, familial and warm atmosphere, independence, big appartment, good breakfast, good situation. 
No smokers.[QWERTY123]Séjour dans une sympathique famille américaine aux parents très investis dans l'éducation de leurs enfants. Mary Ellen était toujours prêt à répondre à une question, à trouver une solution à un problème, à suggérer une idée, à aider. Encore merci pour ce séjour !

I spent a very pleasant time at Mary Ellen's flat. She has a nice family and it is a pleasure to see how the parents are involved in the education of their children. Everyone was always ready to answer a question, helpful in many cases. Tx alot for everything !
[QWERTY123]Everything was purely and simply perfect: a warm welcome; a clean room; a very kind, helpful and flexible family; a good&safe location near the subway. Highly recommended.Thank you![QWERTY123]MaryEllen's home was safe, comfortable, and clean.  I was kind of worried about what a sublet would be like for my mother, but Maryellen's was great.  Her kids were sweet and well behaved, and her home was everything she said it would be.  Her home was full of good energy and her building was clean and uplifting.  Great neighborhood and close to a lot.  I think anyone would feel really good there.  MaryEllen was really helpful and we will request a stay with her again when my mom comes in town.[QWERTY123]Great family and great place to stay. Very much enjoyed my visit with Maryellen and her family again. Highly recommend Maryellen's place.[QWERTY123]New York is a great spot for vacations, and staying with Maryellen and her family makes it even better.

The location is very convenient next to the subway.

The family is really careful, I even got a early breakfast on one day.

I would recommend this charming family for any stay in the big apple.

Hope I'll go there again myself.

Thanks a lot.[QWERTY123]I was a bit affraid to come on my own to New York and at the Lehmann place everything was just nice: a warm welcome and a very kind and helpful family.
I really like the location which is close to the subway. Highly recommended.Thank you for everything![QWERTY123]AIRbnb is going to be my new way to travel.  Could not have felt more comfortable in the Lehmanns' home -- was like being with my own family. Location is great, especially loved being able to run in Riverside Park one day and then Central Park the next. Thanks for helping make my stay in NYC spectacular![QWERTY123]Maryellen and her lovely family have been the nicest hosts and made my stay very easy. I have been staying in NYC for research purposes and therefore needed a calm place to come back to in the evenings. And the Lehmann's totally provided such a place. It was always a pleasure to have a little chat with them over a cup of coffee in the morning and they all have been always very helpful in giving me advice for finding my way in NYC.
Above that I found the location of their appartment really comfortable (two streets to the subway station; safe area, 2 supermarkets, cafes, ATM etc right around the corner).
Thanks a lot!
Julia[QWERTY123]I loved staying with Mary Ellen and family. I am hesitant to let people know how AWESOME it was  because I want it all to myself....but something so wonderful should be shared.  It was clean, very safe, incredibly comfortable and the hosts were SO friendly and warm.  I can't wait to stay there again![QWERTY123]Excellent!  Mary Ellen and her family are awesome, the accommodations perfect![QWERTY123]I have stayed with Mary Ellen multiple times.  Some have been in her single guest room and other times in her guest apartment.  No matter which room you stay in, Mary Ellen is a wonderful host, the accommodations are VERY comfortable and clean, and her children are sweet.  I am looking forward to more stays with Mary Ellen and her family.[QWERTY123]Wonderful experience with the Lehmann family.  Would stay here again.  great location/convenient.  Mary Ellen is very communicative and helpful.

[QWERTY123]Once again a great stay at the Lehman's.  Each time I stay it is warm and welcoming, comfy and clean!  Excellent!![QWERTY123]From the very minute you enter the Lehmann`s apartment you feel an atmosphere of kindness,sincerity and comfort, which I find very touching.  Each family member (Mary Ellen, her husband, son and daughters) are always ready to assist you. The guest room in their Upper Manhattan apartment is exactly as it`s described by Mary Ellen, with a very comfy matress and cozy cotton blankets. 

Thank you very much, I enjoyed my stay and already miss you!

Anna[QWERTY123]I can only recommend staying with the Lehmann family![QWERTY123]Mary Ellen is such a wonderful host, and every our visit to New York is accompanied by a great place to stay with clean rooms and comfortable beds, and above all, by Mary Ellen's great hospitality.  That is why we simply love staying with her and her lovely family.[QWERTY123]This was my first time sharing an apartment like I did.  I found it very enjoyable and felt very safe there.  I was in New York by myself and I found everything very easily.  Maryellen was an excellent hostess and her locations was great.  I was only two blocks from the Metro line #1 which took me the whole length of New York.  I got some great information on how to get somewhere from Maryellen and her husband.  Her kids where great and very respectful, which was the greatest plus since I like children.  I would do this again.[QWERTY123]Another great stay...although they are always too short.  I don't think anyone could ask for a better host than Mary Ellen.  ALWAYS, ALWAYS so hospitable and kind.  I travel to NYC for work regularly and am so thankful to have such a wonderful (i.e., clean, friendly, safe, warm)place to stay every time.[QWERTY123]
I really enjoyed my stay with the Lehmanns. The family and kids were great. Everything was clean and comfy. The location was very convenient. The homemade granola was tasty, too. Couldn't ask for better.[QWERTY123]My stay with the Lehmanns was a brief one; I literally just needed a bed for the night, and I cruised in late and left relatively early the next morning.  But my experience was very, very positive--much more like stopping with an old college friend you stayed in touch with over the years than a night at a conventional hotel.  Sadly, I never actually got to meet Maryellen--our paths just didn't cross--but I did meet several other members of the family, all of them funny and brainy and welcoming.  It was a hot night, and when I came back after my night at the theater the AC was on and the room was cool.  I hadn't slept on a twin in years, but the bed was very comfortable and after a day of traveling I had no trouble falling asleep right away.  And I was provided with a couple of excellent cups of coffee in the morning (my breakfast of choice).  A great deal in a very fine part of town.[QWERTY123]Terrific place to stay in NYC. Warm and inviting. The Lehmann's are incredibly helpful and accommodating. I highly recommend staying here![QWERTY123]Gracious, warm and welcoming! My mother came to NYC to help me care for my baby for the summer and stayed with the Lehmann family. It was an ideal situation for her. She was welcomed into their home with warmth and kindness though also left to to come and go as she needed to. She has already been back and will continue to stay with them when she visits! Thank you very much![QWERTY123]Thank you for my mother's lovely stay! Perfect accommodation for mom's coming in from out of town![QWERTY123]To stay at the Lehmann family 's home was such a nice experience. They all are really cooperative, nice, funny and interested. The room is so beautiful, so you can really feel home. I am so glad to met them.[QWERTY123]Staying with Mary Ellen and family was great. It was just like spending the night over a friends place. The room was clean, and the bed was really comfortable.[QWERTY123]I had a perfect stay with the Lehmann family. They were so inviting and helpful, and the room was perfect (bathroom right across the hall), clean, quiet, private and the bed was really comfortable. The location is also great - a nice neighborhood, not far from central park and very close to a couple subway stops. If you're looking for an inviting place to stay when visiting NY on your own I would recommend staying here without hesitation.[QWERTY123]My stay at Mary Ellen's place was short but sweet ! I felt very welcomed and she was incredibly warm ! I was provided breakfast, the bed was comfortable and clean. Oh and one great thing : the subway was very close ! I highly recommend this apartment.[QWERTY123]This was my first experience with airbnb and I was very happy with how it worked out.  I felt awkward at first being in the Lehmann's home but they could not have been more welcoming or gracious.  The room was exactly as advertised and the location was perfect for me - so close to Columbia.  I highly recommend this room and am looking forward to staying here again.[QWERTY123]I can't say enough about how wonderful it is to stay with the Lehman's.  I stay with them about once a month and it is such a pleasure to have so lovely a place to stay.[QWERTY123]Although I was arriving 3 hours later than scheduled ( plane delay) Maryellen kindly welcomed me to her lovely home, showed me the room and handed me a key. There is a very friendly door man who helped getting the suitcase from the taxi into the elevator. The bed is comfy, the robe clean and cuddely and the coffee next morning was excellent. It was a special joy to meet some of Marellen's children and see them work on school assignments or hear them play the piano.
I went on a long morning walk in Riverside Park, which is just 5 minutes by foot from the house and later used the subway station 110/Broadway (just 2 short blocks). I felt very safe in the neighborhood.
Since my plane left late the following day I was allowed to leave my suitcase for later pick-up. I would gladly come back and stay with Maryellen's family again on my next visit to NY.[QWERTY123]The host canceled my reservation 92 days before arrival.[QWERTY123]I absolutely loved staying with the Lehmanns! They were helpful, friendly and just overall fantastic people. I loved feeling like I was part of a family during my first ever trip to NYC - and especially loved all the tips they gave me about New York through the eyes of true native New Yorkers. The apartement was fantastic! Very clean and spacious. Also, as many before me mentioned - the homemade granola was incredible :) I'm happy to say that I not only had a successful first airbnb trip to New York, but also made friends with the Lehmanns while I was there. I'll see you again soon! :)[QWERTY123]A wonderful place to stay!  The home-made granola is the best![QWERTY123]Another awesome stay with the Lehman's.  Highly recommend them!  Friendly, warm and welcoming....can't imagine there is a better host out there![QWERTY123]A perfect airbnb experience! MaryEllen and her family are kind, sweet, and friendly. The room is perfect, fairly quiet, and a small step across the hall to the bathroom which, despite four kids in the house, was available every time I had need.

The neighborhood is fun and interesting (with a hidden easter egg for Seinfeld fans. !! Don't miss it, around 113th and Broadway). The subway is a couple of short blocks away, so getting anywhere from there is quick and easy.

I'm looking forward to staying here again.[QWERTY123]MarryEllen and Mike have a wonderful family.  They opened up their home and staying there is like having a team of hosts in a warm atmosphere.  The children are hospitable, attentive and smart!  If something is needed there is always someone around to help, yet their home has the ambience of everyone quietly carrying on their business. The location is convenient for walking and public transportation and there is a wonderful fresh and healthy market just two blocks away.[QWERTY123]I had a wonderful stay at Mary Ellen’s place. The family is nice, I felt welcomed and the apartment is well located in New York if you want to visit any place in Manhattan.[QWERTY123]I had a great experience and really appreciated the attentiveness and friendliness of Mary Ellen and her family.  I was well taken care of and would definitely return again!
[QWERTY123]I had a great time staying with the Lehmann family! Even though I was out in the city most of the time it was nice to have a chat in the morning (lovely home made granola by the way!). Excellent bed in a safe family apartment, close to subway and in a convenient location (very nice part of Manhattan, though less busy than crowded midtown for example). Would warmly recommend staying here.[QWERTY123]I really liked staying with MaryEllen and her very nice family. They were helpful and friendly but easy-going. The apartment is neat and clean and I felt very save in the neighborhood. Any location in Manhatten can be reached easily. There were a fan and air-condition in the room and the bed was indeed very comfortable. I would definitely come back![QWERTY123]Mary Ellen is a godsend.  I got food poisoning during my stay, and she took wonderful care of me.  I can't get over what a kind hostess she is.  Believe it or not, I couldn't have been any more comfortable in my own house.  Thank you Mary Ellen!  I hope next time my stay is far less eventful for you![QWERTY123]I had the most wonderful time staying with the Lehman family. The room was cosy, the kids were great, and the apartment was easy to get to. I loved where I was staying in NYC and it was made possible by Mary Ellen. I was traveling on my ow be the girls Rachel and Sarah Grace were happy to converse with me whenever I was in the house. 
I really loved my stay in New York and I was made to feel kind of like part of the family and kind of like a New Yorker too. 10/10 would definitely stay there again![QWERTY123]This was my first airbnb experience. Had a 2 nights stay and it was great! Everything's as per advertised. It was an easy, comfortable experience. I was travelling alone, so safety was the most important consideration I had. I had no problems returning to the apartment alone at night around 10+pm via subway. The subway exit was next to a 24 hours grocery store, so even at night, there are people walking around and the path was brightly lighted. The building entrance has a nice, helpful doorman in the evenings and was brightly lighted, with working elevator. The room was private and cosy. Empty apartments just feel haunted to me.. so I really liked that the apartment has a lived-in family ambience (but not noisy, I could do work on my laptop in the room without any disturbance). Rachel (one of the daughters), MaryEllen and Mike were really nice, friendly and helpful, the rest of the children were cheerful and friendly too. Rachel and Mike were very good with directions, even providing detailed instructions with hand-drawn maps! Room and bathroom were clean and neat. If you choose to stay at MaryEllen's place, I'll suggest to take supershuttle service for airport transfers - from JFK was about USD 25 and to LGA was about USD 20.[QWERTY123]I had a great stay and Mary Ellen and her family were lovely - especially after I had to make some changes due to storm Sandy, everything worked out well in the end :)[QWERTY123]I have just stayed her place while 5 days. I actually had been living in this aria while long before moved to back to Japan. That is why This aria was perfect for me. It is very safe and convenience like just 20 minutes to get to Times Square. There are many good places to eat. Also, there some nice night places like Jazz live house or fancy bars. The room was very comfy. And it was completely private room. I enjoyed stayed her place and the neighborhood. Due to Sandy hurricane happened in NYC, I actually had to changed so many times my schedule. She was very flexible and helpful for it. Thank you Marry Ellen! I am defiantly coming back to in future! I am strongly suggest her place for your vacation!![QWERTY123]What a wonderful experience!  This family is terrific.  Being from a large family myself, having the parents and children around was a real treat.  In addition of having my own room, the kitchen was available for me to use and the bathroom was pretty much mine, too.  The true surprise was listening to the children play piano each evening - they are really good!  Next time I'm in New York, I will definitely hook up with Mary Ellen and her family.[QWERTY123]NY was a little overwhelming at first and MaryEllen's apartment was exactly the place I needed to recoup. The room is cozy, the shower is hot and the neighborhood is safe. I was even able to score some delicious homemade raviolis on their pasta night! Couldn't have asked for a better host family. Thanks![QWERTY123]MaryEllen was a fantastic host!  She was so flexible with me, and even accepted  a date that she did not list as available because it worked for my schedule.  So helpful!  Also the apartment is in a great neighborhood, 2 blocks from the subway.  Very safe area and doorman in the evenings.   The room was exactly as described, the bed and linens were very comfortable.  While I didn't have too much interaction with all of the family, the interaction I did have, they were kind and helpful and so polite!  I would absolutely stay here again![QWERTY123]I love staying here.  It's convenient, comfy, and I feel right at home.  The bed and sheets are perfect, the terry cloth robe is very cozy, and breakfast is delicious.  Mary Ellen and her family are wonderful!  Thanks for everything.[QWERTY123]After deciding that I was going to relocate from New Zealand to New York, I was hit with the task of finding safe, clean, and affordable accommodation in an incredibly overpriced city.  Finding MaryEllen's apartment was the best thing I could have done - the location was great, less than a 1 minute walk to a major subway line, safe, well-lit, very clean area.  MaryEllen's building also has an elevator which is such a lifesaver after all those steps you take getting around the city!  MaryEllen and her family are also so generous with their time in assisting you with advice on how to get to the places you need to be.  This was my first AirBnB experience, and it couldn't have been better![QWERTY123]I enjoyed my stay. The room was as depicted in the picture. The bathroom was just across the room, no clutter, clean. Providing a fluffy white robe was  very thoughtful and added to the cozy feel. MarryEllen and her family were delightful, I only feel sorry I was so busy that I did not have more time to chitchat a lit bit more. Additionally, the location of the apartment is great, just off Broadway, close to subway and restaurants. Very safe. Perfect for anyone visiting NYC. Thanks MaryEllen.[QWERTY123]A perfect place for this solo traveler...great west side location, a comfy room, gracious accommodating hosts...and the background bustle of their lively family.[QWERTY123]This is perfect for someone who wants a homey, comfortable and personable place to stay. I was warmly welcomed by Mary Ellen when I arrived, and had opportunities for nice conversations with other family members during the course of my stay. I had plenty of privacy and could come and go on my own schedule - no pressure to socialize. The room was comfortable; the location is incredible: just two blocks from Central Park and between Amsterdam and Broadway, so it's close to plenty of restaurants, coffee shops and markets, as well as very close to public transportation lines. And where else could I hear piano music as I got ready for my day![QWERTY123]I really enjoyed my stay at Mary-Ellen's.  In fact, I felt extremely 'at home' there.  She and her family were so welcoming and I had several fun chats with their eldest daughter who was also very helpful.  My early arrival was accommodated, I was free to come and go as I pleased and the home-made granola with fruit and yoghurt at breakfast was delish.  Mary-Ellen even gave me some to go home with, along with the recipe, which I just made for the first time back in Paris.  Thanks Mary-Ellen & co!  :-)  A bientôt...[QWERTY123]This was my first time using airbnb and everything went good since booking the room and effectively staying.
MaryEllen and her family were wonderful hosts.
The room and bathroom were exactly as pictures, very confortable bed!!!
Certainly I""ll be back to the house 
Thank you MaryEllen for all the help during my stay, you were amazing!,
Hope see you soon![QWERTY123]Very nice! I enjoyed MaryEllen's apartment,  the accommodation too was very nice! Thank you so much, all of you, it's been great! Bye![QWERTY123]The apartment was 2 subways stops nearby. It is just 20 minutes to get to TSQ. There is doorman. Beautiful the Cathedral of St. John the Divine 5 blocks away...Also my favorite place is Colombia university is also close. The campus is beautiful. Great Mexican, Cuban, Hamburger, cafe places are just close to the apartment. Safe neighborhood and nice host and cozy room. Everything was parfect!! I really want to back to their place again!! Thank you!!![QWERTY123]I loooove Lehmann family. This place is very confirmable for me. The room is perfect size for 1 parson. It’s a perfect cozy room with High sealing. This is second time I came back to this place. The reason is very simple. I just like this family and place is comfortable and safe. I just want to say thank you for always welcoming me!!![QWERTY123]MaryEllen was not home when I arrived in the middle of the day but her daughter took care of me and she was really helpful! I met MaryEllen later that day and she was really welcoming. The place was nice and clean. I would recommend this place to all and would stay there again![QWERTY123]Staying with MaryEllen and her family was fantastic! This was my first experience with Airbnb and I absolutely loved my time with them.  The room was clean and very inviting, the bed is honestly the most comfortable I have ever slept in, and even though another family came to stay in the other room during my stay, I never had to wait for the bathroom.  I felt totally comfortable coming and going as I pleased, and MaryEllen left croissants and Nutella for me for when I woke up since I like to sleep in on vacation. I loved hanging out with the family, and I got along well with all of the children-- such a sweet family! The shower was nice and tall, which was great for someone who is 6'4"" (the twin bed was a little short for me but that was my only complaint-- the footboard was low enough for me to put my feet over). The oldest daughter was very helpful when I arrived and drew me a map of the area and gave me recommendations for places to eat, and the whole family was very willing to answer the questions I had, and since I was fighting allergies, they let me have their Throat Coat tea with extra honey :) I would absolutely stay here again, any time![QWERTY123]I stayed here for New Years Eve and it was a much better alternative to spending $$ in a hotel! The subway was only a couple blocks away and I felt very safe walking to and from the subway. The entire family was very nice and welcoming! Mary and her oldest daughter were very helpful. Her oldest daughter took me to and showed me how to navigate the metro, gave some ideas on what to do on NYE and how to get there, and put out breakfast in the morning. The house was clean and quiet, and Mary had made soup so it smelt delicious as soon as I walked in! I felt like I had a lot of privacy and slept well on the bed - and I'm a pretty picky sleeper. I would definitely stay there again![QWERTY123]Over 150 good reviews-they know what they do, right?! I see why now.
I was looking for most importantly safe and convenient relatively subway place. It was a perfect match! 
I felt very home, relaxed and welcomed. I stayed in smaller room but honestly-it was totally enough space for my needs. Super comfortable bed, fan was chilling room perfectly or hot May nights (there is even optional AC if its too hot), I had closet and shelves for all my stuff, small table. Shower might  shared with another guest if someone is staying in bigger room, but it's clean and nice.
Very kind family members did leave granola breakfast and coffee every morning. They were so generous to help with advice, some medicine for my non-wellness and even made a lil card at breakfast table at my (Website hidden by Airbnb) the same time I never felt bothered and had as much privacy, rest and comfort as I needed.
Subway is literally 3 min walk; it's 15 min to midtown and 30min to downtown-it's amazingly convenient, there is no way you will be late or confused! In the area there are multiple groceries stores, places to eat. It also safe. When I move to NYC next year I will be looking for a place in same neighborhood. 
I will def recommend this place to all my friends-visitors of NYC. 

Thank you dear family!!!
[QWERTY123]Had a very enjoyable time here. Felt like I was very well taken cared of. Mary Ellen and her family were very gracious hosts. The location was great - very safe and near the subway. Really appreciate the breakfast that was put out every morning too! It just made the whole experience that much more sweeter. Would definitely stay here again :)[QWERTY123]This is my first time to visit New York and i feel so lucky to stay in Mary's apartment. The location is prefect convenient where takes 5 mins to Metro as well as near by west Central Park and Columbia University. The guest room is very cozy and clean that i feel like ""at home"". Mary's family is very nice and welcome to me! Besides, Mary is a good talent for cooking and i enjoyed the breakfast time with her adorable daughters Richel and Abbey. :)  Thanks Mary again and I would like to recommend to everyone who seeks for a homey, comfortable and personable place to stay.[QWERTY123]MaryEllen was a great host, very friendly and helpful. The apartment is located in a nice area on the upper west side, just a few mintues walk from the metro or less than $20  cab ride from Time Square. 
She left a light breakfast in the kitchen for me in the morning. The bathroom is shared with the other guests, if any, otherwise it is all yours.  I will definitely recommend her for your visit to NYC. Lovely stay in a truly lovely american family.
[QWERTY123]I am happy to report that all the information provided by Mary Ellen is completely accurate. I agree with the other positive reviews posted here. I will add that the neighborhood is very convenient and close to everything I needed (bank, buses, subway, Rite Aid, Starbucks, etc.). It is also very close to the Cathedral of St. John the Divine and to the coffee shop featured on Seinfeld. I would stay here again for sure. I had no troubles whatsoever and I was very comfortable. I will miss Mary Ellen's homemade granola! Thank you, Lehman family![QWERTY123]My stay in NYC wars certainly improved because I stayed with MaryEllen and her family. When I arrived Mary Ellen greeted me outside here door and made me feel very welcome. The room and bathroom were neat and clean, the mattress was just right. The air conditioner kept the room very comfortable and provided a noise screen too. Great neighborhood! I felt very comfortable walking by myself at night. I will definitely contact Mary Ellen for lodging my next time in NYC.[QWERTY123]I head a great stay in this cosy little room for my first trip in New York.  The appartment is perfectly well located, 3 minutes walk to the subway, I felt perfectly safe even at late hours. 3 blocks from Central Park. The room in itself is very clean and tidy, with plenty of space to fit your things in. Very clean bathroom as well, you share it with other guests if any. Breakfast ready early in the morning with some nice suprises every now and then (home-made blueberry muffins unforgettable !). Mary Ellen and her daughter provided me with useful advice and were always willing to help. I would definitely come here again.[QWERTY123]My living room was confortable and nice. The room is small but it has everything you need and the bed is fantastic! The bath you can use is right in front of the room and it is only for the host. The house is located very well, next to the subay and you can reach the main places very simply. All the family is friendly and respectful of your privacy. Thanks MaryEllen, to you and all your family! Bye![QWERTY123]Mary is very nice. She gave me the big bedroom and provided delicious breakfast for me. Big thanks![QWERTY123]I was moved into the big double room - and it was wonderful. The apartment is conveniently located near the subway, and near shops and a Starbucks. MaryEllen and her family were very welcoming - she provided homemade granola for breakfast and even made me decaf coffee when I requested it. The bed was comfortable and the room was nice and quiet, the bathroom was very nice. The only downside is that the wifi didn't always reach to the back rooms which made it hard to facetime my family at home. Great stay over all though.[QWERTY123]My host was wonderful and my stay in this cosy family apartment, and great neighborhood, was the best![QWERTY123]Mary Ellen is an amazing host. She has a great home and a huge space for her family. The room and bathroom provided is quite spacious. She is super generous with serving  breakfast in her dining room including homemade granola (very nom nom)[QWERTY123]I felt very much at home amidst the family activities.  The children were courteous, quiet, and friendly.  Mary Ellen was very hospitable and accommodating to my needs.  The location was absolutely perfect and I would stay there again.[QWERTY123]The stay with Mary Ellen and her family has been a wonderful experience. The room was very clean and the bed super comfy. My luggage didn't arrive, so Mary Ellen got my some supplies and got me some clean clothes. I appreciated that so much! Thank you again. The family was very friendly. And the cereal was delicious. I would recommend her room any time.[QWERTY123]This was my first with Airbnb and I absolutely loved it. The location is great, very close to the metro, easy to get by and around NY. Their home is lovely and very welcoming. I highly recommend it for women travelling alone. The family was extremely respectful. The bed is super comfortable. The wifi fast and reliable (important for me because I was traveling for work).
[QWERTY123]I couldn't have asked for a better experience staying with MaryEllen and her family for a couple of days. Her entire family made me feel welcome immediately and easily accommodated my presence into their home. The room is the way it is pictured; the bed is quite comfortable. I think MaryEllen chose a very good mattress! MaryEllen hospitable character also showed by providing tea or coffee and a very nice breakfast.  

The location is just a few blocks from Columbia University.  There are many restaurants within 2 blocks.  Great location, great accommodation, wonderful hosts.   Thank you MaryEllen and family.
[QWERTY123]Staying at MaryEllen's place on the upper West Side exceeded my expectations: probably one of the most convenient locations in NYC, and the apartment was beautiful. I got bumped up to a large room with its own bathroom, and the bed, towels, everything I used was high quality and comforting. MaryEllen and family were terrific hosts, knowledgeable about the city and interesting to talk to. I will definitely stay there again when I return to New York.[QWERTY123]MaryEllen and her family are wonder hosts. All very friendly, warm and inviting. The apartment is a beautiful pre-war building located very close to the subway and a number of places to eat. The clean guest room is just like home and actually is a home for this nice family. The light breakfast of homemade granola cereal and coffee is a real treat. Wifi has a strong signal and is very usable.[QWERTY123]What can i say about my trip with these family? Actually,one word is enough to describe them , AMAZING FAMILY ,they are friendly and good vibes! Also..the their home is so cool ,and very localized ,near the central park and stuffs..actually,it was the best host family i ever had,even it was just for 3 nights..but it was enough to know that they are the best..

ps:the breakfast is delicious! 

I hope i will stay there again soon! Kisses kisses!

Love 
Rodrigo[QWERTY123]Wonderful stay, I had homemade granola and croissants each breakfasts and French toast my last morning! I ended in a bigger room than expected, which was very nice and my own bathroom. Warm hospitality but still having my privacy. I totally recommend staying with Mary Ellen and family![QWERTY123]Once again a wonderful stay with Maryellen and her family

A cosy safe room just a few subway stops from the heart of the city

A warm tea always awaits you and delicious French toast or granola to begin your day seesighting

I just can't imagine going anywhere else in NY and I invite everyone to enjoy the Lehmann's hospitality[QWERTY123]MaryEllen is an amazing host. My friend and I stayed at her place for NYE. She made it feel like home. Thank you MaryEllen for all your help :) will def be staying at your place if I ever visit NYC again.[QWERTY123]I am so very grateful to have found such a cozy place to stay on my first solo trip to the big apple. Their home is almost as lovely as them! Tea, delicious sticky buns, and the coziest bed made for a fantastic stay. My only regret is not being able to stay longer![QWERTY123]Maryellen was a wonderful host, she went above and beyond to make my stay absolutely amazing. She responded to all my text messages. The place is very close to Mount Sinai St' Lukes if you are going to interview there. I would definitely stay again.[QWERTY123]Amazing value, perfect location for my NYC needs and great warm friendly family. Highly recommended![QWERTY123]It's a very lovely family. The room is clean and neat. 5 stars recommend![QWERTY123]Mary-Ellen and her family were wonderful hosts and their apartment is absolutely charming. I stayed for three nights and immediately felt as though I had been there before because of how comfortable the place was. It was lovely to wake up to the smell of toasted croissants and coffee every morning. Mary-Ellen showed me where everything was as soon as I arrived and was extremely accommodating to my check-in and check-out times. The location is close to several subway stations and not too far from Central and Riverside Parks. There are a bunch of great coffee shops around the neighborhood as well. If you're looking for a clean, comfortable, and welcoming environment then this is definitely the place to book![QWERTY123]MaryEllen's place felt like home and was always full of delicious smells. The room is simple with a small bed and desk space that is part of a large book shelf but roomier than I expected. I was visiting Columbia so the location was perfect. Very close to restaurants and the 110th St station to catch the 1 train. I didn't get to spend much time with MaryEllen or her teenage kids but I had a lovely time chatting with her husband and hanging out with their dog during breakfast. Definitely recommended for solo travelers.[QWERTY123]The whole family is amazing, including their sweet dog.
I will suggest staying with them to anyone I know who plans a trip to NYC.
[QWERTY123]MaryEllen is a very nice, hospitable person. My stay was very comfortable. Great location, clean, comfortable, not noisy- couldn't have asked for more.[QWERTY123]Hands down my favorite Airbnb listing where I've stayed in New York. Mary Ellen is easy to communicate with, and provides a very pretty, comfy room that's in quite a nice building. I got there late and left early, but the nice desk in the room helped me get some essays written for my classes. Definitely hope to stay here again for future city visits![QWERTY123]Welcoming space, clean, great location, comfortable.[QWERTY123]Great price for the room and location. My host went out of her way to make sure I arrived and that someone was there to let me in. Highly recommend.[QWERTY123]Great location, 5min walk to Columbia campus; fantastic people! Clean, cozy room in a spacious apartment. Freddie is probably the cutest dog you'll ever see within a 10 mile radius.[QWERTY123]If you're on this page and found availability for the dates you need, close the other tabs and just book it. What a fantastic experience this was all round. 

MaryEllen and her family (incluindo Fred, the dog), were fantastic, charismatic and super receptive. They give you your space (I had my own bathroom), and really make you feel at home.  

I am asthmatic and didn't have to touch my inhaler once, which is a huge deal for me. 

MaryEllen and her family were an absolute pleasure. They really were, and words really can't capture accurately how pleased I am with the experience. 

Thanks M.E and family

Tiago[QWERTY123]I stayed one week at MaryEllen's home. She and her husband were really flexible of checking in and out. During my stay I could come and go like I want because of my own key. As I was on the way all the time, we didn't see us so often, but nevertheless we had some nice talks. Otherwise the family accepts my private sphere, so I felt really well at their home. Also the family-dog Freddy is so lovely and good-natured. 
Coffee, tee, granola and fruits were available all the time. MaryEllen also made towels and a hairdryer available for me. 
Their nice, big flat is well-located at a subway-station and you can reach Times Square in about 20 min. The Central park is in walking distance. I felt safe at their home and in the surrounding area all time. So I can really recommend MaryEllen's home specially for single travellers, because I think you could rely on their help in case of need.[QWERTY123]fantastic. great stay and nice people[QWERTY123]If you are a lone traveller and need a place to sleep and drop bags safely then look no further. This place is on broadway and at walking distance to subway and central park. That's all you need to discover the top attractions of Manhattan. Mary and her husband Mike are very hospitable. They made sure that guy at reception is aware of my arrival to treat me well. They welcomed me right at the elevator's door and helped me with my heavy luggage. They even kept their dog locked so that it doesn't interfere with guest. There were few things which required their assistance like shower operation. On checkout the humble Mike again helped me with the luggage and saw me off until I boarded the cab. Thanks Mike n Marry for making me feel at home.[QWERTY123]I enjoyed Mary's flat a lot not only because of her hospitality but also because of all the family members' care. I would like to recommend this lovely stay for dog lovers and ones who wanna stay near the park and calm neighborhood with convenient public transportation. I would love to come and stay this place again for my next stay :)"	40.80177930332421	-73.96722945870876	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/5203	1	79.0	0.866667

Robin was a great host, attentive, available, helpful, and really came through for me and my family in a pinch. Loved it![QWERTY123]Six colleagues and I stayed at Robin’s loft for a weekend and we had a marvelous stay!  The loft was very roomy, cozy, and quiet.  The surrounding area was very safe. There was parking directly in front of the apartment, and it was only two blocks away from the subway which made traveling convenient.  In addition, Robin and her family were GREAT hosts and the price was unbeatable!!! I would definitely recommend staying at her loft![QWERTY123]Robin was a wonderful hostess, and her loft is amazing: beautiful, spacious, well-maintained and equipped.  Some mornings my family lingered longer than we needed to before heading out for the day, just because we felt so comfortable.  Robin also helped us out when we hit a snafu on the last day of our stay and almost missed our flight.  I would stay with Robin again without hesitation.[QWERTY123]I spent 3 weeks in this amazing loft! It's very spacious, beautiful, clean and very quiet! And everything you need is close by: quintessentiel Harlem, shops, restaurants, the subway. And Robin is very charming and a great host. I highly recommend it highly.[QWERTY123]What a trip!  Robin is the most gracious hostess In NYC.  Her SpaHa Loft was incredible, Spacious and the pictures do not do it justice.  Everything you need she has provided....Fresh Linens, Towels, Iron & Ironing board, washer and Dryer, a handy Instruction guide to access the Internet, Bus routes, Subway, you name it she provides. 

This was my first Airbnb experience and I must admit I was a bit skeptical, especially when my first host cancelled My reservation due to plumbing (Website hidden by Airbnb) the last minute........That is where Robin took the reins and was an angel to host myself and my daughter, The SpaHa loft is such a cozy space where you can relax after exploring the city.

Words cannot express how much fun we had!

Thank you Robin,

Shannon and Grace

We will definitely use the loft again on our next trip to NYC!

 (Phone number hidden by Airbnb)[QWERTY123]I'm a fairly regular visitor to New York, but this is the first time i've never stayed in a hotel. Six friends and I stayed in Robin's apartment and I have to say it was a fantastic experience. The loft is a huge home away from home with everything you could ask for. Robin was the perfect host, very friendly and helpful. If you want to experience the real New York, this is an ideal place to stay. Highly recommended.[QWERTY123]Robin's loft was gorgeous!! The space is amazing, modern, beautifully decorated and very comfortable. The location is also great, in Manhattan, 5 minute walk to the metro, close restaurants nearby. We loved the restaurant Amore Cubano. If you stay here on a Sunday, check out the Baptist church and their amazing gospel choir. Robin was also a wonderful host. She left us a lot of information about local attractions in her neighborhood. She was very friendly and even helped us find a salsa dancing place. Thank you Robin, we definitely recommend staying in the SpaHa Loft![QWERTY123]Robin's apartment is lovely! The pictures really don't do it justice - and it's so spacious. 

Robin and her family were the perfect hosts. The apartment is ideally located as well so it's easy to commute in and around NY. We'll definitely stay there again![QWERTY123]Thank you so much Robin.....We had a fantastic time in New York! We arrived late, Robin had organised agreat taxi service ride for us and they even turned up after our flight was 3 hours late-what a relief, we were so pleased to have that ride sorted at 10pm!!! Robin kindly bought food in for us also.  We spent most days out from 9am till 8pm got back and forward on the subway very easily. The apartment was huge and we had to walk down to talk to the kids in the bedrooms cause they couldn't even hear us yelling at them from the kitchen!!! The apartment has a fully equipped laundry such a bonus for travelers like us. Totally recommend staying with Robin! 
[QWERTY123]The loft was a great base for three execs doing meetings and business in NYC.  Just a short walk to the subway, all our meetings downtown and in Brooklyn were just 1 or 2 trains away.  Locally the area is full of life and has yet to be gentrified so you get a true feel of real life New York.  Robin was a wonderful host, greeting us as we arrived to run through the layout of the loft and brief us on local shopping, restaurants and answer any questions.  The loft is HUGE and provided more than enough space for the three of us, who has been travelling together already for a couple of weeks, so it was perfect layout that afforded the opportunity to get away from each other for privacy when we needed or to sit together and discuss business on the comfortable couches or at the large dining table.  The SpaHa loft was exactly what we were looking for and saved us a fortune on hotels downtown.  See you again next year Robin![QWERTY123]Robin was a wonderful host. We enjoyed ourselves immensely and would definitely stay there again. Spaha is beautiful and  in a location that is accessible to train and multiple types of food. Thanks you made our trip, which was really busy quiet and peaceful.[QWERTY123]Robyn's loft was amazing, spacious, well fitted out and great for a large family such as ours. Robyn was friendly and keen to help with anything, local knowledge she shared, a great source. Only a short walk to the easy-to-use subway.
Would recommend this loft to others very highly.[QWERTY123]Robin et son mari sont très accueillants. Le transfert de JFK à l'appartement a été organisé par Robin àl'arrivée comme au retour. Une organisation parfaite.

L'appartement est vraiment très spacieux et convient parfaitement à une famille de huit personnes, Les chambres sont calme. Cette situation est appréciable aprés des journées bien remplies. 

Nous voyagions avec un bébé et Robin nous a fourni un lit adapté. Tout a été effectué pour rendre notre séjour agréable.

L'appartement est entièrement climatisé. Les stations de métro sont proches de l'appartement et un supermarché est à deux pas. 

Notre séjour a été parfait. Encore Merci à Robin.
[QWERTY123]Sorry for this very late comment. In fact I wanted to keep Robin's place just for me !!!

Robin and her famille were really very nice to me and my family. This place is nicely located, clean, safe, and just a couple of metro stations for downtown. I recommend Robin's place with no restrictions.[QWERTY123]Dear George & Robin,
My family is very satisfied with your accommodation. Your place is spacious, private, clean, quiet, and most of all your service was extraordinary. 
Your accommodation and service had not only met our expectation but exceeded our satisfaction. I would recommend your place to anyone.
This is to all (Website hidden by Airbnb) not let ‘Harlem’ reputation or whatever you’ve heard about the area and environment hesitate you from consider of renting this wonderful SpaHa Loft. The area is safe!

Thank you so much,
Chai & Crystal[QWERTY123]Robin is the best, great appartment and good location. Worked very well for our group of entrepreneurs on a tight budget![QWERTY123]Staying at Robin's loft really made the trip easy. It's in a great location if you want to be away from the craziest parts of the city, but still have easy access to everything.  We were a group of 7 friends/couples, and we all really enjoyed it. Robin was great...friendly, but also left us alone to do our own thing. The loft is very open (as described), so just be aware that sound really carries throughout. It might not be ideal for a mixed group of early birds and night owls.[QWERTY123]Our small film cast and crew (about 7 people) stayed here for over a week in December of 2011.  It was a perfect location for us to spread out and feel at home.  Transportation to other parts of Manhattan was very easy via subway and cab or car service.  Robin had a binder full of great recommendations for food and things to do in the neighborhood and we took advantage of the kitchen and the takeout options in the area.    Two of us were older people in their 80s and this was a great building for them to stay in because the elevator made it accessible. Spacious, comfortable, relaxing, lots of sunlight in the afternoon, many different beds and fold-out couch sleeping options.  Only tough part for a group this big was that the walls aren't floor to ceiling in all the rooms so you have to work out some quiet hours.  Overall, a great place to stay and we would do it again.[QWERTY123]My family and I stay there for a bit mrore than a week and it was perfect. Clean, pretty and spacious. There're two subway stops closeby. It is not the nicest area in Manhattan but we didn't have any problem. The only thing to be careful with is that walls don't get till the ceiling and you can hear everything. However, it wasn't a problem for us. Robin and George were really helpful and nice. I would defenitly recommend Spaha Loft![QWERTY123]We had a week in New York at Robin's SpaHa loft - 4 middle aged Aussie women in East Harlem - no problem.! We were close to and thus used the subway and bus system. Robin was a terrific host and explained how everything worked, gave us detailed information on everything we needed and even directed us to the local Baptist gospel church for Easter. We felt safe the whole time- and we did come home at night after 10:00pm on occasions.
The loft is wonderful, comfy beds, lots of room, well appointed, excellent laundry and kitchen. Clean and quiet. All our expectations were met and exceeded!
Robyn was great - before we arrived she had emailed me and then arranged a driver to pick us up at the Airport - all of which was really helpful. 
I can't think of a single negative thing and if I were to go back I wouldn't hesitate to stay again.
It was a great experience staying there, we had a wonderful host and a wonderful time in the big apple![QWERTY123]We had a very nice stay in Robin's great loft. It is really huge and well equipped and very comfortable. We found a parking space directly in front of the door and there were several others down the road. A supermarket is directly around the next corner where we could buy everything we needed. The next Metro-Station is only a five-minutes-walk away.
At night the neighbourhood is really quiet, the only disturbance was the snoring of my fellow-travellers :-)
We surely would like to stay in Robin's loft again![QWERTY123]Robin's loft is the perfect place to spend your holidays in New York with your family. Robin is very nice and helpful. The apartment is as nice as it is shown in the pictures. Great experience![QWERTY123]Great location, tons of space! This apartment is very large with room for everyone. It is very conveniently located 5 short blocks from the 4 and 5 subway lines and 4 short blocks from the 6 line. You are located right next to a park, no grass but more a paved area with benches and lots of trees. Robin had a binder with many things to do in the area. I would highly recommend the BBQ place that is in the binder, it was delicious! Full kitchen made it very easy to bring home leftovers and cook a few meals at home. I would definitely stay again. Thanks.
This is a loft style apartment. The three bedrooms in the back are separated by walls but you can hear just about everything. Luckily, the extra room up front is perfect if you have a snorer:)[QWERTY123]Perfect spot for 4 friends to stay, sleep in their own room and have a nice place to come back to after a day on NYC.  Location close to where we were working, an easy cab ride. Clean loft, plenty of sleeping room, washer dryer, great communications with the owner - would recommend this loft to anyone.[QWERTY123]l'appartement est grand ( il y avait 7 adultes), propre et très bien situé; il possède tous les équipements et le confort nécessaire après de longues journées de marche pour passer de très bonnes vacances; Robin a été extraordinaire sur la communication lors de la réservation et s'est occupée de tout pour le transport de l'aéroport à l'appartement. je vous recommande cette location pour vos vacances. vous pouvez réserver les yeux fermés; merci encore.[QWERTY123]We had a great time at the loft in Spanish Harlem, despite being there for Hurricane Sandy!  Four of us were very comfortable in the four bedrooms and had plenty of space to ourselves.

We had to stay indoors for a couple of evenings during the worst of the weather but that was no hardship as we'd stocked up on goodies from the supermarket that is literally 30 seconds away.

Robin was a great host - checking back every now and then that we hadn't blown away - and providing a folder with loads of good stuff to do.  

The location is great, about a $20 cab ride from Times Square, or a 5/10 minute walk to the subway or bus stop.  You're also only 10 blocks away from Central Park.  On one of the days we walked from the apartment in to Manhattan (as the subways/buses weren't running) which was a fairly long walk but lots of good sights to see on the way.

We went to Ellen's Stardust Diner on 51st and Broadway quite a few times and had great fun with the singing waitstaff, the food was great too.

Would happily come back to this apartment next time I'm in New York and I couldn't recommend it highly enough![QWERTY123]Myself and my 3 friends had a wonderful stay at Robin's loft, I can only echo what the other reviews say - it is a very large apartment with loads of space and Robin is a lovely lady. It felt very comfortable and homely with a great kitchen and two bathrooms which was convenient. As the walls don't reach the ceiling it may not be the best place for a group with different timings to stay as the sound travels, but it was not a problem for us - it was just great to all have our own space and privacy which we would not have got in a hotel for the same price, by a mile!! Also it was great to be able to sit round a table together and chat, or watch TV together on the sofas.
The neighbourhood felt safe and there are loads of shops nearby - a little hint, if you want to get to Grand Central quickly, walk to the 125th subway stop and take the express train. This is quicker than going from 116th because that stops at every station.
I would certainly stay here again and would definately recommend Robin's loft, even to large groups and families.[QWERTY123]I cannot recommend the Spaha Loft and hosts Robin and George more highly. The apartment is fabulous - tons of space, great location near subway, supermarket, restaurants and shops, and in a quiet street. Robin and George are kind, generous and very knowledgeable. The perfect base for a New York City vacation.[QWERTY123]Our stay in NYC for Christmas was absolutely magical. Without this beautiful loft would not be the same, we felt like at home and on Christmas Day we were able to preparing the table with a delicious thanksgivingday turkey.
The house despite the generous size was very clean and the beds very comfortable.
The water in the bathroom comes out really hot and plentiful.
The shower was a moment of real pleasure.
Express line 4 is reached in a few minutes the most famous spots in Manhattan.
Robin was really a very nice host and delighted us on Christmas day with a delicious cinnamon pumpkin pie.
The neighborhood was very quiet. Don't listen to all the crap peoples say about Harlem!!!. It's a very lively and colorful neighborhood.
I would recommend Robin to anyone for your stay!!
[QWERTY123]We had a great time at Robin's apartment. After a long day of traveling Manhattan, we could come home and relax. The apartment has everything we needed,  after spending New Year's eve in Times Square, we had a great dinner all together. Robin and her husband were very nice and willing to help us. We absolutely recommend everyone to stay in this beautiful place.[QWERTY123]Une expérience formidable . L'appartement est exactement comme sur les photo. Sauf que c'est encore plus grand. Nous étions quand même 8 et le loft pouvais encore prendre 2 personnes. Les lits sont  très confortable et les chambre très spacieuse. Il y a beaucoup de rangement, une grande salle a manger. Le quartier est tranquille. Un supermarché juste en bas de la maison et beaucoup de magasin pour faire du shopping à bon marcher. Le métro est situé à 10mn de marche de la maison. Il y a une grande église de gospel à 2 ou 3 bloc de la maison en allant sur Lexington avenue. Robin est une très bonne hôte et disponible pour ces clients. Je conseille à beaucoup le Spaha Loft. Robin merci encore pour votre accueil nous gardons  de très bon souvenir  dans votre loft .[QWERTY123]we went there with family and friend  The flat is cleaned and really really awesome I wish I could have the same flat in Rome! 
shop, markets  metro, bus are so close to the apt. I want to come back there next time !
[QWERTY123]We had an amazing time at Robin's place- She offered organisation fot a pick up from airport and gave us helpful recommendations. The apartment was exactly how descriped and all of us can recommend this palce.

PS: When you stay at Robin's place you defenitely should go to ""Sylvia's Restaurant"" and on Sunday to the little church ""Elmendorf"" which is just  around the corner.[QWERTY123]Our stay in Robins loft was amazing. A lot of place, well furnished, a good kitchen, everything what is need is there. The loft was spotlessly clean. We used the spot for 10 days/nihts with 8 people. 
Robin is a very (very!) nice person which took care about us and our wiches. It`s easy to go to Manhattan downtown by the green line.
So I recommend Robins loft deeply as a accommodation![QWERTY123]Ma famille et moi revenons de New York il y a déja une semaine et nous avons passés des vacances inoubliables. Nous avons hébergés chez Robin au Spa Loft et nous avons été ravie . Aucune mauvaise surprise, appartement très propre et spacieux, de nombreuses chambres, de nombreux rangements, Située dans Harlem, quartier très sympa, des gens adorables. je recommande vivement cet appartement. Robin à été adorable et très présente.[QWERTY123]The SpaHa loft is a roomy, comfortable and well equiped place to spend time. Our hosts  Robin and George were extremely helpful in facilitating our visit, especially arrival and departure. Robin also provides a folder with great information about Spanish Harlem , it's facilities and eating places. I'd recommend following her advice generally and specifically wandering around to have a look at the  elegant brownstones surrounding nearby Mount Morris( Marcus Garvey) park in Central Harlem.[QWERTY123]Nous avons passé 6 nuits au SpaHa Loft avec nos 3 enfants.
Le loft est propre, fonctionnel et spacieux, exactement comme sur les photos. Robin a répondu a toutes nos questions par mail avant notre arrivée et a très bien organisé notre transport depuis l'aéroport. La ligne verte 4-5-6 du métro n'est pas loin et permet un accès rapide (10 à 20 minutes) aux principaux sites à visiter.
La climatisation était en panne à notre arrivée. Nous avons souffert de la chaleur, mais Robin a vite acheté des ventilateurs en attendant la réparation de la climatisation.
Nous conseillons le Loft !![QWERTY123]Un p'tit mot pour dire un TRÈS GROS merci à Robin et sa famille pour votre accueil. Je comprends maintenant pourquoi le calendrier de cet appartement est toujours complet.

Anne de Montréal, juillet 2013



[QWERTY123]L'appartement encore plus grand que sur les photos, ce qui est un véritable luxe pour vivre à New York ! La ligne de métro local (6) est à 2 blocs (5 minutes). Une des plus vieilles églises de New-York se trouve dans la 121 st (derrière le loft ). Pour les courses, une supérette à gauche en sortant de l'immeuble à gauche est très bien.
Idéal pour une famille nombreuse.
Notre hôte est très disponible et gentille et parle bien français.
[QWERTY123]Merci Robin, nous avons passé une excellente semaine au Spaha Loft, très confortable et très grand et propre !! Un supermarché est juste à coté pour faire les courses, le metro n'est pas très loin et la ligne traverse Manhattan donc très pratique ![QWERTY123]What very nice Hosts and a very nice Loft!   It was a pleasure to stay there as it was very convent to go downtown too!  
Highly recommend the Loft and the Host!  
[QWERTY123]I stayed in Robyn's accommodation recently with a group of 6 family members, and would highly recommend it. Robyn was a great host, friendly and easy going - she printed out tickets and emails for us a lot which was super helpful (thanks Robyn!). It was very spacious and having 2 bathrooms was a real bonus. I would recommend for a large group, as it has everything you need. Good notes of the apartment and local area were provided too. Location was fine for us, close to subway and easy to get to. 
[QWERTY123]The 'SpaHa Loft' is a fantastic family-friendly refuge from the hustle & bustle of the big city. Our Aussie family of six had a great time in this very spacious apartment. The neighbourhood is fairly grungy, but we never felt uneasy walking around with four young kids. It's a short walk to the subway, and Robin is a fantastic host who is keen to help out in any way possible. A supermarket is conveniently literally around the corner. We'd strongly recommend the Loft to anyone wanting accommodation for a large family or small group of friends.[QWERTY123]Nous étions 4 filles. Nous avons passé un magnifique séjour. Le loft est très grand, à 2 minutes à pied de l'épicerie et à 5 minutes d'un métro.  Robin est une personne charmante. Elle laisse un cartable avec plusieurs informations de choses à faire et de bonnes adresses. Nous avons eu un petit problème avec notre véhicule et son conjoint nous a conduit au garage le plus près.  Merci à vous 2 ![QWERTY123]We stayed at the SpaHa loft for a week, 7 of us.

IT WAS FANTASTIC.

First of all, Robin and George are extremely nice and very helpful people. George even greeted two of my male travelling buddies with a cold beer upon our arrival. Very apprecieted! ;)

The apartment is just as nice as in the pictures. And big! DO NOT LISTEN to any form of crap regarding the neighbourhood. Harlem is vibrant, coloufrul, and there are tons of nice restaurants and nice places nearby, a lot cheaper then fancy places downtown, but just as good!
We were delighted in every way possible. This fab couple even arranged transportation to and from the airoprt. (that we recommend!)

The Spaha loft felt incredibly homey, and i could not ask for more.

Thank you ever so much Robin and George for making our trip so memorable!!!!!!![QWERTY123]L'appartement est parfait, spacieux, lumineux, bien aménagé en tout point cohérent avec la description. Nous étions une famille de 6 et avons  passé un excellent séjour.
Le métro est très proche. Il y a un supermarché ""incroyable"" au coin de la rue.
Et surtout Robin est une hotesse adorable.
A recommander[QWERTY123]Nous avons passé un superbe séjour dans ce bel appartement, Robin est adorable et disponible. l'appartement est très confortable, calme et il correspond totalement à la description initiale, le métro est à 2 pas. Si besoin robin s'occupe de réserver un chauffeur pour l'arrivée et le retour à l'aéroport. Bon séjour.[QWERTY123]Merci Robin et Georges pour votre accueil très chaleureux.Visite du quartier avec Georges et sa fille à notre arrivée pourtant tardive!
Appartement très grand et très propre ,on peut y vivre et dormir à dix adultes sans problème!!
Quartier très agréable à Harlem,authentique,bien placé prés de 2 stations de métro(20 mn vers le centre)et les bus juste à côté
Supermarché ,café ,restaurants à proximité.
Robin habite au dessus de l'appartement et est toujours présente pour de bons conseils.
Spaha loft parfait pour passer un excellent séjour à New York

[QWERTY123]Nous avons eu l'occasion d'échanger plusieurs mails avec Robin avant notre arrivée, elle a toujours pris le temps de nous répondre ou de nous conseiller.
Toute l'organisation de l'arrivée au départ, que ce soit pour le chauffeur, les restaurants, les bagages... a été parfaite.
Robin et son mari sont des hôtes très agréables, à l'écoute et disponibles.
Nous avons passé un séjour extraordinaire et sommes ravis d'avoir fait leur connaissance.
Le loft qu'en à lui est spacieux, lumineux, on y trouve tout et même plus que le nécessaire.[QWERTY123]We really enjoyed our 6-day stay at the SpaHa Loft. Great apartment with lots of space. Our 3 kids all had there own room. Not the fanciest of areas maybe, but the address is close to supermarket, subway and bus. Robin is a very kind and helpful host.[QWERTY123]The loft was beautiful.  Very clean, well equipped and comfortable.  Robin and George were excellent hosts whose restaurant recommendations were spot on.  Getting around the city was easy from their location.  We thoroughly enjoyed our stay there. 
[QWERTY123]Nous étions 8 personnes dans le loft du 29 avril au 6 mai 2014.
Très bon accueil de Robin qui nous attendait à l'heure convenue.Magnifique appartement bien équipé  encore plus grand que ce que l'on peut imaginer par rapport aux photos.Commerce à proximité ouvert jusqu'à 22h.Sation de métro à 5 minutes.Robin, qui parle très bien français, nous a réservé un accueil chaleureux et était facilement joignable puisque elle vit juste au dessus de l'appartement.
Nous le recommandons vivement.
[QWERTY123]Myself and 7 other students stayed at Robin's place for a conference in May. The apartment was exactly as shown in pictures and we all had a fabulous time! Robin left a ton of super helpful information about where to go locally and the best ways to get around the city. She also set up a ride for all of us from the airport to the apartment!

We felt completely safe in the neighbourhood. Our only precaution was that we didn't walk out at night alone. 

The subway was relatively close and it took about 30 minutes to get to midtown. The travel time was the only downside... you'll definitely want to make sure you're prepared for the entire day before venturing out to avoid having to travel back and forth from the apartment.

I would definitely recommend Robin's apartment to anyone traveling with a big group or a family, looking to stay in NYC on a budget![QWERTY123]Très beau séjour, rendu d'autant plus agréable par la prestation fournie de cet appartement. Il est très agréable à vivre, très spacieux et bien équipé. Il est également bien situé. Robin et son mari sont charmants et toujours à notre disposition. Il y a beaucoup de choses positives a dire sur cette prestation mais tout a déja été dit dans de précédents commentaires et je ne ferais que les répéter. Je recommande à 100%.[QWERTY123]Fantastique. Le métro 6 est à 5 minutes à pied et il vous faudra 20 minutes pour rejoindre le centre de la 5° avenue. Le bus M1 est aussi à 5 minutes et descend la 5° avenue en 1 heure environ. 
Le quartier est sympa et vous pouvez renter tard en prenant les transports en commun.
Les supermarchés sont à côté, donc pratique le premier jour pour faire quelques courses.
Robin organise également votre prise en charge à l'aéroport et le retour dans des conditions avantageuses.


[QWERTY123]Myself and three friends stayed at SpaHa Loft for 6 nights as we were celebrating our 60th birthday. It was large for only 4 people (2 ended up not coming), but we loved having the space, especially the 2 bathrooms. It is in a working class neighborhood which makes it more interesting than staying downtown. Subway is very close and easy to use. We would definitely recommend walking in groups of 2 or more from the subway at night as the area becomes very lively. Another alternative is to walk down 3rd avenue from the 125 subway station as it was brighter and less sketchy. Having said that, we always felt safe and enjoyed the local restaurants. We were met by George (as Robin had to leave town) and he gave us lots of good information and was willing to help us if needed. The loft was very clean and the beds comfortable. There is a lot of street noise and we had the windows open so it was a bit noisy but nothing we couldn't handle. Kitchen is well equipped and there is shopping just around the corner. It was a wonderful place to stay and we would recommend it to anyone considering it. We bought the $30 7 day ride as much as you want Metro card and it was well worth the money. We also had the hop-on hop-off 2 day bus pass which is such a good thing to do. We took the downtown, uptown and night tour. We were thankful to have such a nice place to stay while in New York. Thank  you Robin and George![QWERTY123]“The best way to experience a city is to actually become a resident, not as a tourist. Robin’s loft afforded us the opportunity to interact with New Yorkers at a much better level than a doorman at a swanky hotel. The neighborhood is rich with experiences and loft is located within easy walking distance to the subway. Our family of five adults, originally 7, appreciated the cleanliness, layout, two bathrooms, expansive windows, and graciousness of Robin. She was so friendly and the notebook of ideas left for our pursuing told us everything we needed to know. We stayed for over a week and it was our best family vacation thus far out of the past seven years. Treat yourself and book today.” 

—My mother[QWERTY123]Nous avons adoré l'appartement ,il était très spacieux ,très bien équipe .
Nos hôtes sont super car présents à tout moment et très serviables.
L'endroit est sympa .[QWERTY123]Apartment was great! Very spacious. All amenities were provided as described. Neighbourhood was also good. Robin was very nice and helpful. All in all a wonderful experience and highly recommended.[QWERTY123]Really nice and very spacious apartment in an interesting neighbourhood with great public transportation and a fantastic grocery store around the corner. Check-in and check-out was smooth and Robin is a very charming and accommodating host.

Larger parties considering this listing should be aware that all of the bedrooms have open ceilings, so couples and light sleepers might be less comfortable. Some people in my group also felt uneasy in the neighbourhood after dark, so we usually ended up taking a taxi back after a night out.[QWERTY123]Notre hôte est très sympathique et a tout fait pour nous faciliter le séjour (réservation taxi pour nous chercher à l'aéroport, renseignements touristiques, etc...)[QWERTY123]Superbe appartement!
Merci à Robin pour son accueil. Beaucoup d'espace ce qui nous a permis de passer un séjour confortable à 7 occupants. Le quartier est populaire mais assez tranquille, près des commodités (petit super-marché, Bus Métro, Restaurants...) et à 20 minutes de ""Downtown"" en transports en commun. Nous avons vraiment passé une semaine merveilleuse.[QWERTY123]Quoi dire de plus sur ce logement? Tout a déja été dit. Pour être honnête j'étais un peu sceptique concernant les commentaires, je pensais que les commentaires négatifs avaient été enlevés du site mais non! On ne peut pas laisser de commentaire négatif concernant cette location! L'appartement est identique à la description,propre, grand et spacieux dans une rue calme et très bien équipé. Il y a même un sèche cheveux et un fer à lisser pour les femmes coquettes! Le quartier est très calme même si l'on est à Harlem. Nous sommes rentrés plusieurs fois tard le soir et à aucun moment nous avons été importunés. Le centre de Manhattan est à 25 minutes en métro, qui lui se trouve à 5 minutes à pied. Robin et son mari sont des gens charmants et de bons conseils. C'est une location que j'ai déja recommandé à des amis qui souhaitent partir à New York. Merci Robin.[QWERTY123]Loved our stay! NYC with some flavor. Robin and George were fabulous, available, and super friendly.

Near downtown express stop and several crosstown buses. Highly recommend SpaHa Loft. Do not be put off by the neighborhood ... Unless you're a princess :)[QWERTY123]Robin was an excellent host. Her communication was always quick and helpful. She arranged a taxi for us from the airport and greeted us on arrival.  She also made sure our arrangements ran well for our departure.[QWERTY123]Robin was great and very flexible in getting us the keys to check-in. The place was as depicted in the pictures and was very clean. Robin and her husband were both very warm and welcoming and also accommodated to us by letting us keep our luggage there as some family wanted to stay longer before flying out in the evening.[QWERTY123]We stayed for 4 nights at Robin her apt. Great location, very clean.
Robin was a gracious host, very responsive to our emails and the stay was easily arranged. Her husband George was very kind and gave us a lot of information about the neigborhoud and places to eat.  Easy to reach by subway and or bus. Supermarket and restaurants are near by. 
Our visit was really a great experience and we highly recommend this to others looking for a large apt.[QWERTY123]We were very welcome by Robin and her husband. If we had any question she was there for us.
The apartment was as describe on the pictures, a lot of space, very beautifull and very practical. The only little thing is that the walls of the rooms do not go up to the ceiling so there s not a lot of privacy.  
But we enjoyed very much our stay. The aprtment is very near the metro and a lot of commerces. Thanks again to Robin and her husband.[QWERTY123]Positives- The loft is very spacious and can accommodate large groups.  It was nicely furnished and about a 5 min walk from the subway station.  It's also relatively cheap compared to something closer to downtown.  

Negatives - It is about a 30 min subway ride to get downtown.  

Other useful information - It's about a $20-30 cab ride to downtown with no traffic.  If you're heading back late with a group, I would highly recommend taking a taxi over riding the subway.


[QWERTY123]Lascio questa recensione con molto piacere, perché siamo stati ospitati nel migliore dei modi. L'appartamento è ampio, spazioso e pulito. Eravamo in otto, ma non abbiamo avuto alcun problema anche grazie al fatto che c'erano due bagni e due docce! Robin e suo marito non ci hanno fatto mancare nulla e sono sempre stati disponibili a darci una mano. Tutto ha funzionato alla perfezione e siamo veramente grati ai nostri ospiti per averci dato la possibilità di trascorrere la nostra vacanza in piena tranquillità. Da non trascurare che Robin parla bene l'italiano, il francese e lo spagnolo oltre che l'inglese e questo ha facilitato la comunicazione. Il quartiere è tranquillo e non ci ha dato problemi, la metro era a sole 4 strade di distanza e spesso siamo andati persino a piedi dall'appartamento fino al central park in poco tempo. Grazie di tutto![QWERTY123]Proprietaria gentilissima e disponibile per tutte le informazioni utili, parla italiano. L'appartamento è spazioso e l'abbiamo trovato molto pulito. Colazioni e cene in casa, vicino c e' un supermercato fornitissimo. La posizione e' tranquilla e silenziosa, vicino a un piccolo parco e a poca distanza dalle fermate della metro e dei bus. Da consigliare.[QWERTY123]Robin was awesome!
Organised a pick up from the airport and gave a good run down of local shops and the closest subway stations.
[QWERTY123]Très très chouette appartement, dans un quartier super tranquille et seulement à 20 minutes en métro de Times Square et de la 5ème avenue. Robin et George sont des hôtes charmants. Une adresse à recommander! Vraiment![QWERTY123]Robin a été très présente tout le long de la réservation et a répondu rapidement à toutes nos demandes.  Les commentaires sur son logement et le quartier se sont avérés tout à fait corrects.   Le loft est bien placé à Harlem, à deux pas du métro. Bien qu'il ne soit pas au centre, il ne faut qu'une vingtaine de minutes pour atteindre Times Square.  Central Parc est aussi tout proche.  Un supermarché hyper pratique et très bien fourni se trouve à 50 mètres du logement.  Le loft offre tout le confort nécessaire pour deux familles.   Vraiment une très bonne alternative pour loger à New York à prix raisonnable.[QWERTY123]Our hosts were wonderful and the loft suited us very well.[QWERTY123]Lovely spacious apartment, with charming, friendly, relaxed and accommodating host. Everything we needed was already provided. Could not have been more straightforward.
[QWERTY123]Nous nous sommes sentis chez nous dans l'appart de Robin: il est conforme à la description, très vaste, lumineux et confortable.
Les murs ne montent effectivement pas jusqu'au plafond mais pour notre famille de 4, ce n'était pas un problème puisque nous avions tous les mêmes horaires.
L'appartement est très bien situé (sur la ligne 6 du métro).
Robin a été parfaite.[QWERTY123]Our stay in the SpaHa loft was wonderful!      Being a party of eight, the spacious four bedrooms and living area worked out great.  The apartment was stocked well with kitchen goods, full-size w/d, and plenty of towels.  The beds were very comfortable and the apartment is quiet during the night.....which is VERY IMPORTANT in Manhattan....also only a few blocks to the subway and the Metro-North train.
Robin was so very helpful and generous!  We had a series of unforeseen occurrences due to weather and flight cancellations, and she went out of her way to accommodate our stay.  I visit New York every winter and plan on staying here again.[QWERTY123]Nous rentrons juste d'une semaine fantastique à New York où nous étions logés (à sept) dans le superbe loft de Robin situé dans East Harlem. Le logement est tout à fait conforme à l'annonce. Spacieux, pour ne pas dire immense, situé au 1er étage à proximité d'un petit square (fermé la nuit) peu fréquenté si ce n'est par des écureuils, d'une école dans un quartier calme. Tout l'électroménager à disposition, une très bonne literie, un grand salon avec des canapés ""vintage"" pour accueillir tous les occupants, une grande et pratique cuisine, deux salles de bain bien utiles pour la capacité de ce loft et de grandes chambres, dont en effet les murs ne montent pas au plafond mais c'est ce qui en fait tout son charme. L'appartement est sécurisé et situé à proximité de deux stations de métro (116th street et 125th street) et d'un certain nombre de commerces .Bien qu'étant sur Harlem, nous n'avons pas senti d'insécurité même en rentrant tard dans la nuit. 
En ce qui concerne l'accueil, Robin était présente pour nous accueillir et nous présenter en Français s'il vous plait, l'appartement, nous conseiller sur les sites touristiques à voir, ... Pour notre départ,  elle a fait patienter le chauffeur de notre navette pour l'aéroport puisque nous avions quelques minutes de retard. Elle a été parfaite.
Une adresse que nous recommandons chaudement et vivement.grand merci à Robin et son Mari[QWERTY123]L'appartement est très bien, il semble encore plus grand en réalité que sur les photos! Il est très bien équipé, on s'y sent vraiment bien.
Robin est très sympathique, disponible et de bons conseils.
La situation géographique par rapport au métro est pratique : en 20 minutes à peine, par un train express, on est au cœur de Manhattan. 
Le quartier est calme en journée, un peu plus agité la nuit, notamment à la sortie du métro.
La proximité d'un supermarché est très appréciable.
Nous y avons passé un très bon séjour.[QWERTY123]Logement encore plus grand que ce à quoi nous nous attendions. Très bonne literie. Métro à proximité.Très bon accueil de Robin et Georges, qui ont été de bons conseils. Vraiment aucune critique négative à faire. En plus Robin parle très bien français ! merci d'avoir rendu notre séjour agréable. Sandrine[QWERTY123]Après un accueil chaleureux nous avons prit possession de cet appartement bien spacieux et pratique, une belle pièce à vivre pour partager de bons moments tous ensemble et des chambres très sympa.
Le quartier est très bien, le métro est a 5 bonnes minutes a pied et un magasin pour les ""ravitaillements"" est juste a coté de l'appartement.
A réserver sans hésiter et merci à Robin pour son accueil et sa disponibilité quand nous avions besoin d'un renseignement et en français si besoin est.
Séjour au top ;-)
[QWERTY123]We were delighted with this apartment and the warm welcome from our host. It's true, the place is huge, and provided an ideal space for my two colleagues and I to live and work. It is in a vibrant part of Manhattan with easy access to the centre and airports. Our host made sure we had everything we needed, and even offered to look after my suitcase after I'd checked out. One person described it as ""better than the Waldorf - Astoria"" - what more can I say?! Highly recommended.[QWERTY123]Nous avons particulièrement apprécié l'accueil de Robin qui a patienté malgré notre arrivée tardive. L'appartement est très calme, vaste,lumineux avec de beaux volumes et bien aménagé.Le métro est à proximité et permet de rejoindre facilement le centre de NYC en 20mn. Boutiques de quartier et petits commerces pratiques aux horaires étendus complètent le tableau de ce quartier populaire et animé, de jour comme de nuit.
Bref, que du bonheur dans un loft bien conçu et sympa pour passer un agréable séjour en se sentant bien chez soi .[QWERTY123]We stayed 11 nights -2 adults and 3 kids 14-17 yrs old.Super with allots of space.Great location with the nicest host couple ever. VERY helpful and fast answering on mail and cellphones.
Pictures describes very well the apt. Highly recommend.
In no time you will be down town by the express metro.
A super choice to go with this rental !!
Thank you George and Robin for a great stay. Fam. Bohman[QWERTY123]Un quartier où l'on se sent en sécurité avec une grande surface proche pour faire ses courses, c'est bien pratique et une station de métro sur la 116ème street, ligne n° 6.[QWERTY123]I stayed at the SpaHa Loft with 6 of my friends for a Central Park wedding. I don't think we could have chosen a better apartment. The loft was extremely spacious (especially for NYC standards)! It looks just like the pictures/description. We enjoyed the large dining table and sitting area. The separate rooms and 2 baths were amazing-although not at all private. Privacy was not an issue at all for us so it was no big deal. 

Robin & George were wonderful hosts who made our stay very comfortable. They even let one couple drop their bags off early since they got into town sooner than anticipated. There was a large map of the area with subway lines there to guide us which was very helpful. The loft is stocked with everything you could want-there was even a washer and dryer.

I will say that the loft is a bit out of the main city. It is close to subway lines which was nice and we would take the subway into town-about 30min to most places we wanted to go. The neighborhood has quite a bit of character. We felt safe walking around in the day time especially in a group, but I would avoid walking late at night. We took the subway late at night one time and while we were fine, it was a bit uncomfortable. I gave this loft 4/5 stars due to the location issues. But again, it was well worth it because of the quality of the loft.

Overall, I highly recommend this loft. I don't think you will find this high quality and spacious of an apartment for the price in NYC. We really enjoyed our stay in NYC and this loft was a great home base.[QWERTY123]Not as advertised!  The loft, while enormous, is very, very average in terms of comforts and amenities.  TV doesn't work (rabbit ears???).  Wifi not accessible from one side of the loft.  Towels were mouldy and smelled stale.  None of the bedrooms have doors.  Front door was dirty, as were some of the walls which made us question the cleanliness of the entire place.  The owners (who live on the third floor) have dogs, which bark and can be heard walking on the floor, are noisy.

The location in Spanish Harlem was great, but I've had many, many better experiences in NYC.  

Bottom line...try another listing.[QWERTY123]Robin und George sind extrem sympathisch. Sie haben uns herzlich begrüsst und waren bei Problemen immer erreichbar und hilfsbereit.
Die Loft sah genau so aus wie auf den Bildern und war grösstenteils sehr sauber und die Einrichtung vollständig und in sehr gutem Zustand. 
Die Wohnung ist sehr geräumig und eignet sich auch gut für eine Familie. Da die Zimmerwände nicht bis zur Decke reichen, ist alles ein wenig ringhörig. Die Umgebung ist schön und man ist schnell bei der Subway und dem Bus um ins Stadtzentrum zu gelangen.
[QWERTY123]Nous avons été reçus chaleureusement par George l'époux de Robin qui nous a de suite mis à l'aise si bien que nous nous sommes immédiatement sentis comme chez nous[QWERTY123]Merci robin nous avons passé un très bon séjour a New York! 
Le loft est très spacieux, parfait pour nous qui étions 7, bien équipé, propre. 
Robin est une hôte attentionnée, qui répond très vite aux messages pendant la préparation du voyage et n'hésite pas a apporter son aide notamment pour arranger le trajet aéroport-loft a un prix très abordable! 
De plus le logement est très bien situé: supérette au coin de la rue et métro a proximité 
En bref n'hésitez pas ce loft est vraiment parfait et nous le recommandons sans hésitations![QWERTY123]Nous avons passé un excellent séjour chez Robin, l'appartement a été parfaitement conforme a la description et a nos attentes ... et plus encore ; bien organisé, propre et parfaitement situé , et au calme, très appréciable après les journées a arpenter le bitume de Manhattan. C était un plaisir de rentrer dans ce cocon le soir pour se détendre. Avec les 4 chambres, chacun avait son espace de vie. Linge de maison en quantité suffisante, machines a laver très pratiques. Très bon accueil et des bons conseils pour le séjour de la part de Robin, toujours disponible, même avant notre arrivée, pour répondre a nos questions. Nous garderons un excellent souvenir pour ce premier séjour via Airbnb. Merci Robin !!![QWERTY123]Fantastic house for two families to explore New York.  Supermarket just around the corner and subway close by.  Being able to cook and wash our clothes was great.  Apartment very large and easily accommodated the eight of us.  
Lovely hosts.[QWERTY123]Ce loft est très agréable et correspond à la description faite. Robin nous a réservé un très bon accueil et a tout fait pour que notre séjour soit agréable.Ce logement est situé tout prés d'une station de métro permettant d'atteindre Manhattan très facilement. Le quartier est particulièrement calme et bien pourvu de commerces de proximité.
Cette adresse est à recommander. Si je dois retourner à New York je tacherai de retenir le loft de Robin[QWERTY123]We have had an fantastic stay in NY and this apartment!  The apartment was as big as the pictures (Website hidden by Airbnb) was even better☺ We were 5 adults and we have plenty of space. The beds were very comfortable and everything you may  need  in a kitchen was there.  The Subway was 7-10 min away and it was no problem at all to take the train wherever you want to go. Robin the host was very helpful.[QWERTY123]My friends and I stayed at SpaHa Loft for 8 nights in early October and had a wonderful time. The apartment was spacious, comfortable and quiet. It's location was close to the subway and in particular Robin and her husband were extremely helpful and gracious hosts. The only thing the place did not have was a big enough TV for the spacious living room and access to more channels would have been nice after a long day sightseeing. On the whole I would recommend the apartment when visiting NY.
Trish[QWERTY123]George met us when we arrived and was very helpful with info about New York and his neighborhood, Robin was out of town, but stopped by the next day to say hi, they were both very polite and fun people.
We had 5 in our group and we loved the loft, very spacious and clean, we used all the amenities, such as the coffee maker, refrigerator, iron and ironing board, the women loved having a blow dryer, lots of extra towels and linen, the washer and dryer were great, next time we come we will pack less clothes since we can wash them there.
Nice little store on the corner with everything that we needed, Patsy's pizza was just a few blocks away.
Robin arranged for transportation to and from the airport, which I highly recommend, it was a father and son team, and they were very punctual and polite, and got us to and from the airport without any problem.
Some have said that the neighbor hood at night was iffy, but I guess it depends on where you grew up, we never had any problems, in fact my wife and brother-in-law walked about 4 blocks to ""Little Mexico"" to get dinner one night with no issue, and we were walking to Patsy's pizza almost every night, which is about 4 blocks away, I always felt safe, and people overall in New York were very polite, I think we only ran into 2 people that were having a bad day and that was on the subway, we stayed from Saturday to the following Friday.
I highly recommend Robin/George and their loft for your stay in New York.
We also loved that this loft was smoke free.

Thank you Robin and George for a wonderful time/experience in New York and your beautiful loft, ""WE WILL BE BACK!""[QWERTY123]Robin et son époux nous ont accueillis très chaleureusement ! Mille mercis à eux pour leur disponibilité ! Nous nous sommes immédiatement sentis à l'aise dans ce magnifique loft qui offre énormément de place et de commodités. La tranquillité et la facilité d'accès  au loft (conseillé via Third Avenue, et non pas Lexington Av., pour plus de sécurité) sont des points positifs. Son emplacement le long de la ligne de métro no 6 est idéale. Rejoindre le Sud de Manhattan est une affaire de moins de 30 min, sans changement ! Un supermarché se trouve à quelques pas du loft... très pratique.
Nous avons séjourné une semaine à NY avec nos trois ados. Ce fut une merveilleuse semaine.[QWERTY123]Very nice loft, good position, everything has been perfect. Robin is a super available person, very kind and cool.[QWERTY123]J'ai l'impression de répéter les nombreux commentaires positifs, mais c'est vrai que tout dans cet appartement est parfait. D'abord il est vraiment très grand et convivial avec une vraie grande table. Les chambres sont grandes, il y a beaucoup de rangements et tout l'équipement nécessaire. Pour notre groupe de 8 adultes en 2 familles c'était idéal. Le fait que les cloisons ne sont pas entièrement fermées ne nous a pas du tout gêné. Ensuite, il est très calme, ce qui est rare à Manhattan, tout en étant vraiment proche du centre, le métro étant à deux pas. Comme cela a été dit, il y a un supermarché très pratique juste au coin de la rue ouvert 24h/24 avec tout ce qu'il faut. Enfin nos hotes Robin et George sont vraiment charmants, Robin parle français, elle s'est occupée de notre transfert depuis JFK, et nous a attendue avec le sourire malgré nos 3 heures de retard d'avion jusqu'à plus de 23h alors qu'elle et son mari partaient en voyage le lendemain matin. Le jour de notre départ, nous avons pu aussi laisser nos 8 valises jusque dans l'après midi car notre vol était en soirée. En résumé, notre séjour a été parfait, et si nous revenons à New York, c'est sûr que nous y retournerons.[QWERTY123]I was in constant contact with Robin during the build up to my trip to New York.  In which she was was more than happy to answer any questions and assist with transport to and from the apartment.

On arrival we were greeted and given a tour of the premises by George.  We received a warm welcome and some great advice (seeing as we arrived during Weather Storm Jonas).

Robin also provides a great welcome pack manual of places to eat/shop which became really useful on days we did not want to venture out of Harlem.

The apartment itself was a lot bigger then expected :)

The experience in total was wonderful for me and my group of friends visiting from London.[QWERTY123]Casa totalmente recomendable.
Muy amplia y cómoda con los servicios necesarios incluidos. El barrio tranquilo y seguro con tiendas 24 horas  al doblar la calle.
Robin una persona muy amable y solícita.
Si necesitan transporte hasta la casa, Robin les puede ayudar, nosotros lo cogimos y también lo recomendamos.[QWERTY123]We had a fantastic week in New York and the apartment was a great starting point for our daily adventures. We ended up spending more time indoors than we had planned to do (traveling with our baby daughter), and it felt like home. A nice and friendly neighbourhood and lovely host. The apartment had everything we needed, and we would be happy to stay there again if we come back to the city (which we hope to do).[QWERTY123]Wir können uns nur positiv zu dem Appartement in Harlem äußern, alles hat hervorragend geklappt, die Lage ist sehr gut, zur nächste Subway sind es wenige Minuten zu Fuß und der Central Park ist fußläufig zu erreichen. Wir haben 5 Tage in NY mit unseren großen Kindern verbracht. Das Appartement ist sehr schön groß und geräumig, so wie auf den Bildern dargestellt. Vielen lieben Dank an Robin, die schon während unseren Reisevorbereitungen im Vorfeld bei Fragen immer umgehend mit hilfreichen Antworten und Tipps weitergeholfen hat. Absolut zu Empfehlen. Ich war anfangs skeptisch in Harlem zu wohnen, ich kann aber nur bestätigen, es ist eine absolut ruhige und angenehme Gegend. Wir sind abends vom Essen immer zu Fuß zum Appartement gelaufen und haben uns nie unwohl gefühlt.[QWERTY123]Le logement est parfait avec tout le nécessaire. Les petits commerces à proximité ouverts 24h/24 sont bien pratiques après avoir arpenté les rues new yorkaises. Le metro  n'est qu'a quelques rues et sur, meme le soir tard. 
[QWERTY123]La casa es ideal per una gran família com és la nostra, Erem 8 persones. És clara i acollidora. Molt neta.
Tot i que pot semblar que està allunyada del centre, està molt ben comunicada. L'amfitriona, la  Robin, és molt acollidora, simpàtica i disposada a ajudar-nos en qualsevol qüestió.[QWERTY123]Super appartement, très lumineux, au calme, très propre, proche de tout commerce et des transports en commun. Bien équipé, comme sur les photos!!!!
Robin est une personne très accueillante parlant parfaitement le français, et peut mettre moyennant finance une navette pour l'A/R pour JFQ. 
[QWERTY123]My mother, sister, aunt, two cousins and I stayed here for 5 nights. The set-up was perfect for our group. The condo is huge! Having two washrooms available for 6 ladies was great. Robin and George were welcoming, helpful and quick to reply to any questions we had. Would definitely recommend this place for groups.[QWERTY123]We had a great time in the loft and would like to thank Robin and her family for making us feel very welcome. We can definitely recommend this location![QWERTY123]Het appartement is geweldig en smaakvol ingericht. Veel ruimte, goede bedden, grote ontbijttafel en een heerlijke lounge waar je 's avonds lekker onderuit kunt zakken.  We waren met zes vriendinnen en blij dat we vanuit alle drukte in Manhattan 's avonds naar deze plek konden terugkeren. Fijne buurt ook. We hebben ons er geen moment onveilig gevoeld. Supermarkt met groot assortiment en een 'fruitman' om de hoek. Robin is heel enthousiast, behulpzaam en gastvrij. We voelden ons er echt thuis.  Een echte aanrader!![QWERTY123]The place was terrific and Robin was super nice.  We were actually surprised that that apartment looked exactly as it did in the photos. It was HUGE and very comfortable and clean. The location was perfect as there were lots of interesting places to see in Harlem as well as some great restaurants. It was also very convenient to the subway system so we easily visited many areas in the city.[QWERTY123]Robin a ete tres accueillante et nous a donne toutes les informations necessaire pour notre sejour. L'appartement est grand et lumineux. Il convient peut-etre plus a une famille du fait que les chambres ne soient completement fermees jusqu' au plafond. Le quartier est typique et tres sympa et nous nous sentions en securite!
[QWERTY123]Robin was a wonderful host. Made us feel welcome and was super helpful with our many questions. Description actually doesn't do it justice. This place is huge for a NYC home! Layout worked well though if u have snorers in your group like we did, bring some earplugs. With such a big space the sound travels. Location was great for most of us. I like not being in the middle of the tourist craziness and it was a quick subway ride to Times Square. But we had 2 elderly folks with us who wanted to see the sights which meant subways were out so we made good use of Uber to get back and forth. The grocery store at the corner is amazing! Seriously, u don't need to shop before u get here. It has everything! I would highly recommend Robin and her home and will be back myself in the future :-)[QWERTY123]notre séjour s'est très bien passé; Robin qui parle français nous a bien accueillis . La proximité des commerces est idéale.L'utilisation du métro express4 et 5(à 125 street) permet de descendre rapidement au sud;[QWERTY123]Logement bien situé, proche du métro donc accès facile pour visiter NY.
Quartier calme et propre. Robin est très sympathique, du faite qu'elle parle le français, cela facilité la communication. Nous conseillons ce logement qui a un très bon rapport qualité prix.[QWERTY123]Great place to stay! Definitely recommend it! Robin was great and answered all my questions as this was my first time using Air Bnb![QWERTY123]Robins apartment is great and Robin is an amazing host.

The apt is situated on a great quiet road away from the hustle and bustle of the city and is very clean and tidy. We had four people there but it could comfortably sleep 8 (2 doubles, 2 twins). We had the whole place to ourselves and it was a great base for exploring Harlem but also had easy access to the subway which takes you to midtown and downtown really easily. Great location, easy to get to late at night by subway or taxi.

We ate out a lot but the apt is a great place to relax of you have a quite evening in and it has all the facilities for self catering (plus washing machine!) if you decide to do that. Great supermarket just round the corner too.

Robin was so helpful in the months before our trip - the family brought my mum to New York for her 70th birthday - helping answer all the questions we had in super quick time and recommending things to do. She also have us lots of useful info when we arrived and even found bars me and my brother could watch British soccer at at 7 am!

I hope to get another group together in future to visit NYC and stay at Robin's place again. Thanks! Euan[QWERTY123]Robin a réservé à notre groupe d'amis un accueil très chaleureux. Elle parle le français parfaitement et cela nous a été fort utile comme l'ont été ses conseils sur l'environnement du quartier et les commerces de proximité.
Le loft est particulièrement vaste et fonctionnel et nous nous y sentions très bien. Je recommande fortement...[QWERTY123]Robin a toujour répondu à nos mails rapidement, elle est très  sympathique et parle parfaitement le français.Nous avons passé une superbe semaine à 7 dont un enfant de 2 ans.[QWERTY123]Nous avons été très bien accueillis par le mari et la fille de Robin qui nous ont données toutes les informations dont nous avions besoin et ils ont répondus à toutes nos questions. Nous avons rencontré Robin qques jours après notre arrivée. Très charmante et agréablement sympathique. Les photos sont conformes à la réalité. Appartement spacieux, les cloisons ne vont pas jusqu'au plafond et des rideaux remplacent les portes. Le quartier est très agréable, calme et pratique. Supermarchés et métro prochent. Notre séjour a été très agréable.[QWERTY123]UBICATO TRA 2 LINEE DELLA METROPOLITANA IN ZONA RESIDENZIALE BEN CURATA
LA CASA SILENZIOSA E'ANCHE LUMINOSA E SPAZIOSA ,
RENDE IL SOGGIORNO ACCOGLIENTE E GRADEVOLE.
UNICO HANDICAP LA PRESENZA DI PANNELLI DIVISORI DEGLI AMBIENTI NOTTE CHE RENDONO LE 4 CAMERE DA LETTO NON COMPLETAMENTE ISOLATE ACUSTICAMENTE .
[QWERTY123]Robin's place was very spacious and comfortable. Subway transit was only a few blocks away.  There was a 24 hour grocery right around the corner which was great for late night snacks.  There were also several restaurants within walking distance.[QWERTY123]confortable, limpio y espacioso.
Robin estuvo atenta con nosotros desde los inicios, hasta que nos despedimos. 
Aunque alejado de Manhattan, hay un subway a 5 minutos. Muy tranquilo.
Ideal para familias con hijos.
[QWERTY123]SpaHa loft was exactly as described.   The space was enormous and was perfect for our family of 5.  Everyone had their own space.   The second full bathroom was great as it allowed us to have a separate bathroom for the kids which made everyone happier.

Market around corner had everything you needed.   Subway was only 5 minutes walk so we used it all the time to get around.   Took a number of Robin's suggestions for restaurants and they were all great. 

Robin was a great host and always responded immediately to any queries and was willing to help out anytime. 

I would recommend the loft to any large family or group traveling to New York.

Cheers[QWERTY123]Ottima casa, molto vicina alla metro e Robin molto gentile.[QWERTY123]Huge, sunny loft with room for two families. Robin is attentive and knowledgeable. All her recommendations were spot on. Easy to walk to subway to get all around the city. We'll stay here again![QWERTY123]Great spacious, light and comfortable apartment that is excellent value for money too. Robin lives upstairs and was easily contactable if needed. Felt safe in the apartment and public transport was within a 5 minute walk for buses into the city and the subway was a few minutes longer. I hadn't realised that the apartment was in such close proximity to Central Park which you could walk to an about 20 minutes -and a fantastic open space to explore. Would highly recommend Robin's SpaHa Loft. Thank you Robin.[QWERTY123]Bel appartement conforme en tous points au descriptif , beaux volumes, rue calme, à 4 blocs du métro (sans danger), superette en bas du logement ou vous pouvez trouver une nourriture variée et très correcte. Quartier familial ou l'on se sent en sécurité. Idéal pour famille nombreuse ou à plusieurs  familles. Un grand merci à Robin pour son accueil, sa sympathie et son sourire, ainsi que ses précieux conseils. Nous avons passer un très bon séjour dans votre appartement. Adresse à retenir !![QWERTY123]SpaHa Loft is a great place to stay. Our host, Robin, was so attentive to our needs and greeted us on arrival, made sure we had all we needed and gave us advice when we had questions on New York generally. The apartment is in Harlem but within walking distance of subways, a supermarket around the corner and a very convenient place to stay. The apartment was huge with great amenities, kitchen appliances and utensils, crockery, etc, cupboard spaces, laundry in the unit, ironing room set up. We had a group of five ladies staying and it was perfect for our needs. Definitely recommend this great apartment. Thanks Robin for being such a great host. 



[QWERTY123]Apartment is exactly as described, perfectly clean with a well equiped kitchen, Robin is always available and nice for any questions with her sunny smile and her nice american accent when she speaks a quite good french. She is very helpfull and patient. Merci encore Robin pour votre gentillesse ![QWERTY123]Wir hatten eine großartige Zeit in Robins Apartment. Die Räumlichkeiten sind wirklich riesig und noch weitläufiger als man nach den Fotos vermuten würde. Robin und ihre Familie waren äußerst freundliche, zuvorkommende und stets hilfsbereite Gastgeber. Der Weg zu den touristischen Spots war aufgrund der strategisch guten Lage gut mit der U-Bahn zu bewältigen. Harlem ist ein Bezirk mit gewissen sozialen Problemen, man kommt also, wenn man sich im öffentlichen Raum bewegt, unweigerlich auch mit Armut in Kontakt, alle Begegnungen, die wir hatten, waren jedoch freundlich und wir haben uns nie bedrängt gefühlt. Im Gegenteil haben wir das sehr lebhafte Spanish Harlem genossen und waren abends gerne noch zum Essen in einem der guten von Robin empfohlenen Restaurants. Wenn wieder ein New York-Urlaub ansteht, kommen wir gerne wieder![QWERTY123]Robin's SpaHa Loft was absolutely perfect for our large group of 9 people! The double door locked entrance made us feel safe and secure, and the elevator straight to our loft was perfect for those with luggage and after long days of walking all over NYC! The loft itself was beautiful with more than ample space! We had a total of 9 people staying in the loft that was able to accommodate us all comfortably. The loft came with everything we needed for our 4 night stay, including kitchen supplies, towels, toiletries, extra sheets and laundry units in the loft. Robin was very easy to get in touch with and even had a welcome binder with plenty of recommendation spots around the Loft. The Loft was only 3 short blocks (about a 2-3 minute walk) from the subway/metro station that we took every day to get to the different neighborhoods in NYC. We also took an Uber at times when we didn't want to take the metro and never had any issues. We can't wait to return to NYC for another vacation![QWERTY123]This location is a great deal for North Manhattan. The apartment is huge and located next to a fantastic grocery store. The sushi there is truly some of the best that we have tasted. There is not much privacy in the apartment - no floor to ceiling walls and no doors on bedrooms. Also, not the ritzier part of the city - a little gritty at times so be prepared.[QWERTY123]Huge apartment, great choice to stay in NY. A bit far from downtown, but not a problem because is near the subway. Robin is always eager to please and make a perfect accomodation. Thanks for all!!![QWERTY123]Huge and comfortable flat corresponding to the description . Robin was always ready to answer any of our questions and was very helpful.[QWERTY123]Appartement très grand, nous sommes venus à 8 avec grands-parents et enfants, tout le monde avait de la place, 2 salles de bains avec WC dedans. L'appartement est à 5 à 10 min à pieds du métro, on arrive très vite dans le centre de Manhattan ou Central parc, supermarché juste à côté, pharmacie et banques (distributeurs) également tout proche. L'appartement est climatisé. Robin est très accueillante et parle très bien le français. Il y a tout ce qu'il faut en linge, et il y a une machine à laver le linge avec lessive et sèche-linge. Et bien sûr machine à laver la vaisselles. Les locataires précédent avaient laissé sel, poivre, vinaigre, quelques conserves... Nous avons fait de même avec la nourriture acheté en trop .... pratique ;-) Ne pas hésiter à louer cet appartement !!!![QWERTY123]Cet appartement correspondait en tous points à nos attentes.Nous partions à deux familles(7personnes) et il est très spacieux. Il est même beaucoup plus grand que sur les (Website hidden by Airbnb) cuisine est très pratique et largement pourvue en vaisselle et ustensiles pour cuisiner. Nous y dinnions pratiquement tous les soirs.Robin laisse aussi un classeur avec toutes les choses à faire et les bonnes adresses du quartier.Le quartier est très agréable et typique certe loin des lieux à visiter mais le métro ligne 6 à côté dessert tout Manhattan.Robin même en vacances lors de notre passage a toujours été joignable et (Website hidden by Airbnb) recommande de demander à Robin d'organiser les transferts appartement/aéroport : nous désirions un seul véhicule pour nous 7 et Robin à fait appel à VTC qui nous attendait à l'aéroport.Chauffeur sympathique et véhicule très confortable. Bref nous n'avons que des points positifs. MERCI ROBIN.[QWERTY123]La casa es grande. Estuvimos 8 personas y todos muy cómodos. Robin vive arriba y no hay mas vecinos. El menaje es muy completo. Esta bien ubicada con el metro a 7 minutos. Robin es muy agradable. En general cumplió con nuestras expectativas.[QWERTY123]Robin offre un accueil très chaleureux et amical dès l'arrivée dans l'appartement, elle parle très bien français ce qui aide beaucoup ceux qui ne sont pas bilingues! L'appartement est conforme aux photos et descriptions données, bien situé, très spacieux, et bien équipé. Nous avions aussi réservé le taxi par l'intermédiaire de Robin, le chauffeur est très sympathique et ponctuel. 
Bref je recommande vivement ce logement où nous nous sentions comme chez nous. Il faut juste bien noter qu'il n'y a pas de cloisons jusqu'au plafond pour ne pas être surpris en arrivant.[QWERTY123]Great apartment with lots of space. Was nice to come back to after a hectic day out. Amenities are all close including subway and supermarket. We had an evening out in Harlem too. Robin was a great host and left us to our own devices once keys handed over with plenty of information passed on to make the stay even better.[QWERTY123]Alojamiento perfecto para alojarse en NY sin estar en el mismo centro. Bien comunicado y espacioso. Es exactamente lo que ofrecía por la web. Totalmente recomendable.[QWERTY123]Loft très grand et bien équipé . Bien placé à proximité du métro. L’appartement est très calme ce qui n’est pas négligeable dans une ville comme New York ! 
Nous avons passé une très belle semaine à 2 familles de 4 personnes[QWERTY123]Robin was a fantastic host and any problem was soon sorted. The area was a little intimidating for us 5 women , although did not feel threatened at any time.  The apartment is well equipped and comfortable.[QWERTY123]La casa di Robin è straordinaria: grandissima, accogliente, pulita, arredata con gusto, attrezzata di tutte le necessità e gli spazi (ampissimi!!!). Lei è gentile e simpatica, ti aiuta in tutto. Davvero, quasi mi dispiaceva uscire tanto stavo bene in quella splendida casa... ve la consiglio! Noi eravamo in 5 ma va bene anche per un gruppo più numeroso, direi fino a 8 persone ci si sta comodi. Anche come ubicazione non è scomoda con la subway fermate (Phone number hidden by Airbnb) arriva in poche fermate alla fifth avenue. Un alloggio strepitoso e molto newyorkese.[QWERTY123]Robin and George are exceptional hosts! The loft was perfect for our needs -- there were 6 of us and we had space to all be together and to be alone. The second bathroom was invaluable on busy mornings. We had everything we needed -- a complete kitchen and laundry and an elevator! This place is sparkling clean and well laid out -- it's a great value and I would highly recommend it.[QWERTY123]Se trata de un apartamento enorme tipo loft, lo que significa que las habitaciones no están completamente cerradas. Aun así nosotros hemos ido en familia 8 personas y hemos estado fenomenal. Es espacioso, limpio y tiene todo lo necesario para tener una estancia fantástica. Las camas son muy cómodas y eso siempre se agradece. AdemásRobin fue encantadora en todo momento, desde la llegada hasta el final y nos dio todo tipo de consejos y recomendaciones. Gracias por todo! :)[QWERTY123]Robin and her husband were wonderful hosts and greeted us at the door when we arrived from LaGuardia. The apartment was fantastic and even larger than it looks in the photos. 2200 square feet! It was nicely decorated and we had everything we needed. The location is great and we mostly used Uber (because we had four people traveling together) to get to Midtown, which was about $25 each time. There is a subway stop nearby too. The bedrooms have walls but no ceilings, so if you have early risers and late sleepers staying together, it would be best to put the early risers in the front bedroom near the kitchen to provide quiet for the others in the back bedrooms. Also, the bedrooms have curtains instead of doors, so you need to be aware for the sake of privacy. This place is an incredible value and really comfortable, compared to the cramped hotel rooms in NYC. Thanks![QWERTY123]nous avons aimé cet appartement spacieux et confortable,bien équipé,proche du métro et des commerces,cela nous a permis de découvrir New-York dans de bonnes conditions;et nous remercions Robin pour son accueil,son aide et son sourire ![QWERTY123]Het appartement heeft onze verwachtingen meer dan overtroffen ! 
Het is netjes, gezellig, zeer compleet uitgerust en vooral heel erg 
ruim van opzet.
De diverse kamers staan weliswaar in open verbinding met elkaar maar door de ruime indeling is er toch voldoende privacy.
Robin is een geweldige vrouw:gastvrij, behulpzaam, attent en aanwezig wanneer het nodig is. 
De ligging geeft een eerlijk en betrouwbaar beeld van hoe de mensen in Amerika werkelijk leven.
Kortom : een aanrader met een zeer goede prijs-kwaliteit verhouding.[QWERTY123]Robins place in East Harlem is great value. It can easily take 8 people. Its an easy flat  walk to the Metro of about 5 minutes. Its only 15-20 minutes to all the attractions of downtown NY. The area does initially look a little run down, but we had zero problems and enjoyed the local restaurants and shops. The super market around the corner is excellent, as is the local bottle shop. Robin is a delightful host. I thoroughly recommend Robins place.[QWERTY123]Had a great experience. Quick response time, clean,  spacious, short distance to subway, affordable parking lot near by. Would definitely recommend![QWERTY123]Convenient location. Lots of space. Friendly host. Good base for exploring NY for a group.[QWERTY123]L'appartamento è molto grande e arredato con gusto, non manca nulla. Robin parla italiano ed è molto disponibile.[QWERTY123]Vous serez accueilli par un magnifique sourire. 
Logement pratique et fonctionnel. Tout est à proximité. 
Robin  est d'une gentillesse et vous mets à l'aise. 
Pour une première fois à N.Y j'ai été agréablement surprise. 
Hate de pouvoir y revenir[QWERTY123]Bel appartement pour 8 personnes avec 4 chambres séparées, 2 sdb, cuisine équipée, lave-linge, sèche-linge, ascenseur, dans un quartier assez calme avec toutes les commodités à proximité : métro bus supermarché et petits resto à 5mn. Petit plus, notre hôte a organisé pour nous le transport en voiture privée aéroport appartement , pratique quand on est nombreux. Je recommande[QWERTY123]The house is  very nice, comfortable, well equipped and close to metro stations and supermarkets. The multilingual and multicultural neighborhood is fascinating, and deserves to be visited more closely. Robin was very friendly and helpful too.[QWERTY123]Le logement est calme, lumineux et très spacieux !
Nous étions une famille avec 3 ado et un bébé et le quartier est sans problèmes.
Robin nous a accueilli en personne et avait organisé pour nous le transfert de l'aéroport !
Parfait, je le recommande vivement....[QWERTY123]Thank you Robin . We had a very good Time.[QWERTY123]Robin is the perfect host. we really enjoyed our stay at the spaha loft. great location, good communication, outstanding facilities, spacious rooms, good airco, nice harlem neighborhood, nearby subway and stores,  ... our stay could not have been better. perfect for a group of 8 . I would recommend this place to anyone who will visit NYC.[QWERTY123]L'appartement est identique à l'annonce et aux photos. La chambre dans le séjour (dans le cube marron) est la plus bruyante de toutes car elle donne sur la rue, les autres sont au top. Notre hôte était totalement disponible et a su répondre à nos questions et résoudre nos problèmes très rapidement. Nous avons séjourné à 7 adultes sans aucun problème. Le quartier est déroutant mais tout à fait sécure à Harlem. Robin avait organisé pour nous les transport aller/retour à l'aéroport, notre chauffeur, Luis, était génial et totalement disponible. Je conseille vivement.[QWERTY123]Robin is hands down the best Airbnb host we have ever had. Without a doubt. There is nothing more to say![QWERTY123]Great place, nice vibe. In an interesting part of town. Really get the local vibe and great NY experience.[QWERTY123]Robins apartment is huge and very comfortable. We are a family of six with our youngest being 4 years old. The space was so good for her after full days of exploring nyc. The beds are very comfortable. Two bathrooms was also a huge advantage. The kitchen is well stocked with some basics like salt, pepper and olive oil in the cupboard. There are two markets just around the corner that have everything. The subway is just a few blocks away and you can take the green 4 or 5 express to Grand Central station.. it was all very easy to navigate. We did have a day off the subway and used Uber as the subway at 125th is a bit confronting if you’re not used to Harlem. The trains are full, people are generally friendly but there was a few incidents when we felt a little unsafe. An Uber is about $25 and takes up to 40 mins from downtown depending on time of day. If you have a car there is street parking, just don’t park in front of a fire hydrant!  Robin and her husband, George are the loveliest people and just live upstairs."	40.801642496421955	-73.93922139409575	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/16974	8	225.0	0.9
19	16990	"I had a really nice staying in cozy suite! the place is clean, the staff is helpfull, it's a bit far away from the city, but it's worth it! you can't find a place as good as this if you want to get closer to the city, at least not at this price!
Loved it![QWERTY123]This is quite a clean and comfortable place, although guests not familiar with NY should know that it is a long way out, and it is a  9 or 10 block walk to the subway. The price reflects this. Make sure you have a charged cell phone with you to contact the host, or you will have trouble getting in. They don't hear knocks on the door and aren't always at home. Finally, the $200 security deposit (cash only) and the $10 service fee are real irritants. They should scrap them.[QWERTY123]i love it
nice plaece
nicht alles da was man so braucht aber es macht nichts wenn man die eigentümerin fragt
lg pano[QWERTY123]The place is clean and very neat ... It has TV, kitchen, and nice bathroom. I thought the house is far from subway station but it only took me 10 minutes to walk there 
neighbor area is kind of scary and late night ... but i guess some area in manhattan is same as well. 
place is cozy so if someone is looking for relax and quiet place.. it's good for that[QWERTY123]Me and my girlfriend staying 1 week in the place, and we love the place, is very clean and comfortable, Thays is very friendly and nice.

I recommend."	40.68493229454699	-73.9316610388113	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/16990	2	59.0	0.85
20	17092	"Ralph was very hospitable and the place is just as shown. Hell's Kitchen was a cool experience. Thanks![QWERTY123]Location: It's conveniently located in on 51st in Hell's Kitchen/Midtown, so so it's close to all the action which is great. Be warned, it's 4 story walk up so you could be getting your exercise. Amish Market is nearby for groceries. 

Room: Is just as pictured, or perhaps better. Clean sheets and towels, soap, WiFi, etc. were all provided similar to a hotel.  The kitchen, dining and bathroom are pretty small (it's NYC after all!), though this shouldn't be a problem if you don't require a ton of space.

Host: Ralph was not in town when I stayed here, but he really made sure I had everything I needed to feel comfortable and took steps to remedy any issues. His partner was available in person for check in/out and responsive at all times if I had any concerns (like ""How does this shower work?"" or ""How do I get to LaGuardia?"").[QWERTY123]Bottom line - this is indeed a cool room.

Monica was waiting for me as soon as I arrived, without too much prior coordination, and explained to me the basic stuff.
The room was clean, the bed was very big and comfortable, the working desk was great for my laptop.
I didn't notice that the room was on a 3rd floor with no elevator, so this was quite a surprise, but nevertheless not much of an issue.
The wifi connection could have been faster/better, but the other flatmate had no complains.

The area is great for both accessing all areas of Manhattan and for local nightlife (although a bit too many gay clubs...).

I didn't use the kitchen, but it's completely usable.
The bathroom door doesn't close too well.

I might book it again :)[QWERTY123]I really enjoyed the stay in Hell's Kitchen.  Monica greeted me when I arrived and acclimted me to the apartment!!  The decription matched the actual experience and it's a great location.  Thanks![QWERTY123]Ralph was an excellent host. He was unavailable personally, but Monica met me exactly as planned and was very friendly. The room was very nice and comfortable.[QWERTY123]Ralph's apartment was close to all the things that make NYC great.    Theatre district, garment center and the Empire State,building all very close.   The apartment as whole was very clean , nice bathroom , workable kitchen and dining area. Although I didn't meet Ralph himself as he was out of town Lester in the building. The bedroom had a queen bed with plenty of closet and drawer space. I was impressed wit the flatscreen tv with dvr.  Nice touch.   Only hiccup, was I felt my bedding wasn't clean.  I addressed that with the host and took care of it[QWERTY123]Stayed the summer at Ralphs while working long hours at a financial institution. My room was fairly basic and small but worked fine for my simple needs. There was a cleaning person who came by sporadically. Ralph was in Europe for most of the time but communication was pretty fluid. Good food and nightlife in the hood. Only downsides were that it's on 4th floor of a walkup and the neighbors were loud at times. Overall a good experience.[QWERTY123]Ralph was a very welcoming host from the very beginning and was always asking how my stay was to make sure everything was fine. His area of Hell's Kitchen has many great restaurants nearby and is very close to Times square which was convenient. His apartment is on the fourth floor of the apartment and there is not an elevator, so just prepare accordingly. Other than that I would definitely return if I come back to New York.[QWERTY123]Vivir en casa de Ralph ha sido una gran experiencia. Está estupendamente situada, cerca del metro, de Times Square y la zona de musicales de Broadway. Central Park está a unos minutos, y la zona de la Ópera y el Ballet también queda cerca. Sí queréis hacer deporte, el Hudson River Park está al lado.
Ralph ha sido un gran anfitrión. Se ha preocupado por que estuviese a gusto, habla perfectamente varios idiomas y tiene un inmejorable gusto musical.
La habitación es muy bonita y cómoda. Es amplia, la cama es muy cómoda y cuenta con todas las comodidades. La cocina es pequeña pero funcional, igual que el baño.
Repetiría sin dudarlo.[QWERTY123]Absolument rien a dire c'était parfait, merci encore a Enzo[QWERTY123]safe,clean,perfect!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!![QWERTY123]Great stay, great hosts.[QWERTY123]Agradezco a Monica (madre de Enzo) que fue quien me recibió y se ocupó durante mi estadía (a través de WA) de ver si estaba bien, si necesitaba algo, cómo lo estaba pasando. Más allá del departamento: muy bien; de la ubicación: excelente, ya que me permitió movilizarme caminando mayormente; destaco el nivel humano de Monica, quien el día de mi regreso se quedó conmigo en la puerta del edificio, para esperar el Shuttle. Lo recomiendo altamente.[QWERTY123]The host canceled this reservation 61 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.[QWERTY123]Stayed for couple weeks , I've been hosted by roommate. Was very nice and friendly! Location is great! Place very clean and safe. Very recommended[QWERTY123]Monica was super responsive and easy to communicate with![QWERTY123]You can expect the same as Enzo describes about his department you will no have any surprise.  The departmen is fine for the value and the location is excellent. But the most important is that Enzo makes you feel like your at home."	40.76341922524977	-73.98865412541802	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/17092	1	51.0	0.844444
21	17240	"Was verry nice to stay there. Brooklin is an upcoming area, and their home clean, and quite. Next trip to big apple we will book for sure.[QWERTY123]Staying here was probably the best choice that I have ever made going to NYC. The rooms and bathrooms are excellent. The service was friendly and professional. The internet was blazing fast, and I love the soul food restaurant located a few blocks away.

I suggest this place to anyone who is going to NYC and needs affordable accommodations. We will definitely be back.[QWERTY123]I had a wonderful time in Cozy Suite Inn. The place is so quite, bright and nice. I nearly felt at home, and the district is really cool,
with a good location, not too far from the subway that leads directly to manhattan in twenty minutes. I thank Greg and Thais for their welcoming. I did not even need to ask them for anything else than staying there.[QWERTY123]NA[QWERTY123]My daughter and I stayed 3 nights in the Citadelle. I agree with the others who stayed here--the place was clean, surprisingly quiet, and Thais was very nice. The neighborhood did worry us at first but turned out to be fine. It's quite a bargain. (Tho' I also would love to see a microwave put in, as someone suggested!) I'd recommend it.[QWERTY123]I just stayed at the Cozysuite inn and it was a good experience. I slept like a baby and the other travelers I met where nice and interesting. Thais was a good host and she was very attentive to my needs even helping me get a cab on my last day when i left to the airport. The apt is located i Brooklyn and its only a 8 min walk to the subway which takes you straight into Manhattan. So very convenient, overall i would recommend this place if you want to get a good feel for what it is to be a New Yorker.[QWERTY123]Separately-locked master bedroom in third-floor, 3-bedroom apartment with shared kitchen & living room.  Very clean room completely empty except for full-size bed--no closet, dresser, alarm clock, mirror, shelves, etc.  $15/night add-on taken out of deposit for private use of the attached bathroom is totally worth it considering the base rental price.  Also nice is the private (apartment-only) access to the roof where there are two patio chairs.  Living room has couch, TV, and wi-fi (ask for password).  There's also a folding card table and chairs, dishes and cookware.

Nice, well-shaded block seems fairly safe; however, 8-block walk to A-train stop at Utica got progressively worrisome as the weekend approached, but I never walked alone and nothing happened. Never saw a restaurant nearby; seemed to be only 24-hr convenient stores which also sold sandwiches, bagels, coffee, etc.

Because of the bargain price alone, I'd give it 5-stars, but was inconvenienced by host.  Confirmed at 3PM that I'd be landing at 5:30 and was told would be met ""after 6:30"".  I had to wait in 45-degree rain in Williamsburg til 9:30PM (there's no obvious safe place to hang out in host's neighborhood) so wasn't able to see planned concert.  Emailed multiple times weeks before that my departure flight was at 8PM and needed confirm arrival time of next guest so that I wouldn't be lugging bags around after noon check-out.  Was told $20 for additional 12 hours, but received text message at 1:30am the night before check-out saying I needed to be out of room by 11:45am, then was charged same amount as if I had use of the room just to leave my bags unattended in living room where I was ""welcome to stay for late check-out"".  However, the 2 guests sharing the twin bedroom had taken the cushions off the couch, brought out the table and completely took over the living room.  In person, host was very sweet, even offering to arrange car to airport, but no apologies or concession for inconveniences.

Still would highly recommend with the caveat to adjust plans to get into Manhattan as it is a bit off the path (40-45min to the Guggenheim, for example) and to keep in constant contact with host.[QWERTY123]The room was ok, really basic.  Didn't see any bugs although we had been told by the previous people (who we got to meet) that they had seen a few... We were there for 3 days during a heat wave and a fan would have been helpful.  Difficult to get air in the room.  I had the room at the back (BTW, the ONLY one with a double bed!).  Felt a little guilty because there was a couple in the room next to me in what the owners call a double bed but is definitely more like a single bed.  2 rooms out of 3 have a single bed (hard for a couple when it's sooo hot outside).  The kitchen is quite unappealing with drawers falling half out... no urge to cook there!  Living room bare and lacking table, no desire to spend time in it. The room in the front (where my friend was staying) was very loud.  All night long, people drove with their music blasting. She NEVER slept! Also important to say that we NEVER in our 3 days there, saw another white person.  Felt scared although nothing happened BUT we were 2 girls and I WOULD NOT return there alone.  Other parts of Brooklyn feel MUCH safer.  This is definitely no hypster place!  The owner seemed nice, we only saw her once.[QWERTY123]Basic, clean, well situated, good welcome - a good place to stay if you need somewhere to crash in New York for a day or 2 ![QWERTY123]we stayed 8 nights in cozysuite inn citadelle. the whole apartment is really clean and neat. during our stay there was a big heat over ny. which is bad as there is no air con in the apartment. but thais helped out with some fans! she's friendly! we experienced the neighborhood in bedford without any difficulties. some groceries around. j-train, a- and c-train  nearby. also busses to metro. summing up, it's a real bargain! although quite a ride to manhattan. i can recommend this place! ah, when you're two people, take only the citadelle as there is the only bed fitting two comfortably.[QWERTY123]The house was fine, and the room clean and big enough for two. The only problem was that it was a bit far from the station and to come back at nights sometimes scaring because of the area, but during the day no problem at all.[QWERTY123]Cozysuite was everything that it was advertised to be - clean, comfortable, and an extraordinary bargain.  Yes, it was hot...but it was summer in NY...most homes in NY do not have air conditioning.  For those of you who are concerned, bring your own fan as I did (note: I didn't actually need it).  The accommodatians are a little far out, but still accessible by subway. Thais was very responsive and is willing to help make your stay a good one![QWERTY123]We did not enjoy our stay very much but understand that $39/night for a place to stay in NY is rare. Nonetheless Cozysuite is making enough money from its guests to provide a decent sanitary couch and fix the 
broken drawer in the kitchen and keep the rooms a bit more decent.  Even more my husband and I woke up with mysterious bites on our arms and hands.  We've experienced bed bugs before and a sure sign are tiny mysterious droplets of blood on the sheet. Well we saw two of those... I'm just stating the facts here. 

I also personally did not like the unsure feeling from only being able to text the owners before arriving and not speaking to them and hgiving a $200 cash deposit without an offer of a receipt. Once I asked for a receipt I did receive one by e-mail the next day. No one wants to pay someone cash without a paper trail...

The building is in the Bedford Stuyvesant area of Brooklyn. This isn't the best part of Brooklyn but it was safe. We walked the streets from the subway after 2 am and were fine.


[QWERTY123]Hi,every thing was perfect, I would recomend the cozysuite.
Manuel[QWERTY123]If you're looking for somewhere clean, simple, and most i importantly cheap, this is the place for you. 
This is not a home stay - each person is also a visitor so you are not imposing on anybody's patch but by the same token it lacks the comforts of a home.[QWERTY123]Great hosts and place[QWERTY123]Everything was ok, it is clean, cheap, and the area is safe. I can recommend. Slavek
[QWERTY123]we enjoyed our stay. thank you!![QWERTY123]As always this was a great place to stay clean, quiet, and warm in the winter. Thank you for your great hospitality.[QWERTY123]When we arrived to NYC from Colombia with our 20 month old baby it was very 
difficult to contact Thais. We had to stay in the airport two hours until i 
finally was able to get a hold of her when i told her we were going to head 
to her apartment to check in she stated we had to pay an additional $30.00 
fee for an early check in which she never mentioned before. The apartment 
was in really bad shape, locks did not work, toilet did not flush properly, 
mildew on the shower curtain and extensive water damage on walls and 
ceilings. On top of everything the apartment was really filthy and terribly 
cold. We also noticed bugs on both wood floors and on the bed. We asked our 
host for a broom and a mop so we can clean the place and not have our baby 
girl in those conditions she replied she would loan us the utensils to 
clean but never did. Also in our 2nd night at her place she had an issue 
with us leaving a sealed loaf of bread, and bananas. After all this she 
knocked at our door telling us we could not have our 20 month old baby 
running in the apartment as it was bothering other guests. Overall I would 
not whatsoever recommend this place to anyone. It is just not worth saving 
a few bucks. The area is also very sketchy and we did not feel safe at all 
walking after 5pm. We ended up leaving in our 3rd day there due to the 
condition of the place and the constant complaints by our host.[QWERTY123]The welcome was not very warm, very minimalist.
Housing is far from the center of Manathan (about 1h / 1h30 by train by the express) which is very inconvenient if you want to stand out in the evening after a day of visit.
The room was clean (according to photos ), but without any storage convenience (only a portico with a few hangers ). We did not have the requested twin bed (inability to control this option online, and there, they no longer accept payment ), ventilation in the bathroom did not work,light hallways , kitchen/dining room did not work several times (at our request, only a part of the light bulbs was changed). The TV worked the first few days, then no more remote control batteries that have not been changed, despite our claim.
The entrance doesn't look like the pictures, it is very cluttered with personal belongings of host.
Please note this is not at all a bed & breakfast ! The only convenience provided are towels and sheets. In the kitchen, few utensils, no dish soap (Sheila eventually give us one). In the bathroom, only 1 roll of toilet paper and a half for 2 weeks for 2 people (this was also visibly us to buy it).
At the end of our stay we wanted to enjoy the late -checking option to $20 as listed in the description, as our flight was Sunday at 21h. I told the host before arriving and they had replied that they were not able to give us at this time. It actually turned out that they no longer offered the option at all for several months! The morning of the day before departure note, she was ready to give it to us for $30. At night, she could finally not because absent the day of our departure. So we had to pack our bags on Saturday evening (very nice last night in New York) and leave for the airport on Sunday morning at 9am to leave our baggages, then return on Manathan to spend the day, and return to the airport in the evening.
To note, there is absolutely nothing to do in the neighborhood, but it's a pretty safe, at no time we felt unsafe.
ITo sum up, minimum service even non-existent, a place I would not recommend."	40.6851121109519	-73.93239571127692	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/17240	2	69.0	0.671429

Great double story space for the 6-8ppl in our group, plenty of bedding & Nicolas & Chris were very helpful when we needed a few more blankets. 5min walk to the subway & 20mins to manhattan on the A-train. Easy & quick access to JFK & La Guardia. After staying in Manhattan our past couple of visits it was great to experience Brooklyn. We'll be back!![QWERTY123]Place was fine, but quite dirty. We had to clean it ourselves. Neighbors upstairs are very noisy. Chair in the living room is totally dirty that we needed to cover it with something before sitting.

Nevertheless, host's assistant is ready whenever needed. And the availability of place is highly reliable. It's not a scam.[QWERTY123]The department is nice, only problem it has is that it really doesnt have 3 bedrooms: one bd is inthe living room, one bedroom (very big and nice) in the basement and to go to that room you have to go through another room, so you should have that in account. Chris and and Nicolas are very helpful people, always available.[QWERTY123]Nicholas and his assistant Chris are a very kind person. Concacts with both of them were fast and easy. The apartment is nice even though the basement has no windows. But we were provided with air conditionated and fens. It is 10 minutes far from two subway stations.
The apartment is good for people who uses it for travelling and holidays and stays not much in it. The price is really the best I could find in NYC. As you usually take 30/40 minutes to Manhattan it is not much convenient to come back home more than once a day.
Thank you Nicholas. We enjoyed our stay in NYC. Hope to meet you... next time![QWERTY123]Nicolas was very responsive and accommodating for our group. Great host.[QWERTY123]Nous avons loué cet appartement pendant 1semaine au jour de l'an 2012. L'appartement était très agréable et peut parfaitement contenir un grand groupe, bien que l'agencement des pièces manque cruellement d'intimité ( nous étions deux couples + deux amis). C'est cependant le seul bémol que nous pouvons trouver à cet appartement, très bien équipé, très proche de la station de métro (qui dessert très bien Manhattan). Nicolas et Chris, son assistant, ont été très présents pour nous depuis le jour de notre réservation. En bref notre séjour à New York a été très agréable et nous conseillons vivement cet appartement à d'autres.[QWERTY123]Overall, a very nice stay!  The host had great communication and Chris was always available when any problem arose.[QWERTY123]Really nice place ! Pretty and comfortable.[QWERTY123]We(4 people) had a great stay in Bed-Stuy.

The apartment was clean and everything were in order.

Chris is always there to help, and when the hot-water tank suddenly broke, a new one was in place and installed the same evening. 

Best recommendations.[QWERTY123]Everything was fast, no inconveniences. Just as advertised, everything went smoothly. Nice experience, just what we wanted.[QWERTY123]Host had good, prompt communication. Assistant was there to help quickly when we needed it. 

Place is large and can sleep a lot of people. A good value if you're travelling with a group.[QWERTY123]We had a wonderful week in Nicolas's flat!! It is quite big, very nice, and not so far from downtown New York!

Chris, his assistant, is very nice and waited for us the first night we arrived even if we were late!!

I recommend this flat!

Alex[QWERTY123]Chris is a nice person but unfortunately during our stay  we had a mice problem in the apartment. They told us that this was a normal issue in NY. They gave us two options: to stay or to leave.  However, we did not feel comfortable and did not want to stay there anymore. In the end we left  and they gave us back part of the money for the remaining nights. This was a pain in the ass because we missed an entire day looking and moving to another place. I Personally think that they should have gave us a full refund because we had to spend so much money in this process and this wasn't our fault. 
[QWERTY123]appartement relativement bien situé, mais à plus de 30 minutes de Manhattan. on peut loger à 10 max, et la prestation est au minimum.
(ménage, propreté,mobilier,vaisselle.....)
il n'y a qu'une vraie chambre l'autre est dans la cuisine salle à manger.
Dortoir au sous sol dans un état limite.
chauffage defaillant impossible à régler
cour extérieur type squat
sinon l’assistant CHRIS est super sympa.
[QWERTY123]Great place for eleven people. Nice neighborhood, 30 minutes away from nyc though.[QWERTY123]Nicolas was quick in answering my request for booking the location. 
He addressed my concerns regarding the past negative reviews. Then I made my first, hopefully of many, Airbnb booking. The unit was very spacious with clean sheets, towels and very good water pressure. We were 3 adults staying there for 1 week. We had more than enough room to socialize or to have alone time. The location is a short stroll to restaurants and shops. The subway station is a 5 min walk away. 
I had a great time exploring Brooklyn and Manhattan. I will check Airbnb first after booking my next holiday.[QWERTY123]Great location, apartment and hospitality ![QWERTY123]Great place to be and great host![QWERTY123]Nicolas was a great host, from the initial contact to the end of our stay. He even had extra keys ready for our group. His assistant Chris was also great to deal with, and together they made the logistics easy and hassle-free.  We were 11 people in this unit, and being two floors, it worked out well regarding living space and sleeping space. Other than some minor cosmetics, this apt is clean, in good shape, and the location is fantastic - the neighborhood is really great with friendly corner stores. There is a great little grocery store with lots of fresh produce, a deli, hot meals and a juice bar, about a 3 minute walk away. Peaches restaurant is also just a short walk to the corner and the food is great. The apt also easy access to the Metro etc. For a big group like we had, this place was fantastic, and we will definitely be contacting Nicolas again when we return to NYC. Thanks Nicolas & Chris![QWERTY123]I really love this neighborhood and Nicolas' house is very close to the subway. Great and big house, clean sheets, good shower, very cozy. Nicolas and Chris, his assistant, were both very kind and fast to answer. We had a wonderful stay![QWERTY123]Alt var i orden da vi ankom, ældre lejlighed men rent. 7 minutters gang til metro. Vi gik ikke alene ude om aftenen. Vi fik vores depositum retur som aftalt. Vi fik lov at blive i lejligheden nogle ekstra timer på grund af aften fly.[QWERTY123]Nicolas and his assistant Chris were very helpful, friendly and responded very quickly to emails.

The apartment is ideal for four or more people and has everything you need.

It is in an interesting area that may not be to everyone's liking, but we liked it.

My only small complaint would be that the apartment might have been a little bit cleaner in a few places.

That aside, more than satisfied[QWERTY123]Meillä oli mitä mahtavin viikko New Yorkissa!
 Nicolaksen asunnossa meitä oli  12 henkilöä joten viisi ensimmäistä yötä ja yksi kylpyhuone oli haaste. Tuntuu todella luksukselta viettää kaksi viimeistään yötä talon ylimmissä kerroksissa joissa meillä oli kaksi kylpyhuonetta ja keittiötä. Yläkerran asunnot olivat valoisampia ja kodikkaampia.
Chris oli ystävällinen ja ja avulias. Pidimme Bedford Stuyvesantista alueena.[QWERTY123]This space was convenient for my party of 12. With 5 full size beds, 1 twin, & a couch we were able to sleep everyone comfortably. The kitchen was stocked well with plates, bowls, cups and utensils for everyone, and we were able to prepare simple meals like eggs, rice and spam, and instant ramen noodles.  WiFi worked well, we were able to stream Netflix. The apartment is only a 10 minute leisurely walk to the A/C trains that will take you to Manhattan. Our party was mostly women so our mornings were a bit long trying to get everyone to shower in the single bathroom. My only qualms with this apartment was the stiffness and unevenness of the mattress I slept on. I can't speak for all the beds, but the full size bed directly in front of the bottom of the stairs was a little hard on my back. Other than that, my family and I really enjoyed our stay here and would recommend it for other larger parties![QWERTY123]Everyone liked the apartment. It had everything that is essential to pass a few day in the city. Chris, the assistant, was very helpful and kind.

We also had privacy and liberty, because there was no curfew. It has a good location, next to the subway, a cheap market and a lot of stuffs. I would recommend the apartment for some else that is looking for.[QWERTY123]When we arrived Nicholas's assistant (Chris) was very welcoming. The apartment was perfect for myself and 9 others. I really wish we had stayed longer. The host was great in responding quickly to our questions before we arrived. I would recommend this apartment and host.[QWERTY123]Nicolas is very responsive and he was able to help me get an additional apartment on very short notice. His apartments are a great size and conveniently located. One change I would make would be to have a common area/living room instead of so many beds, but other than that it is a great place.[QWERTY123]Nicolas' appartment is really well located (near the express subway to Manhattan and a food store). It is great for a large group, even if there is a little lack of privacy (only one real chamber). Also, the appartment wasn't very clean (we saw a few bugs..), and there was a chemical smell at our arrival.[QWERTY123]We had a great time in the appartment of Nicolas. The house for us was spacy and practical and a great base for visiting New York. We liked the neighbourhood as well with a great Italian restaurant around thecorner (Saranghina i believe the name was) Chris, special thanks for always being available and of help for us. Nicolas, appreciated your swift responses and we will certainly come back to you if we get the chance, Hans and family[QWERTY123]Tivemos uma excelente estadia, nos sentimos em casa. O assistente do anfitrião foi sempre muito atencioso e estava disponível para nos ajudar a qualquer hora que precisamos. O bairro é super tranquilo e o apartamento é bem localizado próximo a duas estações de metro.[QWERTY123]This place was amazing! Very spacious, and bigger than what it looks like in the pictures. A quick 35 minute subway trip to midtown Manhattan, and some really great places to eat nearby in BK. Would definitely stay here again.[QWERTY123]Our stay at Nicolás' brownstone was more than successful. Chris, his assistant, was more than willing to help us with everything we needed. The neighborhood was very beautiful and we were just a few blocks away from the Utica Av metro station. We felt safe at all times and were able to do our grocery shopping near the house. The apartment is beautiful, the kitchen was great, the a/c worked perfectly, the bath tub was very nice and the beds were really comfortable. Overall, we had a great stay.[QWERTY123]I was extremely disappointed with this accommodation. The only advantage is to be 5 minutes from the Metro. The apartment was dirty. The sheets were dirty; we washed them (Nicolas reimbursed us cleaning). Housekeeping had not been done before our arrival. Il had cockroaches and other creepy creatures. There is a removable air conditioning in each room but it does an infernal noise; unfortunately you have to leave the switch because otherwise he would very hot. The piece in the basement is extremely wet. There is a dehumidifier but it must empty the bin every two hours. This is a housing for 12 people; we were ten but the dining table is only for eight. No privacy. For $ 2,000 the week we hoped better.[QWERTY123]I thank the good Nicolas hosted by the House was fantastic and a good place
[QWERTY123]The host canceled this reservation the day before arrival. This is an automated posting.[QWERTY123]Nous sommes 4 (1 couple et 2 femmes seules) à avoir occupé cet appartement durant 8 jours. Il est agréable et vaste pour 4 personnes à condition de bien se connaître car un lit se trouve dans la salle à manger et un autre dans le passage qui conduit au sous-sol où se trouvent 3 autres lits et un canapé-lit. Il conviendrait bien à une famille avec enfants. Il est situé dans un quartier sympathique et calme à 10 mn d'une station de métro. Après une journée entière à arpenter New York nous avons apprécié ce quartier à l'architecture typique. A proximité on peut faire quelques achats alimentaires de base et manger dans un restaurant de tapas ou une pizzeria d'excellente qualité. Le métro met 20 à 50 minutes pour se rendre à Manhattan selon les quartiers. Le propriétaire Nicolas était absent mais nous avons pu le joindre facilement par téléphone et par mail. Son assistant Chris, qui habite au dessus, a également fait le nécessaire pour nous accueillir et répondre à nos demandes.[QWERTY123]We had a very nice stay in Nicolas's house. Everything was correct. The house was clean and it's a very comfortable place. It's very close to the metro station so we were in Manhattan in 30 minutes. We definitely recommend it.[QWERTY123]ok[QWERTY123]We were a group of 12 young people and we really liked our stay. It didn't bothered us because it was not so expensive but it is clearly not an apartment for more than 10 people: there was not enough place around the table, it was a bit complicated in the morning to have only one bathroom (with the toilets inside) and there was no window in the basement (with most of the beds) nor in the bedroom. 
However, the apartment has several good points: it was very easy to communicate with Chris, the host's assistant (we could check in and out at the hour we wanted), the inner courtyard was really pleasant, and, most of all, it was really well located (really close to the subway, many nice restaurants and shops).[QWERTY123]Nicolas was a great host and his communication was great and helped make our stay wonderful 

The Appartment is great and sleeps lots of people and is in a great area with brilliant a couple of brilliant restaurants two minutes away. 
[QWERTY123]Chris, de assistent was behulpzaam en aardig. Het appartement was groot genoeg voor 5 personen en de buurt is leuk, vlakbij metrostation Utica Av. Keuken simpel maar prima en badkamer hetzelfde.[QWERTY123]We were a group of 8 students. 

The accommodation was perfect size for the 8 of us. We had no problems at all. Good location, not far from city. The assistant was very helpful.
Back garden, also very nice. 
Would recommend.[QWERTY123]persona gentile, affidabile e precisa.[QWERTY123]Not a bad location, short walk to subway and about 30min commute into the main touristy area.
Plenty of room, and found it reasonably quiet.
Good value for money.
Only negative: MICE/RATS! The kitchen/1st bedroom area comes alive at night with squeals from rodents and them rustling around the kitchen. Also came one night to a dead mouse in the kitchen. 
I didnt mind too much but it was hard to sleep with all the noise and sometimes it did smell of rodents. I would suggest getting in a exterminator.[QWERTY123]Vi var rigtig glade for opholdet. Chris er housekeeper og det fungerede godt. Han boede ovenfor os. Lejligheden er kæmpestor og hyggelig - men ret nedslidt. Jeg vil ikke anbefale mere en 6 pga. eet toilet og meget få ting i køkkenet. Huset er meget charmerede og ligger dejligt lige overfor en pæn og stor skole. Utica stationen er tæt på og dermed nem adgang til Manhatten og der er mange skønne restaurater i området. Inden for et par hundrede meter er der både lækker morgenmadscafe og hyggelig restaurant og supermarked.  Området er på ""vej op"" men stadig måske ikke det bedste og tryggeste om natten. Men om dagen super :-)[QWERTY123]The location very good.Good conversation with Nicolas and Chris.
The house is big and tidy.[QWERTY123]Big apparment for many people but freezing cold in the wintertime. Great location 2 minutes to the subway. Don’t miss the restaurant Peaches which is just around the corner.[QWERTY123]Amazing communication, easy check in/out, nice ammenities.[QWERTY123]We stayed for a month at the apartment. The location was very close to the Subway station (Utica), Laundromat and a supermarket. The communication was good and they were very helpful.[QWERTY123]Espacioso y acogedor por su patio. A 10 min caminando de la estación útica.[QWERTY123]This brownstone in Bed-Stuy is in a great location in Brooklyn...close to restaurants, grocery stores and transit (A/C subway within 10 min walk). Overall, we enjoyed our stay and it's a decent value. However, in comparison to other Airbnb listings I've stayed, this was the most ""bare bones"" for amenities. I sent a private message to Nicolas as to recommendations of things we were missing from our stay, in hopes to make the listing even better for the future.[QWERTY123]UN BASEMENT LIMPIO ACOGEDOR Y ESTA MUY CERCA DEL TREN, RECOMENDADO.[QWERTY123]Nicolas's place was clean garden apartment, with a large basement room I didn't end up using at all.  The place was clean, Nicolas and Chris were responsive and helpful, and I like the Bed-Stuy location.[QWERTY123]Nice place. Good location."	40.68134004994295	-73.93636742120849	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/17297	12	180.0	0.875
23	5216	"I highly recomend this apartment!... Just arrived home now from NY and had a blast there. The apartment has the best location one can get. Just in the midle of everything. It's very confortable, quiet and cozy.
I'll be back for sure![QWERTY123]The apt. is in a perfect area, near everything. The building is very quite, the apt. it's good.[QWERTY123]Tonya was very nice over the phone and was very helpfull. Her place is very clean and very homie. Its very centralized and close to everything. Her superintendent wasn't to friendly thou. So if u need a central place that will give you a good nigjt sleep , her place is that place to be.[QWERTY123]Great place to rest and keep your belongings safe and secure. Tonya and her family are really friendly and very responsive. We had some trouble with her internet connection, but it didn't matter since there were plenty of free wi-fi cafes all around us. The superintendent did seem a bit up tight. However, I highly recommend this apartment!!![QWERTY123]The apartment was in a great area, and was super large as advertised. I had no problems with Tony or the super. I definitely recommend the place.[QWERTY123]I meant to write a review for my stay at Tonya's place a long time ago... hopefully, better late than never!!!

Tonya's place was clean, in a great location, and met all our needs and then some!  She was very courteous, responsive, and flexibile (me and my travel partner were late due to traffic, and she arranged for the property manager to meet us, even though it was 9pm).  My friend and I enjoyed our stay here and would definitely recommend this property and Tonya as a hostess anyday!  Thanks again Tonya![QWERTY123]Perfect Location!! The place was great, Tanya and Tony, were so nice and accommodating, would stay here again![QWERTY123]Great location, clean and functional.  Unfortunately we weren't able to get on the internet while we were there which was a bit disappointing but everything else was fine.  Great value for money, would probably stay there again![QWERTY123]the aparement is very well located - central manhattan and subway to everyehare near by. 
the apartment is basic - clean. a little different from the nice picture but gives valu for the money we payed. they can improve the cable TV channels - they currently have only very basic channels. not even the leading ones. 
the Supr - Winston is a great asset. very nice and helpfull.
[QWERTY123]Our stay was disappointing as we did not stay in the apt advertised.  Accomodations did not reflect the images posted on the site. No explanation was given as to why we were given an apt on the 2nd floor instead of the one on the fourth floor as per the itineary. Found the space to be somewhat dangerous (non child proof)with an open loft that had no railing as was seen in the pictures. My child was disappointed to have not been able to sleep upstairs for fear of rolling down to the first level.  Th bathroom was cramped with very little space to move around and an exposed hot pipe that ran from floor to ceiling that burnt my child when she went to take a shower.  Not an ideal place to stay with kid(s).  The street view does not represent the actual street (W 25th) where the apt was located.[QWERTY123]Nice apartment for two people to stay in NYC, maybe a little small for two couples. The lofted bedroom is quite short, but overall an extremely convenient apartment and convenient stay (super lives in the building so key hand-off, etc was easy).[QWERTY123]Our stay at Super Large APT was amazing! We booked the room one day in advance of our stay which can be a little nerve wrecking, but Tonya was great at responding. The check in was very easy and upon enterting the apt I found it to be quite charming - perfect for two people. There's a balcony which we didnt really use, but a 'nice to have' in case you want to chill in between sightseeing! The bed was comfy and I loved the decor. There were extra sheets/towels and even a hair dryer which was great since I forgot mine! The couch was also very comfy - again, perfect for two people. The location itself was great - easy access to diff neighborhoods. At the end of each day I was very happy to head back and would def stay here again. I didnt get to meet Tonya personally, but she sounds great and was an accomodating host! The checkout was also super easy. If you're looking for a nice place to call home away from home, stay here![QWERTY123]Nice place; clean quiet and well-equipped kitchen.[QWERTY123]Estuvimos en NY durante una semana conociendo la ciudad. Este departamento es Ideal para conocer manhattan, siendo que esta muy bien ubicado y cerca de varias bocas de subte que te trasladas ne pocos minutos a cualquier parte de la ciudad.
El departamento en general no es super lujoso ni nada, pero igualmente es muy comodo. El trato fue excelente y por ellos nos sentimos super comodas. Esperamos volver pronto y seguro contactaremos a Tonya nuevamente.


[QWERTY123]apto bem centralizado.[QWERTY123]Very good location, very good place for young people, every thing are very near.
The apartment was not very clean, no chair to seat, no table to eat comfortably, the main bed was not so good and we got also some trouble with the bathroom, but Tonya and Wilson were very nice and helpful.
I was only to old to stay there!![QWERTY123]Very nice, well-equipped and comfortable appartment. Well located and with easy access to most of the places tourists visit in NY. Everything worked perfect and it was easy to check in as soon as we arrive to the city. Our experience was very satisfactory and we would definitely come back![QWERTY123]APARTAMENTO MUY CÉNTRICO. MUY LIMPIO. INCLUYE TODO EL EQUIPAMIENTO ANUNCIADO. LLEGAMOS MUY TARDE POR CULPA DE LOS VUELOS Y NOS ESPERABAN IGUALMENTE PARA EL CHECK-IN.[QWERTY123]We were very pleased with our stay at Tonyas. The location of this place is perfect, restaurants, shopping, pubs, clubs, time square, subway access, everything we wanted to experience when going to NYC, all so close. It's a cozy place that will comfortably sleep three people, more if you double up in beds. The only issue we had was with the wireless Internet, which did not work. This was a nuisance as we are from out of the country and use our Internet for much of the day planning, therefore or phone bills became very expensive.[QWERTY123]We stayed at NYC during the hurrican Sandy. Tonya gave us all the assistance we needed.
The apartment was perfect and very clean.[QWERTY123]My friends and I stayed in Tonya's apartment for 13 nights and had an amazing time in NYC!! This apartment was quite small but is good in accommodating up to three people. It also didn't appear to be very clean but just some maintenance here and there would really refresh its look and appeal. Tonya was a fantastic host who answered any of my concerns or questions very quickly and was very helpful during our entire stay. The LOCATION of this apartment was phenomenal - 10 mins walking distance to Times Square, subway around the corner and central to many key NYC spots. Towards the end of our time in NY the apartment really did start to feel like home and we all would come back and rent from Tonya again![QWERTY123]This apartment was in a great area of NYC! Don't let the street front deceive you.  Things were clean and was a good size.  It's definitely darker than the pictures and I wouldn't recommend more than 4 people since the fold out futon is not very comfortable.  Tonya did reply right away to an email when we couldn't find more toilet paper and couldn't get the sofa to fold down which was great.  

Great location, and good space.[QWERTY123]A great apartment in a great spot- my friends and I had a great time in NYC, and big thanks to Tanya for her great place![QWERTY123]Situated in a great location.  The apartment was definitely not spacious even though the pics make it look spacious.  The beds were comfortable.  The loft bed is smaller.  4 persons stayed.  The plumbing in the shower/bath is very slow to drain and was full of hair.  There is a plunger and a strainer there but it definitely needs attention.  The keys were available as advised.  The price was very reasonable.  You don't get the street noise which is good.[QWERTY123]Situated in a great location, near subways, restaurants and make it easy to enjoy the whole city. The apt is less spacious than the pics let think, but still good value for money. A little bit dark as the window shows the back of the building, but the plus is thus that the place is really quiet for a very central NY street. Definitely for not more than 4 people, (so maybe ""Super Large"" is not exact) but enough to spend the nights. We did not met Tonya but Winston, the superintendant, was of great help. Enjoy your stay ![QWERTY123]Great Location, no doubt it will be really comfortable for 4 people, quite old but really worthy
[QWERTY123]This was our first stay with airbnb and it was excellent. Easy checkin and checkout, comfortable accommodations and great location close to subway and restaurants on 26th St, plus groceries and CVS. Very walkable to Little Italy, NYU, and lots of shopping on 5th Avenue. I really appreciated being able to book on short notice. Way better than a hotel.[QWERTY123]The perfect way to enjoy NYC!  The apartment was perfect, more than enough room and was very clean.  Being located a few steps from 5th Ave and Broadway it was a fantastic location - easy to grab a cab, subway and citibikes!  Walking distance to many great coffee shops, delis and fabulous restaurants.
Check in was simple, and Tonya was always accessible and accommodating - so happy have been able to experience the city through Tonya's apartment and neighborhood!  I'll be back![QWERTY123]We had a great experience staying here. The place was clean and the location is amaizing. I can't wait to come back.[QWERTY123]We had an assignment in New York and needed a home for an extended stay.  This apartment fit our needs perfectly.   The gentlemen who work in the building are professional and made us feel safe.  The apartment had everything we needed and was clean when we arrived.  The location was amazing, easy walk to multiple trains.  Everything from booking throughout the stay was professional and very easy to work with.  Owner contacted us several times throughout stay to check in. Every time we saw the gentlemen who worked here they always asked if we were ok and if we needed anything.   Great place, great people.  Highly recommend it.[QWERTY123]The location is the major selling point here.  Seconds from the Flatiron building, meaning you're right in the Manhattan action.

If you aren't super fussy about the ""design"" aspect of the space, then this is your best option.  Ultimately, you're in New York.. no one spends time in their apartment and neither will you.[QWERTY123]Las fotos del apartamento no correspondían exactamente al apartamento que alquilamos, sino a otro del mismo edificio similar. Cuando llegamos el apartamento estaba muy sucio, pero llamamos a Tonya y se hizo cargo de ello muy rápido,  en el mismo día llamó a una mujer de la limpieza y lo solucionó.  El barrio está bien y la localización muy buena. Buena comunicación con todo Manhattan pues hay varias paradas de metro cerca. Tonya nos hizo sentir como en casa y en general la experiencia fue buena. Sitio recomendable por la localización.  Gracias! Xx[QWERTY123]Tonya Thank you for hosting us!  it was great.[QWERTY123]Tonya’s place is truly a home away from home. It’s in a great place in the city for first time visitors since it’s smack dab in the middle of Manhattan!  It’s relatively close to the subways and blocks away from some really great attractions and restaurants.  Tonya is very easy to talk to, and because she lives so close, she is always there to lend a hand or give some useful advice in a time of need. She and Winston were very helpful to us during our stay on more than one occasion.  My only small complaint is that the WiFi and signal in the apartment was a bit spotty at times which made working from home a bit of a hassle. You gotta find that sweet spot where you can connect your devices and get decent signal — aka just move closer to the window till you hit it!  Honestly though, that is such a small thing compared to what the apartment offers. I always felt secure coming home and I knew that my room and my things were always safe. For the location and the amenities (I.e. full kitchen, fire stick TV, two beds, plenty of storage, etc.) you can’t beat the price. I would definitely come stay here again and recommend it to any of my friends staying in the city."	40.74357176570195	-73.98998746353294	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/5216	4	126.0	0.7875
24	17298	"Thank you so much! My fam had a great time![QWERTY123]Bella casa, nel quartiere Bedford. Chris, l'assistente di Nicolas, è davvero cordiale. La casa è così come presentata in foto; è a due passi da un market abbastanza fornito. In metropolitana bastano 20 minuti per raggiungere manhattan, l'appartamento è a due passi dalle fermate kingston-throop e utica sulla linea C. Consigliato a gruppi di amici e/o famiglie.[QWERTY123]Nicolas' apartment was BEAUTIFUL! Exactly as seen in pictures. The apartment is (mostly - except for the white chair that had to be covered with a sheet) very clean. We received clean linens and towels upon request. 
We never saw or spoke with Nicolas, but Chris, his assistant, was very helpful and always gave us everything we needed. 
The location could be better - it is NOT 2 blocks from the subway station, as mentioned. It's more like a 7-10 minute walk. The subway ride to Manhattan is about 15 minutes to the downtown area. about 45 minutes to central Manhattan (Central Park area). There is a very nice restaurant downstairs, many little markets (some even 24/7. Convenient!) and a big supermarket less than 10 minutes away!
Overall, we had a great stay at Modern Brownstone Living 3. We would defiantly stay there again and recommend this apartment to our friends![QWERTY123]Nicolas was very responsive when we were booking and also tried to work with us when we were concerned about whether to cancel our trip after Hurricane Sandy. His associate Chris was at the Brownstone as scheduled when we arrived and 15 minutes early at our departure with our deposit of cash in hand which worked well for us. The Modern Brownstone was almost exactly what we expected, perhaps even slightly larger then the pictures show. We ended up bringing only 3 of our 4 children which was good because I think it would have been a bit tight with too large boys sharing a trundle bed in the living room. Our only real complaint about the Brownstone would be the heating. It was almost unbearably hot when we arrived and continued to be erratic throughout our stay. Mostly we left all the windowns open 24-7 to cool off but it led to some uncomfortable sleeping at times. The apartment was acceptably clean and there were a few cleaning supplies and adequate kitchen items for our use. Enough clean towels and iinens for everyone. I was pleasantly surprised to find a hairdryer in the bathroom. This is not a good choice if those using the master bedroom are looking for privacy as everyone has to walk through the master to get to the one bathroom. The best part of this Brownstone was the location. A short walk from the subway and super-easy to get from JFK and into Manhattan and other parts of Brooklyn. We all bought $29 weekly MTA passes and never once took a cab. There are several convenience stores with fruit, vegetables, sandwiches, etc. and also laundromats nearby if you needed one (we did not). Peaches restaurant 2 blocks away is amazingly good food and we ate there twice. There is also a great coffee shop two doors down from there and several decent bars all within a few blocks. For a family of 5 traveling on a tight budget I would recommend this place for sure. We only once felt a little unsafe in the neighborhood and that was in broad daylight. It is right across from an elementary school and the neighborhood is very settled and residential. I would not recommend this area however for those who are uncomfortable with being in the minority or don't know there way around a big city.[QWERTY123]We rented this 2 bedroom apartment for 2 weeks during the Christmas season and it was great. Chris was always available to help with anything and answer our questions, which was enjoyable. 
The apartment is spacious and was properly equipped. It is on a direct subway line to Manhattan which was very convenient. Laundry and supermarkets are available very near by. 
Great stay![QWERTY123]proprio très sympa et sérieux, très à l'écoute, maison dans quartier calme, pas loin de la station de métro AC permettant de rejoindre Manhattan rapidement[QWERTY123]Propriétaire sérieux. Aucun souci malgré notre arrivée retardée de quelques jours. Nous avons été accueilli par son assistant Chris qui est très serviable.
Appartement propre situé à 5 min du Metro Ultica (20min de Manhattan par la ligne A) et 5 min d'un supermarché. Facile d'accès depuis l'aéroport JFK avec l'Airtrain.
Quartier agréable et calme. Avec nos deux enfants, ils nous arrivaient de rentrer en métro à la nuit tombée et aucun problème.
Aucun souci pour récupérer la caution

Juillet 2013[QWERTY123]Nous avons séjourné du 18 au 31 aout 2013 chez Nicolas.
Tout c'est très bien passé, appartement tel que décrit sur le site, aucune surprise désagréable (sauf peut-être la chambre avec les lits superposés qui n'a pas de fenêtre). Quartier très agréable, petit restaurant à coté et le Métro est à 7mm en passant par un petit parc où vivent des petits écureuil et des joueurs d'échecs.
Sejour excellent à tous niveaux.
Je recommande.vivement cette adresse qui est au calme, ce qui est appréciable après l'agitation de Manhatan.
Chris, l'assistant de Nicolas est aux petits soins pour tous.
Un grand merci à lui;[QWERTY123]If you are looking for nice, quiet, affordable and clean place to stay in NYC then this can be it. 

The apartment looks exactly as on the pictures. No luxus, but everything essential. First I was bit sceptical about security but it was only because we have different buildings and building standards here in Europe. It was actually really safe with the middle school across the street. What is important is that apartment was really clean - no hair, no bugs, no bedbugs, clean towels and clean bedsheets. Soap, toilet paper, trash bags and some cleaning supplies were provided. Kitchen is well equipped. And in the night there was actually very quiet, no need for earplugs. WiFi was working well. Hot water all day long.

In the neighborhood there was nice restaurant and groceries nearby. In the grocery store there is this charming older shop assistant - we liked him very much :-) However, as is mentioned in earlier review here - this neighborhood is not for those who are not comfortable being in minority. But it was really safe and in the nearby park there were men playing the chess during the evenings.

Utica subway station is few minutes away and it is the direct line to Manhattan. Please be aware that smaller stations don`t have escalators and lifts so be careful when you have heavier luggage as we did.

Communication with Nicolas and his assistant Chris was smooth. Responses were quick, they were really reliable and left us their email addresses and phone numbers. There was no problem with security deposit either.

Overall - I would definitely recommend this apartment. It was lovely, new and enriching experience for us :-) Thank you :-)[QWERTY123]Bon accueil par Chris, l'assistant du propriétaire
Appart propre, lits confortables
Bien situé (5 min du Metro Utica, qui est desservi par une ligne express = 20 mn de Manhattan).
Quartier très agréable et calme, petit restaurant sympa au bout de la rue, épiceries /deli's à tous les coins de rues
Aucun souci pour récupérer la caution[QWERTY123]Nice place for 6 people if you are looking for a relatively cheap place. It was clean and not far from the subway. You can get into Williamsburg in about 25 minutes as well. The area is friendly and safe.[QWERTY123]Excellent accommodation, in a great neighborhood. Right near the A&C line which takes you right into Manhattan, and there is lots of great places to eat in Bed-Stuy.[QWERTY123]L'activité touristique étant principalement sur Manhattan, l'appartement est à 2 ou 3 stations de métro trop loin. Nous avons vécu des interruptions de service du métro systématiques le WE qui ont rendu pénible les déplacements (Complétement indépendant de notre hôte !). Le quartier est complètement sûr & montre une image différente de NYC. Les habitants voisins sont prêts au dialogue. La prestation est à minima, une réelle négligence concernant la propreté des fenêtres (à mettre sur le compte du système d'ouverture en guillotine + moustiquaires qui rendent inaccéssibles les vitres extérieures). Quelques problèmes de robinetterie qui doivent être résolus aujourd'hui. La vue principale donne sur une rue arboré face à une école. La vue sur cours est ... indigne. Chris, l'assistant, est accessible, serviable, sympa. Une grande souplesse pour les ''Check-In'' & ''Check-out''. Globalement, si 1 système de notation existait, la note serait de 6/10.[QWERTY123]Thanks to Nicolas and his deputy Chris for good accomodation! The apartments were clean, there was everything what we expected and the owner always was in touch and quickly responsed on all our questions.
The location of the apartment is really good (near subway stations, good cafe Brunswick and restourant Peaches, food shops).
Our stay (we are 3 friends) was really nice![QWERTY123]Great location in a safe neighborhood,  both Chris and Nicholas were very helpful, apartment is well looked after and very tidy.[QWERTY123]Het contact met de verhuurder vooraf verliep prima. Zijn assistent Chris was ook goed te bereiken en heeft alles goed uitgelegd. Prima airbnb-adres voor toeristen die naar New York willen.[QWERTY123]Grazioso appartamento  ""vintage"", ben attrezzato. Quartiere tranquillo, ben collegato con metropolitana sia all'aeroporto JFK, che al centro.[QWERTY123]Everything was good! Big and clean apartment! Thank You!![QWERTY123]NIce Brownstone accommodation. Everything as described, well organized, good infrastructure etc. We felt very comfortable.[QWERTY123]Great place! Very good host, worked easily with our specific circumstances. Our freind was concerned when we said we were staying in Bedstuy, but we found no reason to worry. Neighbors were friendly, street was quiet, walked to subway entrance several times without concern. Left car in street parking without incident. One point:  the third bed is actually in the same room as the kitchen/eating area. Not a problem, but it was hard to see in the pictures. Wholly enjoyable week! Would stay here again in a heartbeat![QWERTY123]NIce Brownstone accommodation. We felt very comfortable. If you plan to stay with many people,I recommend this house![QWERTY123]We had a great stay in this appartment! It's big enough for 5 people. Check-in and Check-out was without any problems. 
I can only recommend this appartment.[QWERTY123]Good House!It was not inconvenient.I had good stay! Thanks![QWERTY123]Verschrikkelijk veel stof en veel geuroverlast. Mooie locatie maar appartement zeker niet aan te bevelen ![QWERTY123]As a group who travels a lot for work, we often stay in Airbnbs. We previously stayed here in the fall while working in Brooklyn (but in two different apartments in the building). We liked it so much, we came back. Nicolas is excellent at communicating and accommodating our various check-in / check-out needs. The neighborhood is great, and the building and apartments within are quite charming.

Thank you for another great stay![QWERTY123]Very good place, the neighborhood is very safe and there are two metro stops nearby.
My only complaint is about the cleanliness otherwise all very well
Recommended[QWERTY123]Nicolas was very nice accomadating the arrival very early in the morning!

Thanks![QWERTY123]The host canceled this reservation 4 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.[QWERTY123]Great Time, thanks![QWERTY123]L'alloggio è valido nel rapporto qualità prezzo (siamo a new york) dovrebbe essere curata meglio la pulizia dei pavimenti e dei vetri alle finestre.[QWERTY123]We enjoyed Nicola‘s place a lot. 
Nicolas made things very easy for us.
The apartment is far enough from the city to give you a neighborhood feel, yet well connected to Manhattan and Brooklyn.[QWERTY123]We loved this apartment. The locations is perfect, and the neighborhood super nice! The apartment was super clean, we had everything we needed (sheets, towels etc.) We were between 3-4 people and shared all rooms. Important to know is maybe that the bedroom has no extra door so people will have to walk through there to reach the bathroom. Nonetheless this wasn't much of a problem to us. 

Overall Nicolas was an amazing host who always answered within seconds and made this stay perfect for us![QWERTY123]A great place to stay with your family.[QWERTY123]Really big space in New York for your buck![QWERTY123]Bien comunicado, barrio interesante, bien para una familia de 4/5 miembros. Bien equipado y con tiendas y supermercados en las proximidades."	40.682905605386644	-73.93663815279464	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/17298	6	180.0	0.9
25	17299	"Nice place, both Nic and Chris who manage the place we're really friendly. Great to have free wifi.[QWERTY123]The apartment was a lot like extended executive housing. The place was huge, and a great value for the number of people it could host in the city. It was very convenient to public transit. Nicolas and his assistant, Chris were extremely easy to work with and accommodating with check-in and check-out times, and the apartment was as described in the listing.

One word of caution - I'll say that while the place was just what we needed, my friend and I did have a crime incident in the neighborhood. If you plan to come and go late at night, I'd recommend caution.[QWERTY123]Nicolas has a very nice apartment, which is located in Brooklyn, 40 minutes by subway to Manhattan. Near by it placed a wonderful restaurant ""Peaches"" with a great food. Apartment is nice and very budget, and Nicolas and Lewis (his host) are very nice and great.[QWERTY123]We had a great time in Nicolas apartment. Nice calm street, nice and clean apartment, uncomplicated transaction. Looking forward to come back. Special thanks to Chris who did the check-in and check-out![QWERTY123]The neighbourhood is wonderfull - green, quite but quite close to the next subway station. Nicolas´ assistant was anxious to be of service where and whenever it was neccessary and the communication worked without any problems. The technical standard might be a bit different to a western european but everything was clean and that´s basically the reason for travelling this (authentic) way.... 
Summary: A recomenndable place.[QWERTY123]We had a lovely time in Nicolas' apartment. Nicolas and Chris were very obliging and very responsive to any queries or requests. The apartment is very spacious and comfortable. We would highly recommend it as a place to stay in New York.[QWERTY123]Nice place in Brooklyn pretty close to centrum.[QWERTY123]flat was ok , not more
conveniently situated, calm neighborhood.
cleanliness was just ok.[QWERTY123]Appartement très sympas dans Brooklyn
Métro a proximité et commerces ouvert 24h/24h bien utile
Appartement propre et lits confortables
Excellent séjour

[QWERTY123]Brooklyn Baby  ! ;) Schreibe für alle deutschen die mal Brooklyn / NYC bereisen wollen mal auf deutsch. Die Wohnung liegt in einer ruhigen Gegend allerdings sollte man erwähnen das direkt gegenüber ne Junior High School ist --- somit morgens etwas laut aber gut man will ja eh früh raus was sehen :D Die Fotos der Wohnung stimmen soweit allerdings ist  doch alles ein wenig ""abgewohnt"" für den Preis denke ich aber  in Ordnung. Die Kommunikation mit Chris dem Housekeeper zwecks check in/out verlief problemlos. Bis zur Subway sind es fünf Min. zu fuss und von da ca 20- 25  min bis inmitten Manhatten --perfekt ! In der Umgebung befinden zahlreiche Deli/ 24 Kioske und ein Supermarkt für das nötigste. Ausserdem sind direkt an der Ecke gute Bars/Restaurants zum feiern würd ich aber aber lieber nach Williamsburg oder East Village nach Manhatten. Alles in allem für den Preis gut ( hab für 14 tage ca 400 Euro bezahlt !) checkts einfach aus B)[QWERTY123]The right place at the right time. Perfect brooklyn experience[QWERTY123]We had a great time in this apartment ! Enough space, pretty well equipped and the most important : very good situation juste near the subway ! 
Unfortunately we did not have wifi during 5 days ! Only on the 2 last days the wifi was working ... 
And there is also mouse in the house ! 

Apart of that we were 7 friends in this apartment and we really enjoy ![QWERTY123]We had a very good stay in NY !  The appartment was great, clean and not far from Manhattan. Thanks to Chris and Nicolas for their kindness![QWERTY123]L Appart est sympa, proche du métro et proche de Manhattan (environ 15 minutes du sud de Manhattan ) le quartier est tranquille. On a beaucoup apprécié notre séjour la bas.[QWERTY123]Notre séjour en octobre s'est finalement très bien déroulé, après des craintes d'annulation dues aux grèves des pilotes Air France. Nicolas a été très compréhensif et arrangeant pour les dates de séjour. Son logement est idéalement placé à Brooklyn, non loin du métro pour toutes les visites sur Manhattan. Côté confort et entretien, un petit rafraichissement serait bienvenu, mais l'appartement est assez spacieux pour quatre. Le quartier est calme, face à une école, et Chris est très discret mais attentif.[QWERTY123]The apartment was clean and tidy and basic things were provided. But literally only the basics. The kitchen was as good as (Website hidden by Airbnb) oil, vinegar, pepper. Other than that it was good to spend the night. Everything looks a little bit more spacious on the pictures but it's more than enough to stay there with a group of two or three. The shower was a little hard to handle and the apartment is not taken care of with a lot of love but as I said it's alright if you're just visiting the city. The next Metro Stops are in 5-10 minutes walking distance which is fine. Groceries and a wine market are also right around the corner. Chris took care of our check-in and check-out which worked out fine and we were also able to leave the suitcases in his office since our flight wasn't until after check-out time.[QWERTY123]Die Kommunikation mit Nicoloas zwecks 
Check-In war sehr höflich, nett und problemlos. Obwohl wir früher als erwartet eintrafen, war Chris, der Housekeeper,  bereits anwesend. 
Die Wohnung liegt in einer ruhigen Gegend. Die ""Linie A"" ist in ca. 8 Min. - zu Fuß - erreichbar. Man ist nach rund 25 Min. Fahrtzeit Mitten in Manhatten oder am JFK-Flughafen. Das ist perfekt! 
In der Umgebung befinden einige Delis und einen Supermarkt. In unmittelbarer Nähe sind auch zwei Bars/Restaurants. Schauen sehr nett aus, ausprobiert haben wir sie allerdings nicht, da wir meisten in Manhatten unterwegs waren.
Die Wohnung ist zwar schon ein bisschen abgewohnt, aber sauber. Wir waren zu 5 und haben uns sehr wohlgefühlt.   Ein gutes Preis-/Leistungsverhältnis . Wir würden wieder buchen.[QWERTY123]Cris es muy amable y siempre esta disponible para cualquier duda o consulta. Todo esta muy bien explicado acerca de los alrededores, check in, check out, wifi. El piso es justo como en la descripción. El barrio es seguro y esta bien comunicado por metro[QWERTY123]Todo salió de acuerdo a lo pactado, es un lugar acogedor, limpio, queda cerca al metro y además Chris es muy atento. Gracias[QWERTY123]Overall a good experience. Apartment looks a little classier in the pictures, but was still more than comfortable for a family of five to stay for 9 nights. Neighborhood is friendly and calm (despite it's initial appearance to someone flying in from Europe). Very well connected to the JFK airport and downtown/midtown Manhattan. Housekeeper was friendly and approachable, he even waited for us for 3hrs when our arrival was delayed by airport services (ty Chris). Would recommend. 
[QWERTY123]Good ""Brooklyn"" experience. Neighborhood is calm and safe and subway is close, but it takes 30 min to mid-Manhattan. Apartment is cozy and comfortable for 5-6 people. The best is Chris who is avalaible for any problem that can arise. Thanks Chris. The only issues are how to manage the shower the first day and the fine curtains in main room ( if you want to sleep during the day). Overall Great family experience.[QWERTY123]Great Value for Money....Nicolas' flat is well located, very close to 2 metro stations. The street is nice. Nicolas has been very flexible in terms of check in and check out timings.[QWERTY123]Chris made us feel very comfortable. All instructions were clear and informative. We stayed for 5 nights and felt comfortable at this place. The Utica avenue metro is 7 min walk and connects very well. The neighbourhood is quiet and peaceful. The only drawback we had was that we had only one toilet-bathroom, but then we knew about it when we booked and managed this constraint. Chris provided with extra fan promptly, much appreciate it. Shops are nearby for quick grocery purchase and we found ourselves at ease. Thanks for a wonderful experience.[QWERTY123]Fuimos en agosto del 2015, el departamento es muy lindo, estaba muy limpio, es un edificio con un encanto arquitectonicamente antiguo pero totalmente renovado en su interior. Habían toallas, jabón, sabanas limpias, detergente, esponja, vajilla. Mucho mejor que un hotel. El lugar muy seguro y el barrio tambien. Volviamos en subte entre las 11 de la noche y 1 de la mañana y nos sentimos muy seguros caminando por la zona con las bolsas de compras. De hecho hay locales abiertos a esa hora. El anfitrion nos recibio muy amablemente, de hecho, yo me confundi con el horario de llegada (llegue 12 horas antes) y el dueño soluciono el problema al instante. El lugar esta a 50 min del empire state, entre caminar, esperar el subte, pero no nos importo, porq la zona es hermosa! Lo recomiendo mucho. No defrauda.[QWERTY123]Mi avión llego al JFK y tome airtrain seguido del subway que en 25 a 30 min, baje en la estación Utica Av (también puedes bajarte en Kingston Throopers) quedando solo a 4 cuadras del apartamento.

Me recibió Chris, el asistente de Nicolas, quien fue muy amable y atento a nuestras solicitudes.

El apartamento es acogedor y perfecto para 8 personas, lo encontramos limpio y ordenado, como ya les había comentado, se encuentra a 4 cuadras de 2 estaciones del subway ( en donde pasan las lineas A y C) que te llevan directamente a Manhattan en 25 min, la zona es muy tranquila, casi todos los días llegábamos alrededor de la medianoche y era seguro.

Es totalmente recomendable para un grupo mayor a 7 personas.

En conclusión, es muy buen sitio para rentar ya que la comodidad y la ubicación del apartamento permiten conocer tranquilamente NYC.[QWERTY123]Merci a Nicolas pour nous avoir accueilli a la dernière minute suite a un problème avec l'appart de RichardDene (voir mon commentaire sur cet appart)
Appartement parfait pour 4 d'une même famille mais petit pour 7 personnes de 2 familles du fait qu'il y a une seule salle de bain et un seul WC. Les lits confortables, les draps propres ainsi que le linge de maison. La cuisine est un peu minimaliste en terme d'équipement.
Les escaliers sont assez raides donc pas facile si vous avez des difficultés de mobilité  
Il faudrait faire un petit effort sur le ménage car il n'est pas au top. Le quartier ne craint pas, et assez sympa avec pas mal de petits resto et de bar a proximité
  Il est bien situé car à 5 min d'une station de métro directe vers Manhattan (Ligne A ou C)
Une personne, Chris vous accueillera et vous donnera toutes les infos nécessaires a votre séjour et il est la tout le temps si vous avez un souci avec le logement.
On vous le recommande car il est très agréable 







[QWERTY123]We had a great time in Brooklyn.
The flat is well located. You are in 35min by train at the Times Square.
The flat is bis and clean. Pls consider that one room is a channel room without a window.
Nicholas and Chris are very friendly and cooperative.[QWERTY123]The host canceled this reservation 81 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.[QWERTY123]We stayed for almost eight weeks in Nicolas three bed room apartment and had a nice stay. His assistant Chris was always very helpful and kind. Thank you! Unfortunately I also have to mention that the apartment was not very clean and the kitchen was not well equipped. For this price range we expected more.[QWERTY123]Recepção muito tranquila e pontual conforme o combinado, o bairro e bem típico do Brooklyn, nos remetendo a vários filmes do passado.

[QWERTY123]Our stay at Nicolas' apartment was a very good experience ! The space is exactly like in the photos and Chris, Nicolas's assistant was always there if we had a problem ! The apartment is also quite quiet so it is nice spending time there! 
However we thought the place was dirtier than on the photos, and the kitchen not very well equipped ! 
Nicolas's apartment is, all in all, a great place to stay for one or two weeks![QWERTY123]We stayed at Nicolas apartment for three months and it was really great. Nicolas and Chris were very kind and helpful. The neighborhood is save with nice restaurants and a supermarket. 20-25min with the A-Train to Downtown Manhattan is acceptable. All in all the apartment was very satisfying and I can definitely recommend it.[QWERTY123]The host canceled this reservation 3 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.[QWERTY123]it was  great to  stay n transportation was perfect to get to Manhattan n hot spot in Newyork.
Nicolas was kind n whenever I had to  ask he respond quickly.[QWERTY123]Chris was a great host. The accuracy of the listing of a 3 bedroom is not accurate. It is a walk through two bedroom with a bed in the living room.[QWERTY123]Very good price you can find in NYC, and it has the basics of what you need. Chris was really helpful and responsive.[QWERTY123]Wonderful place to stay while visiting this amazing city!![QWERTY123]We loved the house and the neighborhood. We spent more than a month in this area of Brookly. The neighborhood is quiet and residential, in front of a school. With a supermarket nearby, Laundry, Deli, Peaches restaurant and close to the Blue Line metro. Nicolas is attentive and answers all emails or questions. Chris, the concierge lives on the floor below. The Brooklyn Bridge is about an hour walk away, and Manhattan is about 45 minutes away by subway. Thank you for everything Nicolas and for being flexible and attentive in our doubts and suggestions. We will be back!!!"	40.682759729881404	-73.93502572625735	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/17299	8	180.0	0.775
26	17693	"Such amazing hosts, at such a beautiful place. Your soulful home in NYC away from home. We couldn't have had better place to stay on our weeks getaway. Two minutes walk to the subway station, really easy to travel everywhere. Most definitely coming back, already missing Tye and Etienne![QWERTY123]Ich fühlte mich sehr willkommen und von den sehr lieben Gastgebern hilfreich unterstützt. Tye und Etienne sind völlig unkompliziert. Das Zimmer ist klein, aber urig und ziemlich ruhig . Die Lage im nördlicheren Harlem ist dank der sehr nahen Subway-Station sehr günstig.[QWERTY123]Etienne was so friendly , and welcoming , she has such a positive vibrant personality she made you feel welcomed and helped me with everything I needed , a wonderful host , she went above and beyond to make sure I was doing well . The place was easy to find , the room was clean , comfortable , and had a coffee machine for the morning , drawers and closet for storage, highly recommend ![QWERTY123]Tye and Etienne were super nice and friendly. The place is at the same block as the subway station so that was very convenient. I enjoyed staying with them![QWERTY123]Tye and Etienne were so generous with their beautiful home. Felt comfortable and taken care of from the moment I stepped in. Warm conversation, friendly advice, and a beautiful home in Harlem. Extremely close to the subway and surplus of good food in the area. Definitely coming back![QWERTY123]Tye and Etienne really make you feel welcome. The street is quiet, the trains are right there. Good restaurants nearby. This is a great place to stay.[QWERTY123]I had a wonderful experience staying here.  From the very first moment, I felt completely at home. Tye and Etienne are fantastic hosts - communicative, friendly, and just lovely all around.  The room and all shared spaces were comfortable, clean, and had that cozy vibe you feel when you are somewhere with lots of love in it.

The apartment is literally next door to the subway entrance, and there are many cool things to explore nearby - food, book stores, and nice places to walk along the river.  I could go on and on... I would recommend this place to anyone (or any couple) looking to experience Harlem or NYC in general.[QWERTY123]Die Wohnung von Tye & Etienne ist nur ca. 50 m von der Subway entfernt, und man ist schnell überall in Manhattan. Beide sind großartige Gastgeber und fragen regelmäßig nach, ob man etwas braucht. Nach der Ankunft an einem heißen Sommerabend haben sie extra Eistee für meinen Jungen bereitgestellt.
In der näheren Umgebung finden sich jede Menge kleiner Läden, ca. 5 Gehminuten braucht man zum größeren Supermarkt.
Wir kommen gern wieder - die Gastgeber haben ihr Zuhause für uns geöffnet, sodass wir uns schnell zu Hause gefühlt haben.[QWERTY123]Tye and Etienne are excellent hosts and their B&B is excellently situated just one subway stop away from Yankee Stadium (very cheap taxi ride, too, if that's more your cup of tea).  Good apartment, great people.  Thanks![QWERTY123]Great hosts. Very kind . Doors dont have locks (room and bathroom)[QWERTY123]This is worth the money. Everything is as described in the listing. Tye and Etienne are awesome. Great location. Easy accessibility to the trains. Good times :)[QWERTY123]Had a fantastic 5 day stay in Tye and Etienne's stylish Washington Heights apartment. It's literally 50 feet from the busy 155th street C stop, delicious food, coffee, laundromat and everything the neighborhood has to offer. The room was cozy and clean as was the bathroom, both of which lock from the inside. The experience was close to having the place to ourselves as our hosts and the other guest were not around very much during the hours we were there. They also have a rescue dog who we saw once or twice during our stay but wasn't around much either and didn't interact with us at all. They were extremely responsive to every message and helped us out extremely quickly when we had questions. Would definitely stay again![QWERTY123]Excelente localidad , lugar tranquilo y cerca del tren[QWERTY123]Tye and Etienne are super friendly and the place is exactly as advertised.  

*yes the door locks in the bathroom.  Would recommend this place if looking for an easy place to crash[QWERTY123]Great place, great people. The apartment is really nice and comfortable, with an artistic flair, the area is central and yet calm, metro just 100 meters away. You have your own space and come and go whenever you like. Tye and Etienne are really very helpful. My place of choice if I come back, for sure.[QWERTY123]Best feature is how close this is to public transit yet without any real street noise. Very safe, locked building. Elevator is a plus. Very responsive and helpful hosts who are proactive in offering assistance but ensured my privacy. Great proximity to Yankee stadium. Room is definitely only big enough for one person. One can get to central Harlem (Sylvias, etc) on a single 20 mins bus ride that stops a block away. There is a lock on the inside of the bedroom and bath but no way to lock bedroom from outside when you leave if that's a big deal. I didn't have any problems. Pretty much everything a lone traveler needs on their way thru. Laundry and a small deli/convenience store next door.[QWERTY123]My partner and I recently took a trip to New York, and on our first night found out our hotel got our booking wrong. As a result we were left to find accommodation super last minute.
Tye and Etienne took on our booking without any hesitation 3 days before Christmas and went the extra effort to fix their bathroom up (renovations) in time for us to enjoy our stay.
Upon our arrival we were greeted by Etienne who showed us around the place and was sure to make us feel comfy.
Now this review could have easily continued into a normal 'stay and review' situation, but as fate would have it, not long after we arrived at Tye and Etienne's my parents called with a back-up plan to our hotel booking failure, and decided to put us up in NY without the need to continue our 6 days in the Airbnb.
At this stage that left us with an awkward conversation to be had with Etienne as we knew the effort the couple had put into the place and the arrangements they had made last minute to make our stay comfortable.
Although when we had this conversation Etienne was very understanding and considerate of the sudden change of plan and made the necessary calls to organize a win for both parties. 
Even though their preference was set to 'strict' for bookings and payments, Tye and Etienne made sure that both parties were comfortable with a 50/50 split payment and graciously refunded us half of our booking.
The ongoing communications between us were well managed and even though this wasn't a full stay at Tye and Etienne's residence i have full confidence that their home and hospitality would have been superb. The way they understood our situation and accommodated it on the fly was hands down a reason why I would recommend staying with these two to anyone looking for a relaxing, vibrant and welcoming stay within Harlem, NY.
Thanks again Tye and Etienne, will definitely be coming back on our next trip to NYC.[QWERTY123]Great place to stay in New York, and great hospitality from Tye and Etienne.[QWERTY123]Great people![QWERTY123]200 feet from Subway. Very lively neighborhood, short walk to Harlem, Hamilton Heights.[QWERTY123]Хозяева бесконечно позитивные и добрые с прекрасным чувством юмора. Тая и Этьен помогали нам по всем вопросам, которые у нас возникали: подсказывали куда пойти, что поделать. Все советы были полезными и точными, например, ходили на 125 улицу за покупками (понравился магазин Marshalls) и в бар на Вест Вилладж. 
Расположение жилья очень хорошее, рядом с метро. Гарлем понравился. Недалеко до центра, много вкусных кафе рядом.
Комната небольшая, но очень уютная. Дополнительный бонус - кофеварка. Доступ на кухню и в уборную без каких либо ограничений, везде чисто, все удобно.
На кухне куча электроприборов и еще одна кофеварка, чайник.
Завтрак был включен в проживание.[QWERTY123]Tye and Etienne’s is exactly what is advertised and more! It is a lovely, colorful, cheery, and warm home that will give you all of the good feels of Harlem! Both Tye and Etienne are very accommodating, effective communicators, calm, friendly, and sweet. There are these cookies and tea that they leave in the room that are TO DIE FOR! The bed is cozy, the house is clean...They accommodated my arrival (greeting me with wine and bottled water), and even allowed me to leave my bags while I rushed around the city running last minute errands to catch my flight. (Tye even made me a delicious farewell breakfast when I left!) The apartment is a stones throw away from public transit, and is on a nice block. I love how everyone knows everyone else, and call out to each other by name on the street-helping older ladies across. THIS is Harlem...if you want that experience...stay here with Tye and Etienne...you won’t regret it! I know every time I’m in town, I will certainly be trying to stay here! Thank you so much for a wonderful (Website hidden by Airbnb) only regret was that I couldn’t stay longer!![QWERTY123]Worked excellent for my stay. Had to be in Manhattan every day, C Subway on same block, 22 minute ride definitely  worth saving $150 a night on hotel, while getting the subway 'experience'! Tip- C train stops running late at night but A train will make the late night local stops including 155th. One night the stop was closed for construction and I had to walk from 145th at 2:30am but route was well lit and I felt safe. Pay attention to street signs though, Saint Nicholas Ave at some point splits off into two streets, the other being Saint Nicholas Place, which is little confusing.  If you are out late be smart and don't flash cell phone and wallet without paying attention to surroundings - just like any other big city. Best kep secret.. walk over the bridge to Yankee Stadium took 16 minutes and Hard Rock Cafe inside stadium has great happy hour on non-game days. Did not get a chance to meet Tye, but Etienne was extremely  cool, gave me a glass of wine upon arrival and cold water whenever I came back from a long day. Always asking if I needed anything. Building is old and full of character. This is not a hotel, it's just visiting your favorite relatives and crashing in their spare room to save a ton of cash while in NYC. If gate to living room is closed, 'Rocco' is in living room, so please let him be, he's an old rescue dog who needs his space. Even with the gate closed, you will have everything you need with your private bedroom, access to bathroom and kitchen fridge, and lightening fast internet. No hesitation about returning next time in NYC![QWERTY123]Etienne is a very kind and helpful host, who prepared for me breakfast with bagel, tea and fruits. The house seems a bit old, but it is not functional, very well-decorated and cozy. The closeness of this place to the subway stations is a pleasant surprise for me, since it only takes a one-minute walk to the 155st station, where the C train can arrive in midtown in around half an hour. I was unfortunately not able to meet Tye, but I had immensely enjoyed my stay. Would 100% recommend![QWERTY123]‌Tye and Etienne has brought the definition of ""super host"" into another level! We moved to Tye and Etienne place after we had safety issue with our other previous booking that made us decide to move to new place. Etienne welcomed us warmly, providing our needs for our stay and even prepare us breakfast for the next day. He really take great care of us just like a caring friend does to you. We had no chance to meet Tye and only texting each other,  but she is always ask to make sure that we are happy and everything is allright with us. The place is clean and comfortable with unique artistic art. We had really good night sleep. 
‌The transport is very easy to go anywhere, even for us the ""very first time NYC visitor"". Train C is just 2 minutes walking from the building, train 1 just 5 minutes away. This is such a dream location. If we ever have chance comeback to NYC, we sure know where to go. Total recommended! Thank you so much Tye and Etienne, you guys made our holiday so sweet and unforgettable.[QWERTY123]Great place[QWERTY123]What a great place for geust.
If you plan to visit New York!
They gave two bottle of great welcome wines for me. And the room was very clean and everything was perfect! Their place near to subway staion makes your trip perfect.
[QWERTY123]Tye and Etienne are the epitome of amazing hosts. From the moment I arrived, they made me feel completely welcome and loved. Their home is beyond gorgeous, and this certainly radiates through to the amenities that they provide. 

They went up and beyond to ensure that my time spent in New York was fruitful and meaningful. I’m itching to get back, and I will certainly make sure to stay at Tye and Etienne’s again![QWERTY123]Tye and Etiene are very friendly and good hosts. They took care some much me. And I will never forget the ice beer that Tye gave me just when i arrived in a hot day.[QWERTY123]Tye and Etienne are amazing hosts.

I highly recommend anyone looking to stay in the area to stay here.[QWERTY123]I had an amazing stay with Etienne and Tye! Though I didn’t get to meet Tye, Etienne was amazing with communication and accommodations. Yes, there is a furry member of the family on property but, I barely heard or saw him/her. My stay with Tye and Etienne just made me feel very comfortable and at home! Everything was clean and very quiet. Full access to anything I needed! Thank you guys so much! I hope I get to stay with you guys again when I visit Harlem( home). Highly recommendable place to stay and highly recommended hosts. I can’t say one wrong thing about my stay here.[QWERTY123]wonderful host with great personality and nice clean room.[QWERTY123]Had a very enjoyable stay. Tye and Etienne are very accommodating and approachable. The living space is kept clean and tidy.[QWERTY123]The apartment and the hosts were charming.[QWERTY123]The room is comfortable and clean.  There is coffee facilities in the room and the hosts have a bottle of wine waiting in the fridge for when you arrive.

The place is just 1 bloc away from Columbia University, 3 blocks from Central Park, only 1 block away from Line 1, 2, 3 trains and 3 blocks from subway A, B, and C, and the neighbourhood is full of great places to eat, drink and shop. 

All this only 20 minutes from downtown... Great experience altogether![QWERTY123]Lena was so helpful and communicative throughout the entire process. Our arrival and departure was incredibly smooth- she arranged for her doorman to have the keys right when we arrived. Her building is beautiful and we had no problems getting anywhere- the 2 metro stops got us everywhere we wanted to be. We couldn't have picked a better place to stay for my first trip to the city![QWERTY123]We had a truly wonderful stay in Lena's apartment. She was a generous and gracious host. She gave us great tips on what to do and where to eat, was very helpful with practical concerns and was so pleasant to communicate with. We give Lena and her perfectly situated apartment our top recommendation![QWERTY123]lena's apartment was a great place to relax after long walks in NY. is a nice place, with two metro stations within walking distance and with incredible markets. I travel with my 10 year old son and was very comfortable.
[QWERTY123]Had a great time! Her place was really clean with a nice modern bathroom. The location was also amazing. We loved that it wasn't right downtown in the middle of tourist-y areas but very close to a few different subway lines.
Also tons of restaurants, grocery stores and other things right around the corner.
Definitely recommended.[QWERTY123]Lena's friendly warm welcome and willingness to advise made our stay most enjoyable. Her apartment is very comfortable and with every convenience within close proximity, it was a great location for our stay in New York. Close to Central and Riverside parks with great places to eat, and a choice of 2 subway lines plus buses close by made getting around Manhattan easy. We highly recommend Lena's.[QWERTY123]Lena's apartment was great and she was a great host. She answered any transportation, restaurant, grocery store questions that we had. We were late getting in from the airport and she changed her plans to accomodate us. I would give her a good recommendation any time.[QWERTY123]Lena was a fantastic host - even though she was on vacation at the time we visited she made sure we felt at home and made arrangements for pick up and drop off of the key. The apartment is really nice and great value - great place to chill out and unwind after a hectic day downtown.[QWERTY123]we've  spent really amazing holidays in lena's place.
the appartement is confortable and pleasant to live in.
there's a lot of deli and other shops around.
definitely a good adress.[QWERTY123]Great place!!! . . location, apt set-up, WINDOWS in every room (a real plus in NY.) etc. Ditto the other reviews.  Am quite familiar with NY and this met all of my expectations.  For a new visitor to NY, this is an excellent home base, with all the comforts of home.

Lena was out of town during our visit, but through email, text messaging, phone calls, her notes and recommendations, etc., everything worked super smooth.  Very delightful person and looking forward to meeting her on our next visit.

Would definitely stay there again, and would recommend to friends.

Thanks, Lena!!

[QWERTY123]I and a friend stayed at Lena's one bedroom apt for 5 nights. The over all experience was good. The location was a very nice area for us. The door man abel was very helpful and nice, really made us feel comfortable and helped us with our stay. The subway is close and there is a store and great pub restaurant on the same block a step away. Although keep in mind, this is a personal apt, and here is no professional cleaning. We did our own cleaning and was respectful of her belongings that were in her apt. Overall Lena was very kind and her place was a Life Saver. Thanks again Lena:) ps. You have a wonderful collection of books and we felt very comfortable. I can see you have a great heart I really appreciate you opening up your home to us. Take care![QWERTY123]Excelent apartment.[QWERTY123]The apartment is great, the neighborhood is really nice and Lena is a perfect host. My stay here was fantastic and I recommend it all of you. The kitchen and the bathroom are new. The bed and the couch are comfortable. Everything was perfect. Thanks Lena for everything. You are a really nice, friendly and helpful person. Enjoy NYC!![QWERTY123]Lena's apartment is well appointed, clean and very comfortable. The renovated kitchen and bathroom are especially pleasant, Coming back to the apartment after big days of experiencing New York was like coming home. The location is excellent - in a quiet part of Manhattan, close to supermarkets and restaurants. With the subway only 5 minutes away, all of New York is virtually at your doorstep. We would highly recommend Lena's apartment. Thanks Lena![QWERTY123]My husband and I were hosted by Lena in this beautiful apartment for 8 days, everything was just perfect, communication very fast, the apartment was clean and well organized, the bathroom is new with very cool materials, the area is north west central park 1 block to the 1 subway 109th street on the broadway, a nice area full of restaurants, shops, supermarkets....We had even the pleasure to meet Lena! We loved the apartment and we hope to come back to NYC soon! Thanks for everything Lena.[QWERTY123]Our stay was comfortable! We would certainly book with Lena again; she was prompt, helpful and very clear in communication.  Great location for access to Columbia University.[QWERTY123]Nice flat & good communication.
We had some issues but was solved with Lena[QWERTY123]Sono stata bene! grazie Lena[QWERTY123]Nice place, excellently localized. Quiet but easy to access (subway Line 01). Very near to Columbia University. The apartment is exactly as described and the host is very attentive to all details. Everything was clean and well organized. The only thing that could be a bit better is the bed mattress, but this is a small detail that won't prevent you from having a good experience.[QWERTY123]The apt was just as pictured. Everything was clean and welcoming. Lena was very communicative: she gave accurate directions and, because she couldn't be there, she left an additional contact person in case I needed help. My mom and I needed a place to stay at the last minute around the holidays when things with friends fell through and Lena was very accommodating on short notice. I'm very familiar with NYC and this is a great neighbourhood (right around the corner from the outstanding ""Absolute Bagels"") and very close to public transit.

This apt would be ideal for 1-2 people on their first trip to NYC or someone just looking to stay in the city for a while. I felt at home as soon as I arrived. The building is secure and the neighbourhood is quiet. If I ever need a place to stay in NYC again, I would come here without hesitation! Thanks again Lena![QWERTY123]This was a beautiful, clean apartment in a great neighborhood!  Couldn’t have asked for a better experience.  Thanks Lena![QWERTY123]The apt was just as pictured, beautiful, clean and in a great neighborhood.
Lena was very communicative and welcoming, she gave accurate directions and even cared to offer suggestions regarding places to visit.
I highly recommend this place! Thanks Lena![QWERTY123]My wife and I went for a very short break to NY and we rented Lena department. From the first minute we arrived at the apartment we were pretty happy. The place looked as it was specified in the information available on the web. Lena is a very nice girl and inspires a lot of confidence. On arrival at the apartment, she gave us important details about the site and some recommendations to better enjoy our visit. The department has everything a visitor needs, and above all is very tidy and clean. The doorman of the building is very friendly. The area is fairly quiet and very close to two subway stations, which is important to organize trips into the downtown area. We strongly recommend to anyone who wants to visit NY stay in the department of Lena. At least that's what I hope to do when you return to NY .. Thanks for everything .. You are fantastic Lena[QWERTY123]I was here for work for a week and this apartment was great!  It was very clean and in a great neighborhood. It has an elevator which is somewhat rare in Manhattan and very much appreciated!  The apartment was very clean and Lena (the host) was very communicative and helpful (she even gave me cake)!  I would rent here again.[QWERTY123]Léna est une hôte prévenante et réactive, même n'étant pas présente lors de notre arrivée elle s'est assurée que tout se passait au mieux pour nous!
L'appartement est propre et conforme aux photos,  le quartier est agréable, et l'accès très facile aux lignes de métro qui  amènent rapidement vers le sud de Manhattan (20 minutes maxi de métro de la plupart des endroits touristiques). A recommander sans hésiter !

Lena is a thoughtful and responsive host, even not being present when we arrived she made sure everything was going well for us! 
The apartment is clean and exactly like on photos, neighborhood is nice, very easy access to subway lines that quickly lead to the south of Manhattan (maximum 20minutes from most touristic places). Definitely recommended! Thanks again for everything Lena!
[QWERTY123]The apartment was very nice, cozy and clean, close to subway and central park.  We haven't met the host but we were in touch through e-mail. She was very nice and friendly. 
Only little minus was the noise from the street.[QWERTY123]To say it in one word: AWSEOME!!!
The apartment is located in a very nice area of New York. Central Park is so near, you could almost jump in from the window. There are a lot of trendy bars and restaurants in close vicinity.
The rooms are really as shown in the pictures and very clean. The bedroom has an air conditioner which is pretty cool in the hot nights. The bathroom is a little jewel in blue with a great shower (which I loved to use). We didn't used the kitchen but it looked also clean and very functional. 
Lena wasn't there but she gave us a lot of informations and recommendations. She always was very helpful and answered potential questions very quickly. I definitely would book again.[QWERTY123]Lena, was very helpful throughout. Her directions and house rules were straightforward and easy to understand. Overall a great experience at her apartment, just right for a couple nights in the upper west side.[QWERTY123]Lena's apartment was great for my short New Years retreat. Although I did not meet her, Lena was very helpful and easy to communicate with! She answered all of my questions in a clear and timely manner. The apartment was tidy and just as pictured. The immediate area has stores with everything you'd ever need as a traveler. Apartment is also subway/bus accessible - take advantage of it! And for fans of Seinfeld, Tom's Restaurant is only a few blocks away. Enjoyed my stay, thanks Lena![QWERTY123]The apartment was as described and very clean and tidy. The location was fantastic and extremely close to the subway. Lena was more than available to answer questions and accommodate us; her doorman and other apartment associates were pleasant and welcoming. I would definitely stay again.[QWERTY123]Lena was a terrific host, and her apartment is in a great location on the upper west side.  It is convenient and spacious for a NYC apartment, and worked well for our long weekend stay.[QWERTY123]Great space and great location. Lena was very helpful and communicative and made sure we had all the information we needed.[QWERTY123]Lenas place is quite simply an ideal place to stay for a visit in NYC. And Lena herself is an ideal host - prompt, friendly, and caring of her guests.[QWERTY123]Great apartment, awesome location away from the touristy parts giving you an amazing authentic New York experience. Great value, 1 block away from major subway stop making the city easy to navigate. Close to the Northern part of Central Park. Lena was great at communicating with us and answering all of our questions immediately. Would stay here again.[QWERTY123]Great location.[QWERTY123]Lena is a very thoughtful and attentive host.  I needed for nothing during my stay.[QWERTY123]Lena has a great taste in music and arts.  Although I have never met her in person, her apartment is full of pictures and good equipment.  When we entered into her apartment, we found no surprise!  What you see on the website, it's truly what you will get.  She has a guitar, good microwave, and good speakers.  Although I play a guitar, i do not touch it. We personally do not leave any fingerprints on those equipment because we value her space.  It's also my promise to her that I will keep her apartment clean.  On the first day when we arrived, I asked my son not to touch anything of the shelf.   I also feel obliged to clean her kitchen and floor.  I think she appreciated it because she mentioned the kitchen was spotless (Website hidden by Airbnb) am happy to stay in her place and thank her for sharing her space.  We would definitely go back to her apartment when we visit New York.  Thanks Lena.   (also she responded my inquiries quickly, just like what other said).[QWERTY123]Good experience, an option to be taken seriously, really pleased with my choice, strategic location, very convenient self checkin and checkout,
Lena is available and attentiv, conexión wifi ok

Una bella esperienza, consiglio la casa di Lena, ben ubicata e servita, buon segnale internet.[QWERTY123]Awesome place next to Central Park and Lena is really friendly. Loved it[QWERTY123]è stato tutto carino e comodo[QWERTY123]This a perfect place! Perfect location  (Upper West side a block from Harlem), perfect size (comfy 1 bedroom with gorgeous tile bath and small but well appointed combined living room and kitchen), perfect host (clear and fast communication). Thank you![QWERTY123]Great place.  Great location 
Super Host.

28	17747	"George and Lily are a terrific host and hostess.  They provided a warm and inviting atmosphere where we were made to feel right at home.  If travels allow, we know we will stay there again.[QWERTY123]George and Lily are very gracious.  They are helpful if you have questions about the area.  The room and private bath are excellent.  Easy access to the building and apartment, also street parking in neighborhood.[QWERTY123]George and Lily were very nice and flexible for our late check-in. The room, bathroom and apartment are super clean, well decorated and very quiet. George gave us the best recommendations for breakfast in Fort Greene. If you don't know much about Brooklyn Food, he is the man to ask!
Overall a great place to stay for a weekend![QWERTY123]Due to a little mishap in booking, we did not get to stay with George and Lilly, but George was very gracious in helping us find alternate lodging in his area of the city, which he did not have to do.  We look forward to staying at their place should the need arise in the future.[QWERTY123]I stayed 2 and a half weeks with George and Lily and had an amazing time. The apartment is beautiful and the bed oh so comfy. Clinton Hill is a pretty part of brooklyn and the C train is on the same block which is super handy. George was extremely helpful with transport and directions for getting to certain places in manhattan - and recommending some top spots to eat and drink nearby - which were spot on! George and Lily made my stay in NYC a beautiful experience and I will most definately be calling on them again next time I'm in NYC. Thanks G&L for a top time! I miss you already!!![QWERTY123]Great accomodation and marvelous host.
All good!.
I will stay again with George on my next visit to Brooklyn.[QWERTY123]George was a great host. He was very helpful and thoughtful. I enjoyed my stay in this room. I slept well - I wouldn't hesitate to stay there again.  I particularly enjoyed exploring this neighbourhood. I just wished I had more time in this part of NYC.[QWERTY123]George is an excellent host! The house is clean, the room is big and bright with plenty of shelf space, you get your own bathroom (a dream) and you're in a great neighbourhood with a subway stop at the corner. Highly recommended.[QWERTY123]We enjoyed the room and the location - very comfortable and convenient! Olea (restaurant) was a great recommendation from George. Would come back again.[QWERTY123]The apartment is nice and in a good location.

However, the bedroom door didn't lock.  This might not be a thing for others, but I'm a woman traveling alone.[QWERTY123]This apartment is a jewel, and George too! 
The area has lot's of cool restaurants and cafés - and don't miss the Brooklyn Flea at weekends![QWERTY123]For me it was the first time I used airbnb. I really enjoyed staying in George's apartment. it's clean and nicely decorating. I like it.[QWERTY123]George hosted my parents on their latest trek to Brooklyn. While their real mission was to visit with their grandbaby a couple of neighborhoods to the south, George was a great ambassador for the nabe and offered suggestions for dining as well as a clean, quiet, and well-appointed place (including a private bathroom--a real selling point for my parents) for them to stay. The only drawback for us was the subway situation, because of work that weekend on both the C and G lines (out of anyone's control, obviously) and the notorious difficulty of getting between neighborhoods in the outer boroughs if you're not on the same line to Manhattan (ditto). For someone wanting to visit Manhattan and some of Brooklyn's trendier neighborhoods, though, the location would be perfect.[QWERTY123]George was great. I felt comfortable at his place he is very helpful and knowledge about the city he made me feel right at home.  Thanks George![QWERTY123]It was my first timing using Air BNB and it was a wonderful experience. George and his family were wonderful host. The location was central to the train and to great dining. It was my first Brooklyn experience and will not be my last.[QWERTY123]I had three wonderful days at George place in Brooklyn. George is great host, arriving late was no problem. Thanks for the good recommendation for breakfast. Both Olea and also the bakery in Lafayette Ave where great and close by. 

It was my first time in NY, so my focus was on the tourist sights in Manhattan. Taking the C train (local train) it will take you about 30 min to get  to Time Square. But if you have time try to get out at High St and walk the Brooklyn Bridge.  

It did not manage to see MoMa and found out that Brooklyn also had many places which needs to be discovered. So I guess there will be a next time.[QWERTY123]George has a stylish apt in the heart of Brooklyn. Great views of Manhattan. George was a cordial and unobtrusive host who made us feel very welcome.[QWERTY123]The apartment is great and George is a perfect host--helpful but unassuming.  The apartment is lovely, clean and bright, with nice views.  Location is great, a block from the A/C trains to Manhattan.  There are excellent restaurants within a few blocks.  A well-stocked market, and a laundromat are within two blocks.  We intend to stay there again.[QWERTY123]We stayed a couple nights and George is an excellent host!!  He was very chill and gave us recommendations for places to eat around the area.  He made us feel at home and the space was amazing - clean and comfortable in every way!  We loved the hardwood floors and the eclectic decorations. 

The location is superb and a few blocks to the train.  There are a few late-night spots a couple blocks away which can be fantastic after a night out..

Further, George made us tea and we had a great time chatting before we had to head out.  

Overall, I highly recommend Blue Trim Guest House and can't wait to go back![QWERTY123]My stay at The Blue Trim Guest House felt like Home. George is a gracious host who treats his guests like family. The space is gorgeous - bright, clean, modern, well-appointed - and the neighborhood will make you fall in love with Brooklyn and New York.[QWERTY123]George was a perfect host, nice and helpful. The appartment is exactly as described and though it is a bit far from Manhattan if you're using public transports, it feels like luxury to find such good accomodation in NYC.[QWERTY123]I'm a Blue Trim regular and fan club member. George is terrific and so is his space. You'll rest easy as his guest. 

[QWERTY123]What a fabulous introduction to New York and first time AIRBnB’r!  Blue Trim Guest House is everything I could have hoped for; a super stylish apartment on the 6th floor with views across the city.  Comfy bed in a room with loads of natural light and space for my belongings, private bathroom, tidy, safe and secure.  Close to subway, shops, loads of restaurants, laundry.  George’s hospitality also exceeding expectations with info and generosity.   Highly recommend.[QWERTY123]Our stay @ Blue Trim Guest House was wonderful and there is not enough we can say. The location was perfect, the room cozy ,clean and very quiet and has private bathroom. George was simply amazing. He made us feel welcome and gave us all the advice to enjoy at the fullest the city.
We recommend this guest room for whoever wants to discover NYC in New York style.[QWERTY123]George is warm, generous host with a home that reflects those qualities. When I overbooked my own place around the corner and needed a place for a close friend, George took care of him.  His apartment is stunning and tranquil, not to mention being in the best neighborhood on the planet.  I can't speak more highly of the competition![QWERTY123]We had a wonderful time at Georges place. He's an inspiring and  magnificent host with lots of great recommendations. Thanks to him all our days began at a cosy little bakery (serving the worlds best oatmeal -try it!) and most of them ended at one of the neighbourhoods many small - but high quality - restaurants. In between it was very easy to reach the rest of NY City as the subway is only a block away. Therefore I can highly recommend George and his room to everyone searching for a place to stay in this nice area.[QWERTY123]This is a beautiful sunlit appartment with beautiful, sunlit occupants. We had a warm and comfortable stay here. George and Ben are delightful and the room was very pleasant. This is the best of many good Air BNB experiences.[QWERTY123]Very accommodating host allowed reservation less than 24 hours in advance.  
Room was perfect with promised private bath.  
Never met until I was leaving; a perfect host situation since I am familiar with Brooklyn.[QWERTY123]At heart I identify as a Hawaiian-New Yorker.  Blue-Trim - the space,  it's people -  embodies the Aloha-Brooklyn Spirit.  You will love and feel loved here.[QWERTY123]George's place was a very nice charming apartment.  It was very close to the subway line and therefore convenient to access.  
I would stay here again when visiting NYC.[QWERTY123]George's place is an oasis! It's peaceful, fun, joyful and he is a treasure! This is my second stay here, and if it wasn't for my purchasing my own place around the corner, I'd always stay with him. He's become a friend.[QWERTY123]My husband and I just returned from our visit to the Blue Trim Guest House - our first trip with our nearly 5 month old son and our first experience with Airbnb - and our stay could not have been better. We arrived midafternoon after a long day of travel, and George welcomed us warmly into his home. The space was bright and airy and had an incredibly calming vibe, providing a perfect respite from the pace of the city. Our room was cozy and quiet, with a comfortable bed and beautiful morning light. 

The location, too, was perfect for our needs. We arrived by Amtrak at Penn Station, and took the C train right to BTGH (the Clinton-Washington station is at the end of the block); as for other transit options, the Clinton-Washington G train is an easy 10 minute walk away, the B25 bus to DUMBO and the gorgeous Brooklyn Bridge/Fulton Ferry Park picks up just around the corner, and the Atlantic Avenue Terminal (with LIRR access, as well as several subway lines) was a pleasant 15 minute walk away.  

George was a wonderful host, and we really enjoyed chatting with him over a glass of wine in the evening and over our morning tea. We had a terrific experience at BTGH, and would happily stay there again on a future visit to NYC, or recommend it to friends.[QWERTY123]This is a great spot if you have business in Brooklyn or need to get into Manhattan because the A and C train are right outside the door.  But,  you don't have to go too far for a great coffee and french pastry around the corner.  George was a wonderful host, accomodations are veyr private and the views from his windows are great!  We'lll be going back again in the spring![QWERTY123]I spent a week at George's place, and it was a delight. Not only is his apartment spaceous, tidy and tastefully arranged, but George is a great human being, with a grasping, tolerant and colourful mind. And none the less a delicate sense of humour. I will definitely be back![QWERTY123]What a warm and welcoming place to stay. This was my first airbnb experience and it exceeded all expectations. George is an engaging, helpful and mindful host and human being. I had an amazing four days getting to know Brooklyn, but Manhattan was easy to get to. Definitely book your stay at the BTGH![QWERTY123]I was coming to New York to photograph the largest rooftop solar array in North America in New Jersey. I expected to get some good photos, meet some some good folks and come home with a few good stories. What I returned with was more than I could ever put it into words and at the top of that list is a new friend in George Del Barrio.  Thank you George! 
All my best...
Woody Welch, 
father/photographer/coach/teacher/friend[QWERTY123]It was my first visit to the US. And it was just perfect to be at George's! It was so nice, we really enjoyed out stay!! Thank you soo much, again! I would absolutely recommend this place! And, make sure you visit this place by fullmoon :([QWERTY123]Blue Trim is an ideal AirBnb experience: a beautiful, sun-filled apartment, a comfy bedroom, your own bathroom, and a very friendly, helpful host. The C line is very close by, and Clinton Hill / Fort Greene are great neighborhoods to explore. George was very accommodating and generous, and we recommend his recommendations - by that I mean, we found out about some great places because we took his advice.[QWERTY123]George ist ein angenehmer Gastgeber. Seine Wohnung ist sehr gut zu erreichen und gewährleistet einen angenehmen Aufenthalt.
Alles was man in NY sehen  muss kann man sehr gut innerhalb kürzester Anfahrtszeit erreichen. Jederzeit wieder![QWERTY123]George was a very nice host. Without him, I would have never met my new friend V.
The apartment is well located, it's big and its lovely!
The bed was a bit too soft, but I would say, this is a very personal impression and some like it like this!
I would totally recommend him as a host for NYC!!
It was my first trip and it was more than I expected!

Thank you George for V!

[QWERTY123]Beautiful room in a safe area, close to the C-line. George is a very dedicated host, always eager to share wine, meals, advice and time.[QWERTY123]George was a delightful host and thought of everything. Very cool place.[QWERTY123]To the world community!
If ever you find yourself in Brooklyn and need an exceptionally clean, comfortable and convenient place to stay with a totally chill host who really knows all the great places to eat and enjoy, then look no further.
George is charming and pleasant and respectful of your privacy. He knows the area very well and always was spot on with the recommendations.[QWERTY123]I can't recommend staying with George enough. New York can be discovered by various means - by staying at Blue Trim you will have easy access to subway stations which are within walking distance, so touring the city can be done with relative ease. The other way to discover New York is to spend time talking to a native. G. is a native with a creative spirit that is both kind and welcoming. The apartment itself is beautiful, in large part down to G.'s eye for the aesthetic. You will find yourself smiling when discovering gentle reminders of the host's humanity in the most unexpected of places. In addition, the apartment's view of New York's skyline is breathtaking. If you are the type of person who itches at the thought of spending time in a sterile hotel room then I highly recommend you spend your time at Blue Trim. George - thank you for everything.






[QWERTY123]George, you are ACE!! even at 2pm in the morn, you were as calm as the beautiful NYC breeze in the summer. Thanks so much for taking me my son and my hubbie into your wonderful eclectic home. We love you and your welcome in Reyjavik anytime!! xxxx[QWERTY123]I don't think there's much I can add to the long list of glowing reviews already present. The apartment is perfectly located (minutes away from two subway stations), clean and quiet, and lovely decorated (had to keep my paws off the plethora of old cameras... sigh!).

Much more importantly though is the interaction with George. He took the time off to welcome me personally -- while hours away from a deadline. Tons of tips, an introduction to a terrific coffee shop.. in short, it never felt like staying at a BnB, but visiting a friend's place. Highly recommended.[QWERTY123]All were beautiful.
Also atmosphere of the room and a house, and green and rows of houses of the town.
Especially  I  was touched by the beauty of George's heart , and I thought that I was fortunate.
When I went back home I became rest, but when George was, warmth was able to be felt more.
Thank you for the great time.
I would like to have some wonderful moment in the house of George again.
[QWERTY123]Blue Trim Guest House is like a Paradise, Not only because the space, the house,the room, the decoration, the ambience, the good feelings, the neigborhood and others.... The most precious think that it has is the Host!! George is great and he always opens his heart for you!!... Thanx George for this 3 weeks, I will never forget U.....[QWERTY123]Fine, Intelligent, thorough, careful and responsible fellah. Treats people with respect and makes you feel at home. Highly recommended.[QWERTY123]The reservation was canceled 31 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.[QWERTY123]The reservation was canceled 14 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.[QWERTY123]The Blue Trim Guest House was a such a treat to stay at! 
Warm, inviting and full of light - it was a perfect space in the perfect location. Close to subways and a plethora of cafes/eateries I couldn't have asked for more in Brooklyn..
George is full of helpful hints and recommendations - a truly gracious host  who made me feel most welcome.
Staying at Blue Trim was a dream - a home away from home![QWERTY123]Truly great experience, George and Emily are a very friendly and respectable couple and I absolutely enjoyed my stay, it felt like home.
Got introduced to tasty Babka and loved the conversations over drinks.
This beautiful unit is located in an authentic neighborhood in Brooklyn and easily accessible by subway. 
Highly recommend this place.[QWERTY123]The apartment is perfectly clean and comfortable, in addition to being located in a terrific neighborhood full of greenery and shops. It is a short 15 minute ride into Manhattan and the train stop is just down the street on the same block. I had an amazing stay and George & Emily were wonderful, gracious hosts. And both are terrific cooks! The experience was above and beyond what I expected, and I felt very much at home. We had meals, beers and wine together over the course of my stay, and each was an experience that I won't forget soon. If you get a chance to stay at their place, please don't hesitate! Thank you again George & Emily! Hope we see each other again soon![QWERTY123]George and Emily were such relaxing and gracious hosts! They're obviously experienced in hosting others, and the room was so nicely situated for staying for a longer period of time- dedicated space for clothing etc made us feel right at home. Fingers crossed that this room will be available again next time we are in town.[QWERTY123]First time using Airbnb and my experience with George and Emily was really great. Apartment was really clean and it's located in one of the best neighborhoods in Brooklyn. Subway C is only a block away.[QWERTY123]Loved the apartment closed to good food and and transportation[QWERTY123]George and Emily are beyond wonderful. They were excellent hosts: gave clear direction, made themselves available when we needed it, and gave us our space (not that we wanted any.. loved hanging out with them!). They're all-around fun, interesting, friendly, lovely humans. 

The apartment is clean, spacious, quiet, and nice to lounge around in. The room has AC, a fan, and a private bathroom right across the hall. It's a block away from the subway and very close to some really great food and bar options.

Thanks for everything, George and Emily! I hope we meet again. :)[QWERTY123]A great experience. George is a friendly, welcoming, and accompdating host, and the apartment is clean and comfortable. It’s also in the perfect location for exploring Brooklyn.[QWERTY123]とても快適に過ごすことができました｡地下鉄の駅に近く､夜も人通りが多くて安全で便利な場所にあります｡お部屋は清潔でｲﾝﾃﾘｱも可愛らしく､ﾎｽﾄのGeorgeとEmilyはとても親切でした｡また利用したいです｡[QWERTY123]George’s apartment couldn’t be better located! He was a lovely host (we didn’t see too much of him because they left for the weekend), but he didn’t mind me working from their awesome dining room table, even when he was working from home too. He was totally accommodating and it’s a perfect set up for Airbnb.[QWERTY123]Had a great long-term stay with George and Emily. Recently moved to the city for a new job and couldn’t have asked for a better experience while getting settled in at work and finding a place of my own. George and Emily are great hosts and their home is clean, comfortable and conveniently located next to public transportation in a lovely area.[QWERTY123]George is a fantastic host and his apartment is a fabulous space.  The bedroom we rented was spacious with a very comfortable bed, and the shared spaces are well-appointed.  George was extremely quick to respond to all messages and questions, and accommodating in all aspects of our stay.  I highly recommend George's place for anyone looking for a quality Brooklyn experience![QWERTY123]An absolutely wonderful place to stay in Brooklyn and you couldn’t ask for better hosts and a better spot. George & Emily are fantastic hosts who are easy to talk to, full of great recommendations, attentive, and respectful of their guests. Whether my wife & I needed to duck in and out for a quick stop or wanted to sit and enjoy a cup of coffee at the kitchen table, it feels like staying with good friends.

The space itself is clean, bright, quiet and the bed is super comfy. (I probably had my best night’s sleep in over a year during our stay.) The bathroom is located right across from the bedroom and the kitchen had everything we needed to prep a light breakfast before heading out for the day. They have an espresso machine but after George recommended the amazing Beny’s Delice bakery around the corner we would just walk there to grab coffee (and a croissant or three).

The location is great whether you are planning to just be in Brooklyn or travel into Manhattan. You can walk a block to the A/C train and be in Times Square in ~30 minutes (we were in town for a theatre show), or walk a couple blocks to the G train and hit up most of the Brooklyn neighborhoods. If you like to walk it’s the perfect spot for that too. We walked to both Prospect Park and Brooklyn Bridge Park from the apartment to enjoy some warm Spring weather.

Thank you Emily & George for a fabulous trip.[QWERTY123]It was perfect!
warm hospitality, very clean, great location, etc.

I recommend you George's house.[QWERTY123]If you need a great location, clean space, and a gracious host look no further.  Very relaxing and comfortable environment.  

The windows do not face the street so the noise level is very low.  Easy to get around and George goes out of his way to make sure you have what you need.[QWERTY123]The room was very clean and comfortable, and very convenient to the bathroom.   George was very friendly and an excellent host, very quick to respond to any questions I had.  The location worked out very well for me.  I would definitely return.[QWERTY123]George was an amazing host! He made me feel right at home as soon as I arrived. The location was great and you’re able to get to Manhattan via train (on the same block) or you may walk to other parts of Brooklyn, if you’re up for the exercise. I felt safe at all times and even with only being there for a weekend, the locals greeted me the next day during my walk. Everyone in the area kind of makes you feel like you’re visiting extended family. 

The room was true to the pictures on Airbnb, the shower pressure was relaxing, the picturesque view from the common area is classic and the bed was super comfortable! I literally couldn’t have asked for a better spot for a weekend visit. I also had the pleasure of meeting Emily and she was the sweetest (she even recommended a couple of nail salons in the area after me simply stating I wanted to get mine done)! On my first night, we sat in the living room and talked like old friends. I admit, I wasn’t sure what to expect but now I can only hope George’s room is available for my next visit! 

Thank you George & Emily![QWERTY123]George was just gorgeous. He and his family were so wonderful and made our first trip to NYC to an amazing experience. Without his great recommendations we wouldn't have seen so many nice and cool places. We came as strangers but left as friends. Every time again. Thank you very much for everything.[QWERTY123]I really enjoyed staying at George’s. He is so welcoming and warm as a host and made me feel right at home instantly.  As an added bonus the bed was so comfortable that I slept like a log which is unusual for me. Also, access to Manhattan is super easy with a train nearby. Highly recommended.[QWERTY123]George and Emily have a beautiful home in a fantastic location, but that’s just the beginning. They’re also excellent hosts. They took time to get to know us and made a point to hangout with us. We had a phenomenal time. I would highly recommend staying at their place. It’s clean, comfortable and welcoming.[QWERTY123]George's home is amazing!! George and Em were super welcoming and it was a great neighborhood to stay in. They provided helpful suggestions of coffee shops and alternate routes to navigate Brooklyn. Em and George took time to bond with me and made my stay extremely pleasant. The pictures and description don't do justice to warm reception you'll receive staying at their home. I can't wait to stay again!![QWERTY123]The only regret I have is that I didn't get a chance to meet George and his family when we stayed as they were out of town. Beautiful home, sparkling clean and full of style and ambiance. The neighborhood is nice, with a lot of eateries and stores in short walking distance. Perfect for our visit to Brooklyn![QWERTY123]Amazing! I was so lucky to find this gem! George and Emily are great hosts, they made me feel at home from the moment I walked in. Apartment is spotless clean, the guest room is furnished with everything needed, there are plenty of clean towels and linen. Location is very convenient and close to subway station. 

I am definitely staying here again next time I’m in town.[QWERTY123]Absolutely perfect! George’s attention to detail along with a very convenient location made my stay an absolute pleasure.[QWERTY123]Quedarse en lo de Emily y George fue una excelente experiencia! Los dos son muy amables, el dormitorio es muy cómodo, el departamento está a una cuadra del subte, bien equipado y tienen todo impecable. Definitivamente los recomiendo!![QWERTY123]George is very kind person. He gave me lot of tips regarding city. Place was very clear, room was gorgeous.[QWERTY123]George is genuinely a good person and you don’t find that very easy! Very happy with all he has done. Would definitely recommend![QWERTY123]George is a fantastic host. The space is thoughtfully curated and very clean. The room is well equipped. I had everything I needed and more. The location is perfect; right in the middle of Brooklyn. All this combined with a very reasonable price adds up to incredible value. I will definitely looks this place up again in the future. I couldn’t recommend it more highly.[QWERTY123]Nice clean room  in a great Brooklyn location.  Full amenities.[QWERTY123]George and Emily are amazing hosts.  They are extremely personable and have a lovely home and make you feel very welcome.  The location was perfect for my needs as well as close to the subway and plenty of wonderful places to eat.  The view from their home is awesome as well.  They will definitely be our go-to place in NYC![QWERTY123]It was the second time I stayed with George and Emily and and everything was perfect. Love this place[QWERTY123]George is a great host.[QWERTY123]George's place was exactly as described. It's located in a safe neighborhood between JFK and Manhattan with easy access to the C-line subway station. The room was extremely clean and well-maintained as well. As other reviews have mentioned, George is also a genuinely good person and was an awesome host. He provided numerous recommendations throughout my stay and responded quickly to any questions I had right from the start. Overall, staying at George's place was a great experience. Don't hesitate to book here, you won't regret it![QWERTY123]The apartment has an ideal locale. Super close to both transit and great neighborhoods to explore. I knew very little about Clinton Hill or Ft. Greene and had fallen in love with both by the end of my stay. George was attentive and made everything super hospitable. I would definitely stay again![QWERTY123]Such a welcoming apartment in a prime location. Clean room, great WiFi, and such hospitable hosts. I felt like one of the family.[QWERTY123]George is one of the kindest persons that I have met. He was very accommodating with my check-in time even though my flight suffered multiple delays into the wee hours of the morning. The room was exactly as described and in sparkling clean condition. The location is perfect, lots of excellent cafes nearby and nearby subway stops are well connected. Thank you for a wonderful stay, George![QWERTY123]Perfect![QWERTY123]This is another host 100% satisfied. Staying at George has been an awesome experience. Not only the entire apartment was immaculate and exactly as described, but (and here is the plus thing) George is a wonderful person, always ready to make your stay perfect. George is also a excellent conversationalist (even he had a pretty busy schedule he always found a moment to interact with me) and most of all he is a good hearted man. I’ll miss those chats with a glass of whiskey. Thank you for everything you did, man. 100% recommended. Don’t miss the opportunity to stay at the blue trim house!!![QWERTY123]Great location in Brooklyn -- less than a 5 minute walk from the subway (A and C lines) and many restaurants, bars, cafes. George and Emily were such gracious, kind hosts. They even invited me to an art opening they were hosting the day I arrived. Their place is immaculately clean and very tastefully decorated -- after a long day in the city, it's nice to come back to somewhere that feels like a real home rather than a sterile hotel room. The room itself was cozy, the bed luxurious, and the closet space/shelving ample. I would definitely stay here again."	40.68346274904446	-73.9637353238205	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/17747	2	105.0	0.814286

We plan to return again. Thanks, Laurie![QWERTY123]Great place to stay - lovely home, lovely hosts and great neighbourhood - glad we got to spend some time in Brooklyn[QWERTY123]Great place, great garden, friendly cats and nice host.[QWERTY123]Booked this on behalf of my daughter so didnt stay there myself. My daughter confirmed the house was not as clean as expected but Laurie was in the middle of having some work done on the house. Only stayed for two of the four nights booked as circumstances changed.  Lauried very kindly gave refund for one of the nights not used.[QWERTY123]It was the first time we used BB and not the last...for my daughter seda and me,it was ideal to live in laurie's typical brooklyn house during 10 day's. We recieved interessting informations about cultural happenings and practical things. Laurie is a friendly open person.
her house is locatet in a charming part of brooklyn and very close to a metrostation..[QWERTY123]We enjoyed a lot our stay with Laurie. Great and qiet house with its  garden and  two lovely cats. Laurie was  helpful, gave us good and interesting advices, and permitted us to discover another view of Brooklyn. Thanks Laurie![QWERTY123]There are some beers in the fridge said Laurie at the end of our phone call. This is a sentence one might expect when calling home. And not of a stranger calling from Manhattan to Brooklyn to state the time of arrival.
I'd rather not use the hackneyed phrase. A home away from home.
But I will anyhow. Laurie's little house in a ""Starbuck-free-zone"" in Park Slope Brooklyn. An area just like a cliché-laden European would imagine. Her house, full of books,  pictures. The splendid guest room. Most impressive of all, however is Laurie and her son, Peter. Generous, friendly and helpful. Laurie gave me some good tips. E.g. BAM, Barke-Music, Gospel concert. And when I come back to Brooklyn again, I know there will be a beer for me in the fridge.

Dieter, D. Germany[QWERTY123]We stayed only a few days but it was above our expectations. Laurie is a great Host and a gold mine of infos about Brooklyn and NYC also. Her place is quiet, clean and well located. We strongly recommend it, you'll feel a little a bit like home. 
Laurie we got a super deal for a brand new Krups' toaster-oven at 80$ at Richards.
Best regards to you and Peter.
Jean-Claude and Suzelle from Montreal.[QWERTY123]Laurie was a very gracious hostess and we felt right at home.  She is very knowledgable about the local community and the city overall and full of good ideas about activities in the area.  The house itself is beautiful and clean with two friendly cats and of course Peter too.  The location is great, close to Manhattan but walking distance to good bars and restaurants in Brooklyn too.  We wouldn't hesitate to stay there again.  Thank you![QWERTY123]WHAT CAN I SAY...
LAURIE IS AN EXCELLENT HOSTESS...
THE HOUSE I S VERY WELL LOCATED,,,,
EVERY THING SEEMS TO BE CLOSE... 
THE HOUSE IS REALLY BEAUTIFULL...
THE ART IS MAGNIFICENT...
THE GARDEN IS GORGEOUS...
SHE AND PETER WERE SUPER KIND AND HELPFULL...
WE REALLY FELT AT HOME...AND WERE SORRY FOR SUCHA SHORT STAY...
SURE WOULD RECOMEND IT TO EVERY BODY.. AND WOULD LIKE TO RETURN...
SHE MADE OUR SHORT STAY... PRECIOUS..[QWERTY123]My husband and I had a wonderful time with Laurie and another guest at her welcoming home.  We were thrilled with the location - only blocks from our daughter and close to the train!  Spending time chatting with Laurie and her family in her warm living area enhanced our trip.[QWERTY123]Dear Laurie, thank you so much again for amazing time in NY! We are deeply in love with warm atmosphere in your home, our room was perfect, cosy and great comfortable beds!!! Great location near Subway, 15 min to Manhatten!! We really felt like home, and can't imagine better place to stay next time!!:) Hope to come back soon! Natalia[QWERTY123]A huge thank you to Laurie for 'being there' with so much advice and info on local restaurants, places to visit and for welcoming my daughter Rebecca too (she lives in NY). We felt so relaxed and comfortable it was like being at home. The house is a dream and an inspiration in Art and Style. We will be back and have all ready recommended it to our friends. Janet & Les Ross.[QWERTY123]Laurie is a great hostess who loves to share her beautiful home.  She makes great coffee and offers wonderful pastry for breakfast while sharing her discount tickets for broadway shows.[QWERTY123]Laurie's available room was simple, clean and comfortable. She is a hostess who knows Brooklyn and how to get around. I enjoyed my stay although breakfast was lacking.[QWERTY123]Thanks so much for a memorable Brooklyn experience, Laurie and Peter.  The bed was super comfortable and everything you could possibly need was provided.  The house is located in a quiet street which was a nice contrast to the crowds and ambience of Manhattan.  Park Slope is home to so many great restaurants and live music venues which Laurie recommended--her knowledge and passion for the local area was clearly obvious, and she was keen to make sure you got the best out of her neighborhood.  You'll immediately feel right at home.[QWERTY123]Thanks for everything Laurie. You have a lovely home. The shops on 5th Avenue are conveniently nearby & the subway lines are just a few steps away. Our room was homey & the bed was comfy.[QWERTY123]It was the second time when we stayed at Laurie’s place, and again it was so warm and cosy, wonderful soft beds, quiet district, great spacious bathroom,  we even didn’t want to go out of home!:) We really felt so relaxed and comfortable like we were at home!   
Laurie was as always very helpful and kind! 
The location is perfect, it is great, that the Subway was very close, Manhattan is just 10 minutes by Subway. It’s so warm and comfortable that we just love this place more and more!:) THANK YOU!!!!
[QWERTY123]This was the first time I ever tried this kind of accommodation, and what a pleasant experience it was. Laurie's home is beautiful and spacious. It makes you feel like you are a resident of New York, instead of a Visitor. I came to Brooklyn for a week long Workshop. The close access to the Subway, and minutes away from Manhattan was extremely convenient. I loved my room and the internet access was great. The bed was comfy and the room charming. It is a nice, quiet and safe neighborhood. I plan to come back for another Workshop this year, and I will stay with Laurie again if my room is available. Her 2 cats, Batman and Robin are adorable.[QWERTY123]We loved Laurie and her home! It was our first time using Airbnb and we were thrilled to find such an amazing place. Laurie's house is truly filled with art, color and light. Park Slope is fantastic and I will always stay there when I go to NY. Laurie and Peter are welcoming and...Laurie's breakfast is perfect!The pictures really can't tell you how amazing her home is. The rooms and beds are cozy, clean and confortable as is the bathroom. Batman and Robin are the sweetest kitties. We love them. I would recommend Laurie's bandb again and again. I hope to go back and to bring friends and family as well. FIVE STARS all the way![QWERTY123]Staying at Laurie's house was a real treat!!! We had an awesome time; it was so nice to come home to a real home every night!  Like everyone else has said; everything was clean, the beds were comfy; the breakfast was delicious; the cats were hilarious; and I would ad that Laurie's welcoming nature & willingness to share her wealth of NY knowledge with her guests was a HUGE blessing as well.  Staying with Laurie & Peter (and Batman & Robin!) made our NY experience awesome!  Thanks so much!![QWERTY123]We stayed at Laurie's place in Brooklyn for 6 nights while on our US trip. Laurie is the perfect host - she even had our baby at east within seconds of meeting her. You can grab breakfast (bagels and OJ, yum!) before leaving and her place is a short subway ride from Manhattan. Thank you again for the stay Laurie, it made our NY experience even richer.

Gabby, Mench and Julian[QWERTY123]We had a great time staying at Laurie's house. It was really quiet and comfortable for sleeping, easy to get to, and Laurie was really helpful with her advice. We also enjoyed the illustration artwork and books and getting to know Laurie's neighbors and neighborhood. This was my first time using Airbnb and it all went seamlessly! I hope we can stay with Laurie again on a future trip to NYC.[QWERTY123]Le séjour passé chez Laurie Kellogg  fut vraiment très agréable. Laurie est charmante, attentionnée et s'occupe très bien de ses hôtes. Les chambres sont très confortables, spacieuses, bien décorées, avec une touche très personnelle qui donne cette impression d'être chez soi. Le petit déjeuner, pris dans le salon principal est toujours très copieux et bien équilibré (à volonté, bagles &cream cheese, fruits, céréales, jus d'orange bio, lait, etc...); Après avoir marché pendant des heures dans NY, nous avions accès à la cusine pour préparer un repas, et ensuite nous prélasser dans le salon. Le quartier est particulièrement attrayant à quelques minutes de Prospect park (profiter de la fraicheur du matin pour aller faire un petit jogging) des rues calmes, des restos sympas, des clubs de musique, et beaucoup d'infos de la part de Laurie pour que le séjour laisse un souvenir inoubliable.
Last but not least, nous n'avons pas eu de surprises désagréables par rapport à ce que nous avions espéré en voyant le site de Laurie sur Air B&B, et nous recommandons cette adresse les yeux fermés.[QWERTY123]This was our very first time with AirBnB and we loved it. Laurie's place is really comfortable, nice and quiet, with a real warm and friendly atmosphere; we definitely felt like being at home. Laurie has been really helpful, with lot of tips about places to go and restaurants to dine in the neighbourhood; her house is within easy reach from the nearest metro station, and just a few subway stops from Manhattan. Laurie is an open-minded, talkative nice woman, we really loved chatting with her and we would have had more time to spend with her. Hope to come back soon![QWERTY123]We had a wonderful time in Brooklyn with Laurie (Peter was away at camp).  We had the top floor to ourselves during most of our week-long stay.  Laurie provided plenty of ideas of things to do.  The location was ideal.  We walked down to the DUMBO area a couple of times, easily took the subway into Manhattan, and attended an outdoor concert in Brooklyn's Prospect Park, which we would not have learned about had we been in a hotel.  There are numerous restaurants nearby, both eat-in and take out, as well as several grocery stores/delis.  We ate many meals in the park, enjoying the warm weather.  Laurie was very generous with the use of her computers, which was very helpful in allowing my daughter to keep up with her friends on (Hidden by Airbnb) , and even to connect up with them in New York.    We would definitely contact Laurie again if visiting New York.[QWERTY123]We spent wonderful days thanks in her lovely home, we felt very
well the rooms were comfortable as the whole house. We appreciate a lot
the warm athmosfere that she created, she also helped us with
suggestions, buying tickes for us and so on.
New York City is wonderful
and Laurie helped us to live it in the best way.Thank you a lot!

Abbiamo trascorso dei giorni meravigliosi nella sua bellissima casa. Ci
siamo sentiti accolti stupendamente, le camere erano confortevoli come
tutta la casa. Abbiamo apprezzato tantissimo la calda atmosfera che ha
creato, ci ha inoltre aiutato tanto con suggerimenti, acquisto
biglietti e tanti utili consigli. New York è una città meravigliosa e
Laurie ci ha aiutato a viverla nel modo migliore. Grazie davvero![QWERTY123]My 79-year-old parents recently stayed at Laurie's for a few weeks (with a break to go to DC for 3 nights, during which their luggage was graciously stored) and they loved the place. They were in New York to visit grandchildren in Park Slope, and the house is conveniently situated near bus and subway lines. It was very clean, homely and Laurie was most obliging and welcoming, providing anything they desired (Weetabix, bedside lamps, fruit salad!) upon request.[QWERTY123]We enjoyed our stay with Laurie and Peter. Great location. Laurie was very welcoming and we felt at home straight away. She gave great help on visiting the area. There were a couple of samll things that needed fixing like the front door and the bedroom door which does not shut easily but I'm sure Laurie is on to it! Thanks L[QWERTY123]What a find... we had a great stay with Laurie.  What a gem... would never hesitate to recommend  her to any one.  What a place, what a deal and what a site... Thanks to airbnb I was able to enjoy Brooklyn and Manhattan.  Her house is so close to the sub way, but Brooklyn is a must see place too.  Thank you soo  much!  Your son and cats just add to the experience.  The Australia couple are now friends.  I will be back.  Heather[QWERTY123]We stayed 5 nights in Laurie and Peter's home and cam't imagine a more comfortable accommodation in Brooklyn.  Laurie is quite involved in her community and she loves Brooklyn.  She took us to Red Hook to me some of her artist friends and gave us a bit of a tour around the area.  She obviously loves her neighborhood.  I would recommend this home to anyone.  Thanks Laurie and Peter.[QWERTY123]It was my first time to use such kind of accommodation instead of hotels and I liked it very much. Laurie's house is amazing, the room is cozy and quiet, the bed is comfortable, everything is very clean and has really warm atmosphere, breakfast is very good and the cats are sweet. The location is very quiet and convenient, 5 minutes walking to subway - and in 15-20 min you are in Manhattan! NYC is great, worth visiting again and again, and Park Slope is the best place to stay. Laurie is a great host, very helpful, very clever and with good sence of humor. I enjoyed my staying with Laurie and definitely will come back.
Highly recommended to everybody.[QWERTY123]Laurie was so kind, and an excellent host! She made us feel entirely welcome in her beautiful home. Clean, cozy, super-convenient location in a nice neighborhood. Plus, an impressive library of children's books:)  Would love to stay there again.  Thank you so much, Laurie!![QWERTY123]Staying with Laurie and Peter was an absolutely wonderful experience. I felt like it was a second home. The room had great morning light, the house is peppered with beautiful illustrations and there are books galore. What more could you ask for?! I felt so welcome and taken care of by way of recommendations for restaurants, cool places to see and things to do.  I would one-hundred percent recommend staying with them. I can honestly say that I not only had a great time but I have  made two wonderful friends. Thank you so much Peter & Laurie! :-)

[QWERTY123]Un buon posto dove soggiornare per brevi periodi a New York se siete in compagnia di altri con cui condividere la vostra camera (anche se foste da soli dovreste pagare la camera per intero, a quel punto trovereste qualcosa anche a Manhattan, se le vostre intenzioni sono quelle di visitare questa zona della citta'). Laurie ed il figlio sono davvero ospitali (Batman e Robin due micioni in cerca di coccole), la casa e' a completa disposizione dell'ospite... il frigo e' sempre ben rifornito di succhi, latte e quant'altro possa necessitare per una buona abbondante colazione. Si raggiunge il centro di Manhattan in circa 25 min di metro, la fermata piu vicina alla casa di Laurie dista appena 5 minuti a piedi. in definitiva l'esperienza a casa di Laurie e' stata sicuramente positiva.
Diego[QWERTY123]that was really cool! from the first minute in the house u gonna feel  like u came to see some of your far away relatives. Laurie was super nice host. She told us a lot about the places to visit and to eat at (really good ones) and what to do during our stay. Oh, and there are s (Phone number hidden by Airbnb) charming cats) 
The room was clean and warm, the bed was comfortable and the bathroom right by side had everything u need.
Next time in new york i'll stau there for sure :)
p.s. the house is really that beautiful as in pictures)[QWERTY123]We had a fantastic time at Laurie's. The house is beautiful, the cats adorable and the room very cozy and comfortable. Laurie herself is a wonderful person, as well as a great source of information: her knowledge of Brooklyn and NYC in general is impressive! Also, the house's location itself is very convenient, be it for the subway station or just shops and good restaurants. We strongly recommend staying here - it is well worth it - and we're sure you'll enjoy it as much as we have.[QWERTY123]Laurie is a warm and generous host .  Her recommendations of restaurants in the neighborhood  have been memorable. Her home in the South Slopes shows many original and personal artwork, and lots of children's books.  It is within easy walking access to the subway.[QWERTY123]Laurie was a great host! She was very friendly and very helpful with dining and entertainment recommendations, even offering groupons for us to use! It was nice of her to have breakfast items available. The room was spacious and the location was great for exploring Brooklyn as well as Manhattan (very close to the F/G/R trains). This was my first airbnb experience and it was definitely a good one![QWERTY123]Laurie is a generous host who imparts info about Park Slope restaurants, provides terrific bagels and orange juice, cereal, etc. and shares her wonderful, spacious home with interesting travelers who get to know one another. Her quiet neighborhood in Brooklyn is ideal for exploring Prospect Park, 7th Avenue hotspots, and close to subways for getting to Manhattan in a short time. Check out the TKTS site at the Jay Street/Metrotech stop to get 50% off Broadway tickets. Much less crowded than the Times Square location. I also recommend trying the Moutarde Bistro at 239 5th Ave about a mile north of Laurie's for a great French meal at reasonable prices. All in all, a great place to stay.[QWERTY123]nice rooms,  clean, warm and cosy.   Nice Bathroom with very hot shower.   top floor,  could be difficult stairs for elderley to negotiate.[QWERTY123]It certainly was lovely to stay in Laurie's house. Staying in Brooklin was no disadvantage at all, quite quickly to Manhattan by subway and having the oppotunity to see sites in Brookling we would not have seen otherwise. Laurie is a wonderful hostess, very helpful, interested in art and very educated too.
Nearby are a few really nice restaurants, which we eventually preferred to places in Manhattan, cheaper and good quality.
We thoroughly enjoyed our stay.
Linde and Peter[QWERTY123]My daughter and I stayed in Laurie's house for a few nights. It was quite perfect. an. Extremely well-organized (Website hidden by Airbnb) a quiet neighbourhood, close to the F train, straight into Manhattan.[QWERTY123]Laurie's home in Brooklyn is fab - great location with lots going on in the local area and easy access into the city to do all the tourist sights! We were sad not to meet Laurie and Peter, but enjoyed staying with a lovely Swiss couple in the house. Thanks to Laurie for all the extra tips and finishing touches she added to the experience! Definitely recommend to others.[QWERTY123]Laurie was a wealth of information and offered many great tips about Brooklyn and New York. My daughter and I enjoyed staying in her cosy home, and walking the neighborhood.  By the time we left, we felt like locals using the subway and enjoying all that the city has to offer. We'd definitely recommend a stay at Laurie's in Brooklyn, as both a way to stretch your travel dollar and also as having a fabulous location to explore. 

Being in Brooklyn didn't prevent us from attending theatre in New York, going to museums or visiting Central Park.
[QWERTY123]Laurie is a great host. Tons of maps, books and information available for her guests to help plan their NYC trips. Also, her location in brooklyn is fabulous--walking distance to5th and 7th avenues in brooklyn where lots of cool indie shops and cafes are located and only a few blocks tot he metro to get into manhattan. Loved her croissants in the morning.[QWERTY123]Laurie is an awesome hostess: great breakfast carbs with espresso; lots of suggestions on places to go and things to do; and the best English-style garden I've seen lately.  Clearly posted instructions available for things like tricky doors, cats, coffee machine & so forth -- all intended to help you be the good guest she deserves.  I'll be back![QWERTY123]Staying with Laurie was fantastic.  We felt so at home.  Laurie makes you feel really relaxed, the house is lovely, the cats (Batman and Robin) are cute and we slept so well.  Laurie gave us lots of ideas about where to eat and things to do.  Breakfast was lovely with great products.  We want to go back to New York because it's a great city but also because we want to stay with Laurie.  We don't hesitate to recommend her to you!  Also, Park Slope is a great area and you are so quick to get to manhattan.  One of the best b and bs we have ever stayed in.  Thank you![QWERTY123]Our stay at Laurie's is probably the best experience one could ever imagine through Airbnb.  Laurie is an amazing host, a knowledgeable tour guide of New York, and a museum curator all in one.  Her home is in a great part of the city, yet on a side street where I never had a problem parking just a few feet from her front door.  Her house could be a Better Homes and Garden showpiece, and yes, it even has a large garden in her back yard.  There is artwork and books everywhere.  In fact, the photos on Airbnb don't even do justice to the beauty of the place.  The rooms are large, immaculate, and the beds are comfortable.  The espresso maker in the kitchen and fresh croissants and OJ every morning was a treat, and much better than even Starbucks can deliver!  The house management team, Batman and Robin (Laurie's two cats), were friendly and ever-present.  I couldn't think of a nicer place to stay.[QWERTY123]hello,
just to let you know that we stayed at Lauries place and that was a great experience! 
she's a wonderful host, and we had a very good time.  
Laurie helped us to figure out what we should see and do in Ny and her house was a place of rest and safety when we came back from the hectic NYC :-)
Brooklyn is beautiful too and only about 10 min. with the metro to the city centre.
If we ever go back to NYC, we'll ask Laurie to stay at her home again, her house felt like home the moment we came there! 
Also Lauries son Peter was a perfect host, nice boy!!! 
We sent them our love because they helped to make our vacation feel like one great gift!! 
geert and marjan from Belgium[QWERTY123]What a wonderful happy house! My friend and I stayed with Laurie when we came to do the tunnel to tower charity run and Laurie couldn't of helped us more. GREAT coffee!!![QWERTY123]A fantastic few days in New York, made perfect by Lauries accommodation. A great location in Brooklyn, near so many lovely cafes and restaurants and a very short walk to the subway. Laurie is so full of excellent information and there to assist with any questions and needs.[QWERTY123]It was great to stay at Laurie´s. Her house is magical, full of art and small details , and very comfortable . She was the most hellpfull and available host ! I really enjoyed staying at her place !
 I highly recommend to book with her,.
 Park Slope it´s really a safe place to be and a very nice neighbourhood to know!
Something else  , I left NY very late at night and Laurie allowed me to leave my baggage at her house until the time I took the cab !!!!! That was a very sensitive attitude and I really appreciated it ( and she did it even though her new guests were already arrived !!![QWERTY123]We had a great time at Laurie and Peter's house. We were made to feel really welcome with our young daughter and Laurie went out of her way to share tips and ideas for places to visit. Our room was really comfortable and it was great to be surrounded by such fantastic art. It was really useful  to have access to lots of maps, magazines and information about New York, and we really enjoyed our chats with Laurie- it was great to meet someone so passionate about her city.The neighbourhood is fantastic- we ended up enjoying Brooklyn so much that we spent most of our time exploring the local area. We really appreciated the hospitality which we received and we are delighted that it made Tove's first trip to NYC so special. Thank you- and we hope it is not long before we return.[QWERTY123]Our stay was excellent! The house is great and Laurie very welcoming![QWERTY123]This was a perfect location for getting around Brooklyn. I loved the ease of walking, catching a bus or car service.
Being in Laurie's Home is to be surrounded by art work and books. Her warmth makes you feel right at home.[QWERTY123]We had the best stay with Laurie possible.
She is very hospitable & knowledgeable

The house is beautiful & the bedrooms are extremely comfortable.

The subway is just five minutes walk with trains to Manhattan every few minutes.
Brooklyn  itself is great to walk around with lots of good food & quirky shops.
Went to a small music club round the corner (Barbes) and saw Nora Jones performing also a fantastic Mandingo embassadors - guinean band. Top stuff![QWERTY123]My partner and I stayed with Laurie for 5 days right before Christmas, and we couldn't imagine a better choice for our New York visit. The house is located in a wonderful, safe and pedestrian-friendly neighbourhood in Brooklyn -- with a great choice of restaurants, cafes and bars, all within short walking distance. There are also two easily accessible subway stations nearby for getting around the city. As a result, we had no problems efficiently getting around Brooklyn and Manhattan from this location.  

Laurie herself was an excellent host, and a fantastic source of information for where to go for dining and entertainment, as well as for  getting around New York and Brooklyn. She also appeared to know quite a bit about the historical and cultural side of the city. (One of my regrets was not getting enough time to talk to her about this side of the city)  

The house itself is a walk-up with beautiful spacious interior (the photos on the website don't exaggerate). The house is filled with a wonderful array of art -- in fact, one of my daily pleasures was lingering over the drawings and paintings as I walked up and down the stairs in the morning. 

The room we had was cozy, warm and private, and the bathroom was clean and maintained throughout our stay. In short, we couldn't hoped for a safer, more well-kept place for our visit. 

My partner and I were surprised as to how much we lucked out finding this place for our New York trip, given that this was the first time we had used Airbnb.  We intend on coming back here again when we visit N.Y. next time.

[QWERTY123]I've been in NY for New Year Eve with my boyfriend. Our stay was perfect, Laurie's place is just next to the metro wich is fine if you want to visit Manhattan, but is also a cosy place to come back to after an intense day in the city. The room and the breakfast were fine, and Laurie has been a very good host explaining us how to move with public transportation. We had also the opportunity to experience the everyday life of Brooklyn wich is something more than just being tourists in Manhattan. And if you love cats you should meet Batman and Robin![QWERTY123]I had a most enjoyable stay.  The building is close to public transportation and a short walk to several great bars and restaurants.  The Fifth Estate was the best  with live entertainment every night. The hostess always had coffee, juice and snacks available.  The two resident cats added great enjoyment to my visit.  Highly recommended.
Pat Brennan[QWERTY123]If I could give Laurie more than five stars, I would.  My family will be eternally grateful for her amazing warm hospitality to my daughter Dana  who needed a place to stay for two weeks between apartment changes. I'm  writing the review since Dana is in move- in mode today, but she could not have been more thrilled with her stay. We  met Laurie after a six hour drive from upstate to assist in the apartment search, and she was kind and lovely. This was my first introduction to airbnb, and find it hard to believe you will find any nicer stay than this one!!! Amazing area, lovely and clean house....but mostly, just a warm feeling environment. 
Thank you Laurie.[QWERTY123]Laurie and her comfy home were a perfect place for me while working in Brooklyn.  The accommodations were quiet, homey, and clean, she always offered help regarding things to do and places to dine and there were 2 super duper sweet kitties to round out the experience.  :)
So enjoy!  

Adrienne[QWERTY123]My wife  Pat and I had a 10 day stay in March and it was a most enjoyable experience. The house is remarkably 'homely' and conveniently placed in Park Slope to  great shops, restaurants, amenities and services. Laurie is a superb host helpful, attentive and  and very kind. The house has style and is very  comfortable but with some stairs  to climb that need good legs. But the effort is more than made up for by the pleasant surprises in store for the European visitor in particular, and the engaging conversations  to be had with Laurie and her brother Colin. Warmly recommended!
--Manlio 

This was such an incredibly lucky find.  A large old house full of charm, very comfortable and the bed was like drifting on a cloud - seriously!
This old world experience included the wonderful hospitality and friendliness of Laurie (the B&B owner and host) who is a veritable mine of information regarding places to go, how to get there and much time is saved by recommending places to eat. Talking of food, oh those almond croissants!  Many thanks to you and your son for a great stay. Your two lovely cats, Batman and Robin, also made us feel very much at home! We will definitely be back Laurie.
--Pat

Manlio and Pat Guidetti from London , England[QWERTY123]Laurie was just brilliant. It felt like staying with an old friend. Laurie is so very helpful and caring about what she does. Her hospitality started way before my friend and I arrived with her friendly emails, giving us advice about how best to travel to her home from the airport, and about money off vouchers for bike rental in Central Park. We arrived at her home really late, and Laurie and her brother Colin were there to welcome us with a glass of wine, and Colin even took our huge cases up the stairs. Laurie lent my friend a coat whilst we were staying- as it was colder than we had expected. I visited New York partly as a tourist, but also to visit my daughter who is studying over there. Laurie was so kind in allowing my daughter to stay over one night. We slept in Peters room, which was great. That meant so much to me as it meant my daughter and I could be together late at night. Staying in Peter's room also meant that it was ok for Robin and Batman- Laurie's lovely cats- to snuggle up with me, just like my cat at home does. However, it was also no problem to keep the cats out of our room if we wanted to.
My friend and I shared the room on the top floor which was a lovely light room at the front of the house and shared the bathroom with Colin- which was never a problem. The bed was comfy, and Laurie provided towels, boxes of tissues- and there was even a hairdryer. The shower was just great. 
One morning Laurie cooked us breakfast- and again it was just like being a friend sitting up at the breakfast bar watching her cook bacon and French toast. Other mornings we chose to wander up the road, as we found a little local cafe that we enjoyed going to. The area was perfect after hectic days out walking in the city- we often came back quite late, and it always seemed safe, quiet and calm.
I would have no hesitation in recommending a stay with Laurie. Much more friendly than staying in an impersonal hotel room. I hope that I will return, and also hope that I keep in contact with Laurie. Both Laurie and Colin have a great sense of humour.
Two regrets- that we didnt go to the bar on Sunday night to listen to music- we were too tired.- And that I didnt take any photos of Laurie, Colin and her cats.-Oh!! and a third regret!! We didnt really get to know Laurie's son Peter- he wasnt around much.[QWERTY123]Laurie is a great host and her house is lovely. We have stayed in Manhattan for all our previous visits to New York, so it was a new and refreshing experience to hear birds singing when waking up in the mornings!

Park Slope is a really nice area and Laurie's house is just off 5th Ave which has plenty of nice places to eat and drink. It is close to 2 subway stops that give you easy access to other areas of Brooklyn, plus Manhattan and Queens. (About 20 minutes from Lower Manhattan). 

The breakfast was good too - Laurie put on breads, croissants and jams, plus a coffee maker and made it clear that you are to make yourself at home. 

The rate as extremely reasonable and allowed us to spend more time in New York than we could if we had stayed solely in Manhattan. 

I would definitely stay here again and would recommend[QWERTY123]We've just returned from another stay with Laurie in Park Slope. This was our third visit in all but the first since 2009 and it felt like returning home! Laurie's place is the perfect retreat in the big city - quiet, comfortable and homey, we'd never consider staying anywhere else.  As always Laurie was the perfect host - armed with a wealth of information on restaurants, museums and other activities to keep us busy. In fact, more like a friend that a host, conversation was always interesting and fun. The bagels and croissants provided each morning were the perfect start to the day, not to mention the excellent coffee. It was also great to see the adorable resident cats - Batman and Robin - once again. The neighbourhood has changed a little since our last visit but only in a positive way - there are now even more fantastic restaurants and bars to try out and many are right on the doorstep. Park Slope really is the perfect base to sample all of what Brooklyn has to offer and apparently there is a small island called Manhattan not too far away if you run out of things to do![QWERTY123]Lovely, comfortable home in quiet neighborhood. We had a great time!  The cats are very friendly too.[QWERTY123]Laurie's home is the perfect way to begin your trip to the city. It is beautiful and exactly as photographed. The garden is amazing and the proximity to the subway makes it an awesome choice. Laurie is a supremely gracious host, with fantastic advice. The neighborhood is filled with great places to eat and drink. I can not wait for my next big apple adventure and would stay here with out question.[QWERTY123]We had a room in Laurie's house, and it worked well for us: close to subway lines-20 minutes to Downtown Manhatten, easy access to rest of Brooklyn. Our room was clean and quiet, with tree lined view of street below. Thank you Laurie for your friendliness and generosity. We would definately stay there again. Doug and Candace Loskutoff[QWERTY123]We had a really nice time in Brooklyn. Laurie Kellogg is a magnificent host. She gives a lot of tips and useful advice about things to see & do, good restaurants, bars, subway schedules, ... We stayed in a room with double bed on the top floor: a quiet place to sleep. It's a house with a history... lots of books, pictures and drawings. A bit messy but really cosy. We felt at home immediately. Laurie can also provide breakfast if needed: organic orange juice, croissants & fruits. We enjoyed it a lot! Thanks Laurie for such a wonderful stay!
[QWERTY123]Second time to stay with lovely Laurie, Peter and the feline boys in her wonderful home. Extremely comfortable and relaxing, especially after full days in the city. We took both rooms on the top floor so that the girls (both 18) could come and go and it worked beautifully. Highly recommend.[QWERTY123]Staying at Laurie's beautiful, warm, friendly and inviting home made our stay in New York so much more personal and fun! It gave us more a feeling of living there as opposed to just visiting.  Laurie could not have been more helpful in offering suggestions for things to do and directions for getting places. Within such a short time I felt I had made a new friend and knew I would be welcomed back in the future. Thanks again Laurie for your gracious hospitality. All the best to you always. Cheryl[QWERTY123]My sister and I stayed at Laurie's place for a week, and we had a very good time there. The house is beautiful and welcoming (and so is the lovely garden/ backyard). We stayed in the room with the two twin beds and we shared a bathroom with another guest, which worked out very well. 
Laurie was a very welcoming and helpful host who provided us with lots of insider tips, maps, vouchers, and just very useful information on what to do, where to go, and how to save money on Broadway tickets, etc. 
Not only were we delighted by the house and our host, we can also recommend this place because of its great location. Park Slope is a very lively neighborhood with a variety of restaurants, bars, cafés, small  shops, trees and beautiful houses. Last but not least, this place can be easily reached by subway and we never felt unsafe walking home (""away  from home"").[QWERTY123]The star rating says it all.   The location is excellent , close to the subway station.  Laurie is a great host, very helpful.[QWERTY123]Laurie provided useful maps and gave nice tips about NY. She recommended good restaurants and interesting places to visit. I had a wonderful time in NY.[QWERTY123]We spent two wonderful weeks at Laurie's. She and her son Peter are very nice and warm people. Her house is in a nice neighborhood and quite close to the subway. She had a lot of information about restaurants, interesting places and things to do in Brooklyn. Her home is beautiful, full of art everywhere. The room was big, comfortable, we had all we need. I'll miss the espressos in the morning. I'd love to go again, thank you Laurie![QWERTY123]Laurie est une hôtesse fabuleuse et cultivée parle bien français en plus de tout le reste.  Elle nous accueille avec beaucoup de tendresse dans sa très belle maison, nous avons passés un séjour excellent, grâce aux conseils précieux pour circuler, pour prendre un verre, pour aller écouter de la musique à Harlem, moment de pure émotion. Un petit déjeuner complet et du vrai café expresso, la chambre impeccable dans un décor de très bon goût. De toute évidence Laurie et Peter ont contribué à notre bien-être dans cette ville magique.
De plus une chambre très calme dans un environnement sécurisant en plein dans Brooklyn.
Nous quittons Laurie et Peter à regret et merci encore pour votre merveilleux  accueil.
Almitra et Xavier[QWERTY123]Ca a été un bonheur de passer une semaine chez Laurie, superbe maison, petits dejeuners bio offerts succulents. Une maison calme, propre, très proche du metro pour aller à Manhattan. Laurie s'occupe de vous comme le ferait une maman, une adresse fortement conseillée si vous êtes de passage à Brooklyn. I miss Laurie's house ![QWERTY123]I spent few days with Laurie and her family at her beautiful house in Brooklyn, it was really a good location, near public transport and interesting bars, stores and restaurants. 
She is a true art lover, and you are going to feel home if you stay there. 

Gracias Laurie por toda tu buena fe, espero nos volvamos a ver pronto. 
Muy recomendable. 
[QWERTY123]Laurie was really great with us. She gave us a lot of information on places and things to visit. Things we would probably never have done without her advices.
The house is really beautiful and cosy. You defintely feel at home !
Celine[QWERTY123]We had a great time in Brooklyn using the rooms at the top of Laurie's lovely Park Slope house. We are a family of four (two adults and two children) and needed to stay in this neighborhood so were very happy to find this place. When we got there we were made very welcome. The rooms are a good size and it was great to have our own bathroom (which also has a washing machine and dryer which we used once). Breakfasts were delicious--fruit, croissants, bagels, cereal etc. The house is close to lots of great restaurants and shops, and Laurie provides lots of information about things to do, including maps, menus, and recommendations for exhibitions. This was my first time using Airbnb and it worked out very well.[QWERTY123]Fantastic stay, yet again. I wouldn't want to stay anywhere else in NYC. Wonderful hosts in Laurie and Peter, beautiful house, really great location for exploring both Brooklyn and Manhattan. I have to stop now before I run out of adjectives, so will just say that I'm very much looking forward to the next visit.[QWERTY123]Me and my daughter stayed for 5 days and we enjoyed every minute. Laurie is a wonderful host, she gave us very useful advices. Her house is charming, the neighbourhood very pleasant with nice restaurants and bars. You need 20 minutes to got to Midtown Manhattan with the F-Train. But what we liked most was the inspiring conversation with Laurie and the other guests.[QWERTY123]Laurie's home is charming and she is an excellent host. The apartment is located near the subway and walkable to many nice restaurants in Park Slope.[QWERTY123]Laurie was an excellent host. She knows really nice spots in Brooklyn and Manhattan. She was very helpful when we needed information about the city.

Her place is beautiful, near the metro and near from really cool restaurants and bars. Beds were very confortable! 

And breakfast was delicious![QWERTY123]Laurie is much more than a host, but a dedicated friend who makes almost everything for the guests to feel welcome. She gave us many nice tips about places to go (the Mermaid Parade, for example, that was unforgettable!). The house is located in a safe neighborhood, (lots of trees and birds), five minutes by walking to subway. I recommend her home for everyone who wants more than just a place to sleep while visiting New York city, but a house full of art, who offers a real experience of life.[QWERTY123]Laurie's place was perfect for my stay - I was visiting my young daughter who lives in Park Slope, and Laurie's house is at the dead centre of the neighbourhood, well placed for the subway and slightly south of the rather uber-trendy Slope further North.
We had, when at home, the run of the thru lounge and garden. Other people staying were great company. Well stocked fridge etc. Cats good company too...
Laurie very welcoming and easygoing and treated the three loud toddlers wandering her lounge with care and kindness.
Not ideal if you want to be alone, and unless you are in the basement flat you are sharing a bathroom, but these are minor issues and the place is great value.[QWERTY123]Park Slope is an amazing neighborhood to stay in, so much so that I moved here with my family from Ireland. We stayed with Laurie for a couple of weeks while we looked for a long term apartment and would highly recommend staying in the large bedroom which we lodged in for the last few nights of our stay with Laurie (in addition to the stay we had in the basement apartment).

There is plenty of space in the room which means you can store pltny of luggage and still have space to move around. There is also a bathroom on each floor so there was never any queues to get in!  Laurie provides a selection of great local foods for breakfast and guests have access to the backyard which was great for my young son as was the washer and dryer for laundry.
Laurie provided a wealth of helpful advice, was very easy going, friendly, welcoming and very accommodating and flexible to suit her guests which made a real difference to our stay. Laurie’s two cats are also very friendly and love meeting new people.
I would highly recommended booking a stay with Laurie if you would like to visit the area.[QWERTY123]This was my second stay at Laurie's in one of the third floor bedrooms. The bedroom overlooked her beautiful back garden, was spacious, comfortable, and quiet. My daughter lives five blocks away, so Laurie's is very convenient for me. I felt safe walking ""home"" to Laurie's in the evenings. I liked being able to enjoy coffee and breakfast each morning. Laurie always asks what kind of breakfast foods you like, and they ""magically"" show up on the table ready for you to partake of. Laurie and her son are friendly, helpful, and so accommodating. Her rates are very reasonable too! There is a well-stocked 24 hr. grocery store a half block away, and other types of stores, restaurants etc. a short distance away. I look forward to my next visit to Brooklyn and a stay at Laurie's.[QWERTY123]We had a great time at Lauries beautiful Park Slope house with wonderful garden, packed with squirrels. We loved the atmosphere of both house, street and neighbourhood and thus learned a lot more about New York then the usual Manhattan, really a great experience.

Laurie was a perfect and thoughtfull host from the moment of reservation, providing lots of useful information and tips for worthwhile addresses and restaurants. Perfect was also the travel info which made us travel quickly from Park Slope to lots of interesting places in Dumbo, Williamsburg (market/shops), Meatpacking (High Line) and Harlem, and don't forget Brooklyn Museum!

Furthermore Laurie made us really feel at home with daily a perfect breakfast. We surely will be back, thanks for a lovely stay Laurie. Harm and Petra.[QWERTY123]Although we haven't extensively used airbnb in the past, we have to admit that this was a surprisingly great experience for us.

We arrived at Laurie's around 11.30pm and not only she wasn't bothered by the late time, she also spent the next hour and a half to explain and discuss with us all the things we could do in NY.

Her information was spot on and we never regretting following her recommendations. She has a great taste for theatrical plays and is very well informed with what is going on in the town.

The place itself is located in a lovely and safe street only 3 blocks from the subway station that can take you to Manhattan in no more than 20-25 minutes. Art is overflowing in the place and Laurie is happy to explain where everything comes from.

Having an uncle who has been an F1 champion as well as an autograph from Roger Federer is always a bonus!!!

Batman and Robin (her two cats) are very well behaved and add to the great experience.

Rooms (both bedrooms and common rooms) and bathrooms were very clean and tidy.

To sum up, Laurie and her lovely place contributed in having a lovely time in NY and also saved some money during the trip.

If we ever go back to NY we wouldn't look for another place to stay !!
[QWERTY123]We stayed at Laurie's place for five nights. It was our first airbnb experience & really a good choice. We spent most of our time in Manhattan but had the opportunity to explore Brooklyn during the last day thanks to Laurie's suggestions. Laurie is a great host and the place is exactly the same as in the picture. Rent her place, listen to her suggestions and enjoy NYC.[QWERTY123]My daughter and I enjoyed very much staying with Laurie, she was very helpful, lots of information on what to see, transport and mad us feel very welcome in her home[QWERTY123]We stayed at Laurie's place for 4 nights for a family gathering. I am a fellow Airbnb host and needed extra space for my visiting family. You will not find a more gorgeous home and friendlier atmosphere than at Laurie's place! The rooms are lovely and the beds very comfortable. The price is also so so reasonable. Park Slope is one of the nicest and most popular neighborhoods in all of NYC and there is so much to see and do right near by. However, if you want to go into Manhattan (you hardly need too!) Laurie's place is just a quick walk to the subway to get into Manhattan in 20 minutes! Lastly, Laurie is such a great host who makes you feel relaxed and right at home. You really can't do better than Laurie's place! But book early because she gets full fast!
[QWERTY123]Notre séjour chez Laurie a été vraiment merveilleux. Sa maison est accueillante et il fait bon vivre à Brooklyn. De plus, Laurie est une personne vraiment adorable et elle n'hésitera pas à vous conseiller pour savoir où manger les meilleurs pancakes ! Nous y retournerons sans hésiter ! Encore merci à elle ![QWERTY123]I enjoyed very much to stay at Lauries place. Nice house and friendly velcoming.
It was easy to go  into Manhattan by subway and living in Brooklyn opened your eyes for that area too.  Laurie provided us with very good tips. Thanks
[QWERTY123]We (me and my family) had a great week in Park Slope! Laurie is a great hostess. Welcoming, friendly, open, straight forward and very helpful. The rooms (we rented four rooms in total) were all nice, spacious and clean. In addition the house had a nice garden which Laurie generously let us use for a family barbecue. We spent a lot of time in Brooklyn but getting into Manhattan was no problem since the subway is only a 5 minute walk away.[QWERTY123]Wonderful neighborhood. Comfortable bed. Easy and pleasant, everyone treated  me very well. Thank you.[QWERTY123]Laurie was very sweet to offer help with my plans in New York, although we were both so busy we didn't have a lot of time to hang out, she invited me to a lovely glass of wine on my last night in her back yard balcony. I am happy she is of fan of my work! Thanks for your support Laurie![QWERTY123]Very beautiful house in a friendly neighboorhood with really good access to Manhattan and all other areas.... I was staying with Laurie for 10 days, the room was nice with a comfortable bed and air conditioning.  Laurie was very helpful with any issues I had during my stay... problems with the taxi driver, maps for New York, restaurants etc. Also she took care of my laundry, what was really nice. What is important for guests to know is that there are other guests on the same floor, so you have to share the bathroom. Laurie has a helpful son and two nice cats, so don´t be afraid of Badman and Robin (the cats), because they might jump to your bed in the middle of the night..... :) Would recommend this place![QWERTY123]We (me and my wife) had an amazing time at Laurie's place. But let me take this in three steps: the location, the house and the host. 
Laurie's place is located in a relatively quiet street between two nice avenues full of restaurants, stores, cafés and other cool stuff and it's only a few blocks (about 5 minutes walk) from the metro which goes straight to Manhattan. Super nice neighborhood. Perfect location i would say. 
The house itself was lovely. There are three floors (or four if you will, there's a basement too): the bottom floor with a living room and kitchen, the second floor with two rooms and a bathroom, and the third floor with two rooms and a bathroom as well. We stayed in one of the rooms on the third floor. It worked out great. The only thing was that the wifi didn't reach the whole way up which could be a little bit frustrating, but it worked fine in the living room/kitchen. Also the hose was clean. 
Laurie was a great host. She was so helpful from the very beginning and gave us a lot of help in different ways. She served breakfast every morning (good breakfast too!) which was nice and comfortable. She also gave some advices what to do in the city and it was very fun to just hang out with her, a really nice person. 
If you are considering renting a room, all I can say is that it worked really well for us and we had a very good time there and I can definitely recommend it![QWERTY123]Warm welcome, left suitcase in living room with no worries, had a great cup of coffee! Directions to lodging were excellent.[QWERTY123]Notre séjour d'une semaine chez Laurie a été très agréable. Nous sommes arrivés assez tard le 1 er jour mais Laurie nous a attendu . Le lendemain au petit déjeuner elle nous a donné qqs explications en français sur les visites à faire et nous a remis  les clefs de sa maison pour que nous puissions aller et venir à notre guise . Chaque matin nous nous servions dans son réfrigérateur pour préparer notre petit déjeuner et faire ""comme chez soi"". 
La maison de Laurie est située dans un quartier  très calme . Nous sommes souvent rentrés assez tard le soir sans jamais nous sentir en insécurité. Le métro est très proche du logement permettant d'accéder en 3/4 d'heure environ à Manhattan.[QWERTY123]Laurie's house is a beautiful Victorian in a vibrant and interesting neighbourhood. The beds were comfortable and the breakfast was generous. There was a bike rental place nearby and we spent an entire day exploring Brooklyn from The Brooklyn Bridge to Coney Island.[QWERTY123]Superbe séjour passé chez Laurie. Laurie est accueillante et nous a donné de précieux conseils concernant les restaurants et les événements culturels se déroulant à Manhattan et à Brooklyn. La chambre était parfaite et nous avons très bien dormi (bon matelas et chambre climatisée). Les deux chats sont adorables et attachants. Que du positif et un super séjour à New york.[QWERTY123]Had an incredible time at lauries place. Clean room and bathroom, confortable bed, great breakfast and last but not least, great company. Laurie recommended great places for us to visit with directions and even some discount groupons. Batman and Robin are friendly and we had them at our door most mornings. If you are not a cat person you will definetly be once you meet them. The only complaint we have is with the wifi signal not reaching the 3rd floor of the house, but know for fact that Laurie is working on getting it fixed.[QWERTY123]Mi esposo y yo pasamos 5 noches en casa de Laurie. Lo más importante al hacer esta reseña es que nos hemos sentido como en nuestra casa, Laurie es una mujer muy cercana que te dará toda la información que solicites. El desayuno es muy completo (café, té, chocolate, tostadas, bollería fresca, queso, zumos, etc) te lo sirves tú con total libertad. La casa tiene 4 habitaciones que estuvieronocupadas durante toda nuestra estancia, todas ellas son espaciosas y con cómodas camas. Laurie te facilita cualquier producto de aseo, como champú, gel, loción hidrantante y secador de pelo que están ahí a tu disposición. En la casa viven dos gatos, suelen estar en la planta de abajo y no molestan. 
La casa se encuentra situada en una zona muy tranquila de Brooklyn y con varias líneas de metro a dos calles de distancia que te llevan directas a Manhattan en 20 ó 25 minutos. Muy buena comunicación. 
La única pega, por decir algo, es el orden. Al tener tanta gente y Laurie trabajar no siempre está todo ordenado. Aún así durante los días que estuvimos cuando había algún cambio de huéspedes venía una chica de servicio doméstico a limpiar las habitaciones. 
Volveríamos sin dudarlo. ¡Muchas gracias por todo, Laurie![QWERTY123]Laurie was a wonderful and friendly host. She informed me on all the events, restaurant and transportation in the area. The location was perfect with easy access to Manhattan and other parts of Brooklyn. The room was very neat, tidy and clean.  Highly reccomended.[QWERTY123]Laurie is a very nice host.  Always ready to help or make you feel at home.  From the croissants served every morning to the laundry she offered to do for her guests.
The house is gorgeous, big and full of light.  The backyard is also welcoming.
The room is big with very nice linens, pillows, heating and a great desk to work or use your laptop.  (wifi does not work upstairs which is good because you must go to the living room to use it while you interact with other guests or Laurie).
The bathroom is big and clean (you'll only share with the other guest in the next door room).
The two cats are also welcoming and they don't refuse a warm human touch.
The apartment is close to everything that's essential in Park Slope.  It is 3-4 blocks away from the G, N, R and F trains.  20 minutes from Manhattan.  But... why Manhattan???  You're in Brooklyn!!  Enjoy!!!
I would definitely recommend Laurie's Listing.[QWERTY123]Laurie is a very friendly, gracious host. She checked in with me a few times to make sure everything was acceptable. The neighborhood of Park Slope is great. It has lots of restaurants and shops within short walking distance of Laurie's home. I stayed in a room on the third floor of the house. A winding staircase leads to the room, and the bath is shared with any guest who might rent the other room on the floor (in my case, the other room was only rented out for the last couple of days of my stay). The bedroom and bath were both very clean and pleasant. I did not partake in breakfast, although Laurie made sure that breakfast was available in her kitchen.[QWERTY123]Our stay with Laurie has been great. Nothing is too much trouble for her, from staying up to greet us in the first night we arrived at 2.00am in the morning, having yummy breakfast supplies waiting for us everyday, recommending great cafés and shops, even doing our washing, which was totally unexpected. 
The room was lovely, comfortable and clean with everything you need. Overall a wonderful Airbnb experience. Thank you Laurie.[QWERTY123]Great stay in Laurie's beautiful home. Laurie gave us great tips on where to eat locally and left us breakfast evey morning. The house is in a quiet neighbourhood but within easy reach of Manhattan. Thank - you Laurie!![QWERTY123]The room was located very close to the local shopping strip with many places to eat and socialise as well as being just 2 or 3 minutes walk from the subway accessing Manhattan and many other places. The room was quite large and had good storage facilities for hanging clothes, etc. The bed was extremely comfortable. The bathroom was shared but still was more than serviceable. She went out of her way to ensure that we were comfortable and provided options for things to do both in Manhattan and locally.[QWERTY123]Laurie was nice, interesting and interested in our plans.  The bed was so comfortable and the room was full of books, especially ones my daughter had read as a young reader.  The shower was strong and hot. The fellow travelers were interesting.  The house is in a safe neighborhood and just blocks from the subway.  We (60 yo mom & 23 yo daughter) walked around at night and felt safe.  Laurie gave us lots of information about nearby restaurants.  She had bagels and chocolate croissants(yum) for us each morning. She has a wonderful garden in the back.  It took us about 30-40 minutes to get to downtown NYC on the subway from her house.  It was a great vacation![QWERTY123]Dank der umfassenden Wegbeschreibung von Laurie habe ich sowohl den Weg vom JFK Flughafen zu ihrem Haus ""easy"" gefunden wie auch den Zugang zu meinem Zimmer.[QWERTY123]Laurie emailed us a helpful booklet before we arrived, giving us all of the details we would need for our stay. Her home is lovely, peaceful, and inviting. She has everything you would need there, and she was very helpful and accommodating. We fell in love with her sweet cats! We would definitely book a stay there again.[QWERTY123]I was at Laurie's place in July with a friend of mine. Staying at Laurie's B&B was great! She is very nice and helpful, always ready to give great advice to her guests. Her house is very clean (even the bathroom) and her cats are lovely. If I ever happen to be in NYC again, I will definitely choose her B&B again![QWERTY123]Laurier property is pleasant and well located with Park Slope having good connections to various subway lines. We were offered breakfast daily but late risers we usually went out for brunch. Laurie is flexible and tries to give as much advice as she can on the local area's restaurants and attractions.[QWERTY123]Laurie was a fantastic host, full of information about the neighborhood
 She went out of her way to help, particularly when I had problems with my flight. Her house is lively, vibrant and full of interesting things. A good place to stay.[QWERTY123]Nous avons passé un très bon séjour chez Laurie. La maison est superbe, très grande pour une ville comme NYC, 2 étages et un jardin (et 2 chats très mignons).

 Le quartier est très agréable, il s'agit d'une des parties les plus jolies de Brooklyn : grand parc, rues bordées d'arbres, ambiance village et beaucoup de petits cafés (essayez le Barbes et l'Union Hall), restaurants et quelques endroits pour sortir. C'est un endroit idéal si vous disposez d'un peu de temps pour visiter New-York et ne pas seulement faire Manhattan. Park Slope est très bien relié au centre, la maison est à quelques dizaines de mètres du métro (lignes F, G, R). Il faut compter entre 30 minutes et 45 minutes pour se rendre au centre de Manhattan selon les lignes, ce qui est assez court pour une ville de cette taille. Facilité d'accès aux coins à la mode de Brooklyn comme Williamsburg, Brooklyn Heights (où se trouve le Brooklyn Tabernacle pour aller écouter du gospel, moins de monde qu'à Harlem).

Laurie est une hôte discrète mais qui connaît beaucoup sur la ville et saura vous aider elle nous a donné beaucoup de bons plans sur ce qu'il y avait à faire dans la ville, notamment les concerts, les musées, les marchés. Par ailleurs, elle vous envoie un guide PDF très bien fait avec beaucoup d'adresses. Le petit-déjeuner (bagels, fromage, jus, café) est inclus, ce qui est un plus. A savoir, si les trois chambres d'invités sont remplies, il peut y avoir jusqu'à 7 personnes dans la maison, mais il y a de l'espace donc ce n'est pas gênant.

Nous sommes contents de notre voyage :)[QWERTY123]Mes parents d'environ 70 ans ont passé une semaine. Voici leur commentaire. 
Chambre style anglaise très chargée. Chambre et salle de bain propres mais tres fouilli. 
Cette semaine hôte très peu présente. 
Il faut se débrouiller seul pour le petit déjeuner. 
Maison agréable, très bien située. 
Reviendrons![QWERTY123]Laurie made me feel at home from the moment I walked in her lovely house. She is such a caring host- she even lent me one of her coats when I arrived as I wasn't prepared for the NY end of winter season!
My room was very comfortable and I felt like having all the privacy I needed during my 2 weeks stay.
I would totally recommend Laurie's place - great place in Brooklyn![QWERTY123]The room was comfortable, many books which I like, bathroom tidy and clean - cats very cute - a good experience that I would repeat.[QWERTY123]We had a very nice stay in Laurie's home. Laurie is well organized to receive her guests. We were well informed of every details beforehand. Laurie really makes every effort to make us feel at home. Her house is conveniently located near subway and plenty restaurants. Our room was quiet and cosy. We had to share the bathroom with other guests but it worked out OK. 
Overall a very nice experience.[QWERTY123]I loved the stay at Laurie's! The house is beautiful and has a very nice atmosphere. The garden in spring....just gorgeous. Laurie is a great host that arranges everything you need and is a kind and 'gezellig' (Dutch word, untranslatable...) person. Her little booklet on the house, New York and Brooklyn is a very handy guide to welcome you in the house and the city. And o yeah, the cats are very kind and cuddley too ;-)
Thanks Laurie![QWERTY123]Park Slope is my favorite neighborhood to stay... Great restaurants & cafes and easy access to subway. Laurie was very gracious and the accommodations were excellent! We enjoyed our stay and we plan come again next time we're in Brooklyn.[QWERTY123]The apartment is a bohemian hideaway! Located a couple minutes walk from the 4th av G, this place was very convenient to get to. The neighborhood is very safe, clean, and charming with lots of cute vintage shops, cafes, and restaurants. Would absolutely recommend![QWERTY123]We had a wonderful stay in Laurie's gorgeous house. The location is great as we were steps to delicious restaurants and shops. Laurie is also an amazing host providing her guests with daily breakfast (fresh bagels, croissants, a variety of cream cheeses, etc.) and a wealth of information on New York city. Thank you for making our stay extra special.

Céline and Kaylee[QWERTY123]Lovely home. Great neighborhood. Close to shops, restaurants and subway. Laurie is very helpful and friendly. Room was large with plenty of space for suitcases. Shelves inside the closet helped to keep things organized. Really appreciated having a desk in the room to work. Excellent Wifi.[QWERTY123]Staying at Laurie's quaint Brooklyn home was probably the smartest decision of my entire trip--quiet, clean, comfy, and hassle free! I arrived at an odd (early morning) hour and Laurie was still completely accommodating and welcoming. My room was at the top of two flights of narrow, very creaky stairs, but it just adds to the atmosphere of the house. Just tread lightly if you arrive home late! My bed was a super comfortable queen size and was generously given three pillows for optimal sleeping.

As far as getting around, it's a great location located in Park Slopes, less than a mile from Prospect Park and a few blocks away from two direct lines to the heart of Manhattan. Even at peak hours it never took me more than 30 minutes to get to Times Square. 

Laurie as a host was ideal; welcoming and friendly, but not overbearing or nosy. We had a pleasant conversation when I arrived and then I was left to my own devices to explore the city. If I had a question or needed a suggestion, she was on hand to give the best advice. Top quality host. Really made my vacation the relaxing breeze I needed it to be. I highly recommend giving Laurie's home a visit![QWERTY123]The house is in a good neighborhood in Brooklyn.  Laurie is a very nice host. She is effective and detailed person who would let you self use many facilities in this house. The two cats are lovely.  There is a warm and welcoming atmosphere in this house, especially with many children books - her father is a famous cartoon illustrator. We enjoyed the stay very much.[QWERTY123]What an amazing time I had at Laurie's place. It takes some time by train, however the Station is right next to her place. So, very easy to move around. Amazing room, quiet place and Laurie sure makes her best to make your NYC experience the best possible.[QWERTY123]Laurie .. awesome host! Concerned and caring. Very helpful and a beautiful house. Warm and welcoming. And the cats Batman and Robin...a darling! It was wonderful meeting some of the other guests. Great conversations, and some great cooking! Will be back soon!!! Close to the metro, markets, gym, restaurants!!!! Your own private world within NYC!!![QWERTY123]Laurie was a gracious and friendly host! I stayed for 5 nights at her home, and it was comfortable and inviting. Park Slope is also a great neighborhood with plenty of places to go and shops and restaurants. I would stay again if I needed to![QWERTY123]Laurie is a great host and the location is wonderful, not too busy and next to a lot of shops and restaurants.[QWERTY123]Laurie was a great host. She knows so much about the neighborhood that it was super easy for us to navigate around the house. She provides an amazing breakfast each morning. Never imagined I could get complimentary breakfast at an Airbnb house. I had some good and bad Airbnb experiences but Laurie's house was so so great. I would stay there again and recommend it to anyone![QWERTY123]We had a wonderful stay at Laurie's place, while visiting with our daughter who lives in Park Slope.  Sharing the bathroom was not a problem, as we found all guests using it were mindful and courteous.  We appreciated all the extra amenities that Laurie provides: a good reading light on both sides of the bed, lots of room and shelves in the closet, a first aid kit in the bathroom, shampoo, conditioner, fresh and delicious croissants, bagels, cream cheese, organic milk and OJ for breakfast. . . all yummy and plentiful.   The backyard garden was at its prime and lovely.  What a gem we found.  Thank you, Laurie, and we hope to see you again![QWERTY123]Laurie's place is really great! Close to subway (R and F ) so there's easy access into the city. It's on a quiet area in Park Slope but still close to everything the area has to offer in terms of restaurants and bars. The room is a good size and has everything anyone could need. Fair amount of closet space.  Beautiful garden.[QWERTY123]This is a great location close to lots of restaurants and stores, but also in a safe, residential neighborhood. Very clean.[QWERTY123]Una bonita casa en un barrio estupendo lleno de vida social. Bien comunicada con el metro. Gran hospitalidad. Pasamos unos días maravillosos[QWERTY123]Our stay at Laurie's was wonderful from the very beginning, with lots of local tips and a full booklet with all the information you may want/need! The house was even more beautiful than on pictures, and the room was very (by New York standards: VERY) spacious. It felt very homey and we had a great time staying there and exploring the neighborhood and going for nice dinners close by. Subway is also only a couple min walk. Breakfast provided is a good plus. The garden and indoor decoration are very nice. Tree-lined streets of Park Slope are beautiful. Laurie was an amazing host by e-mail even though she had a last minute urgency that prevented us to meet each other, but she was very responsive and helpful - thank you again![QWERTY123]Charming house, great location, spotlessly clean, good communication all was as expected.[QWERTY123]We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Laurie’s home. It is a funky, century old (if not more) house. If you want authentic Brooklyn, this is the place for you! The location is fantastic. Close to transit, shops, restaurants. The neighbourhood is safe and welcoming. The price is right as well.

Laurie is kind and generous with information, tips, resources and breakfast treats. We will definitely be back.[QWERTY123]Laurie’s place was perfect for us. Accommodations were spacious and comfortable. Having access to a kitchen was great. Her location is a few minutes from subways and close to specialty markets of South Slope. Most of all, Laurie was at hand to answer all questions, welcome us warmly, and give us an expansive printout that oriented us to everything Brooklyn. She is gracious host![QWERTY123]Laurie's house is just a fantastic landing place in Brooklyn. She offers as much or as little as a traveler would want. She provides a wealth of suggestions for local restaurants, activities and overall things to do in the area. Her house is filled with fantastic art on the walls and a real cozy space to enjoy. I wouldn't stay anywhere else when traveling to the area.[QWERTY123]Good value for the price![QWERTY123]Laurie opens her beautiful home to you relaxedly and with grace. Tons of thoughtfulness about YOUR particular stay and needs. Location couldn't be better. You'll never go hungry - gobs of great restaurants and easy walk to subway in and out of the city. The best place I've found to stay in NY![QWERTY123]Laurie's house was good to stay. Location is 2 blokcs away from the subway station. Everything was beautiful in the house. Especially I couldn't get up in the morning because the bed was perfect! I could eat everything in the freezer. You can stay with a reasonable price in BR![QWERTY123]Although this was my sixth trip to New York, my stay at Laurie’s place in Park Slope was one of the most positive experiences. When I arrived, Laurie was extremely welcoming. Her home is located on a beautiful tree-lined street, located one or two blocks (in every direction) from stores and restaurants. The 5th Avenue bus stop is one block away . And the subway was a mere three-block walk. 

I liked the fact that it was quiet, even when other guests were staying in the house. I never heard my neighbors. 

Because I was busy with work and meetings, I didn’t get to spend much time in in the place. But it was nice to come home to after a long day galavanting.[QWERTY123]Laurie ist nicht nur ein wundervoller ""superhost"", sondern auch ein besonderer Mensch. Obwohl sie sich gerade erst von einer Operation erholt, hat sie sich liebevoll um mich gekümmert. Schon am 1. Abend hat sie mir alle Tricks und Kniffe des NYC Subwaysystems erklärt. Sie ist sehr ""parkslopy"" entspannt, was gut tut. Sie kann Dir tolle Tipps geben, was Museum, Essen, Musik, Taxigebrauch etc. angeht. Außerdem kannst Du mit ihr tolle Gespräche über amerikanische Politik führen. Ihr Vater ist der berühmte Kinderbuch Autor und Maler Steven Kellogg. Das schöne 3-stöckige Haus hängt voll mit seinen Zeichnungen. Eine tolle Atmosphäre! Die Zimmer und das Bad werden professionell gereinigt. Du hast während Deines Aufenthalts dort evtl. Mitbewohner, was schön ist, aber nicht störend. Alles in allem eine tolle Möglichkeit in dem schönen Brooklyn Park Slope zu wohnen.[QWERTY123]Maison typique agréable, attention la salle de bain et les WC sont à partager.
Petit déjeuner copieux si vous aimez les bagels , en revanche prévoir de laver vos tasses et nettoyer le petit dej.
Laurie manque un peu de chaleur pour une Hôte.
Endroit pratique pour les transports, prévoir 40 mn pour rejoindre Manhattan.[QWERTY123]Laurie's place was wonderful! I was only there for a few days, but it could definitely have easily been comfortable longer term. The room's desk was good for working at, but I ended up being out in the garden most of the time since it was in full bloom this time of year. Felt like I was living in a loving home with an international heart. And on top of all that the fresh bagels, cream cheese, coffee, and laundry were as promised![QWERTY123]This is a wonderful place to stay. Park Slope is a great neighborhood.[QWERTY123]It's a reasonable size room for two people, with cozy bed and quality bedding. You don't get that in many short term visitor accommodation . The breakfast is very good, but nothing is actually ""served"". Unfortunately, there is no lounge space or kitchen possibilities other than breakfast, so you have to always eat out, which is not great in NYC because it runs up your costs of being ther big time. But, Laurie is an interesting character, with a lot of good advice, and seems she genuinely enjoys meeting new people with cool things to talk about. By NY standards, Park Slope is a very fun place to spend some days.[QWERTY123]Laurie is an amazing host. She was very accommodating and provided me with a ton of information to make my visit special![QWERTY123]Laurie's place is a real Airab&b, perfect breakfast with hot coffee,tea, good begal, juice, milk etc.are provided ; the linien is clean and soft; the bed is comfy;the books are generously displayed on the shelf (my daughter enjoyed reading them a lot); the neighborhood is safe and friednly with various eateries and supermarkets; the subway is within comfortable walking distance,etc. 
Plus, Laurie gave us many helpful suggestions about the places to see and eat. She's one of the best hosts in AirBnb I have ever met. Especially the night I arrived her home was very late, she was still waiting to meet us, and having warm conversations with us. It's not like some AirBnb, you cannot see and talk with the hosts. Laurie is always there.
I highly recommend Laurie's place for  having great experience in Brooklyn NY.[QWERTY123]Beautiful home in a fantastic neighborhood!  Laurie runs a very professional Airbnb,  Her guidebook is  amazing and the coffee here is delicious!  She is a wealth of information about the area.  The art in the house is fun too![QWERTY123]A Wonderful house with wonderful people. It was a pleasure to stay with Laurie. She has great tips what to do and beside of that she is a lovely woman we liked to talk with.[QWERTY123]You will have an excellent stay at Laurie's place.  It is a very special house.  Laurie is the best![QWERTY123]We had a fantastic stay in Lauries house in Park Slop - a very interesting nighborhood. Lauries booklet was a great help to find all the nice restaurants and cafes in the nighborhood, and she was so helpfull with advising us in how to come around and into New York. We would realy recommend Lauries house and would like to come back next year :-)[QWERTY123]Laurie wohnt in einem wunderschönen historischen Haus in Park Slope, Brooklyn. Die Lage war für uns optimal gelegen. Fahrtdauer vom JFK mit subway 1 Std. 15min. Das Gegend hat uns super gut gefallen, eine riesen Auswahl an Geschäften, Restaurants, Cafés und Dienstleistungen; alles Fuß läufig zu erreichen. Man wohnt sicher und hat eine gute Anbindung zum Subway nach Manhattan, ca. 30min nach Downtown. Wir haben tagsüber Manhattan erkundet und abends zum Essen zurück zur Park Slope, dort gibt es auch zahlreiche Bars mit Livemusik. Die Gegend um Laurie’s Airbnb ist die bessere Alternative zu Manhattan, bessere Restaurants und Cafés, günstiger und entschleunigend, weit ab von dem Massentourismus und Stress. Absolut empfehlenswert ist das Restaurant “Tambour”, excelente Qualität und Preis-Leistung top, gute Weinauswahl, die Lasagne ist ein Muss!!
Laurie ist als Gastgeberin zauberhaft, sie ist sehr hilfsbereit, mit vielen Tips und Tricks, stellt Karten und Informationen zur Verfügung im Haus, sie kennt die besten Restaurants in der Umgebung. Laurie ist sehr liebevoll und wir hatten tolle Gespräche mit ihr. Wir würden immer gerne zurückkommen!!"	40.66829025291507	-73.98779092634729	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/5803	2	89.0	0.85

I would LOVE to stay there again to my next trip to NY!
Josh is the perfect host.
Thanks again
[QWERTY123]Had an excellent experience with Josh. He responded quickly to all my questions and the entire rental process went off without a hitch, including picking up keys from his neighbor when I arrived. And he found my eyeglasses that I left behind by accident and is sending them back to me.

The apartment is on a charming street in the middle of the East Village. It is spacious by NYC standards, with a comfy living room facing the street; a quiet bedroom in back. Kitchen and bathroom are small but functional and very clean.

So whether I was planning a day of shopping and eating or just kicking back with a book on a chilly afternoon, Josh's place was ideal. 

And the neighborhood is great. With the exception of my trip up to see a show on Broadway, I spent all of my time within a mile or so of the apartment - there are countless great restaurants and bars; fantastic shopping; and a short walk to the L-train, which will connect you to all the uptown subway lines.

So, yes, great time, great apartment, great host. Thanks, Josh!

[QWERTY123]Josh is an incredible host. Always available, we spent a very pleasant stay in his apartment. The district is very pleasant, with very nice restaurants. The apartment comes with of all the comfort. Everything was tied up and very clean upon our arrival. Josh gave us a warmly welcome. We felt like at home. It is undeniable that I shall return in this apartment for my next stay to New York.

Thank you Josh ![QWERTY123]Josh was great and his apartment is very very nice. Beautiful location, great space, and great neighbours! Our first Air experience and one that means we shall definitely use it - and Josh's place when we are next in NYC - again.[QWERTY123]Our stay at Josh's apartment was absolutely perfect!!! The place is wonderful: charming, clean, spacious and warm. The neighborhood is lovely, great location! And Josh is a great host! He was so kind before arriving NY and also during our stay that we are totally thankful. We had a great time in Josh's apt and in New York as well, so we'd love to repeat the experience soon! Thank you Josh!!![QWERTY123]I really can't rate Josh, or his charming little East Village Flat, highly enough. The flat is perfectly positioned in a great neighbourhood within easy walking distance of an array of amazing East Village sounds, sights and tastes. Comfortable and tastefully decorated, it was the perfect place to unwind after a long day (or night) of exploring New York City. 

Josh himself was a delightful host - helpful, friendly, and very welcoming.

All up I'd have to say my experience with Josh and my time in his apartment were pretty much perfect, and I really hope to be able to do it all again some time soon.[QWERTY123]We had a wonderful time at Josh's apartment. He was an ideal host - friendly, accommodating and efficient. Although he was abroad during our visit, he made sure we were well looked after and called to check all was okay. The apartment is stylish and spacious, on an incredibly cool street in the East Village. We loved pretending we lived there! I have no hesitation at all in recommending Josh's apartment and can't wait for our next visit.[QWERTY123]It was so lovely to be back at Josh’s – like an incredibly cool home-from-home. And we got to meet Josh this time as well, which was great. We had a wonderful, hassle-free holiday and have already recommended his place to friends![QWERTY123]The pictures you see accurately reflect the flat that you stay in. The place is tastefully put together, with all that you need at the ready. Would not be surprised to see myself there again in the future.[QWERTY123]This apartment is exactly as it is described. It is large by New York standards and bigger than we expected. Very comfortable to spread out in  for a while. Good bathroom and very functional kitchen (though we never cooked) and very comfortable bed. It was hot while we we were there and the air conditioning kept it cool. It is 3rd floor and no elevator - common in NYC.Josh was very good to deal with and responded quickly. The location is excellent and quiet yet right near everything you might need and a 10 minute walk to the subway.
The condition of the apartment is immaculate and clean and because of this I guess Josh requires a larger than usual bond which is preferred through (Hidden by Airbnb) and which he refunds in 21 days if all is OK. That is a bit of an inconvenience because you end up out of pocket  for a month or so. I reckon it's a bit steep for the Air BNB community but nevertheless I highly recommend the apartment and would definitely stay again.
Personally I like East Village the most of the Manhattan boroughs. Neighbourly and clean and fresher air than the Upper sides. Walk to Soho, Greenwich, West Village, LES. Oh and get a bike from NY Velo on 2nd Av and ride across Williamsburg Bridge on a Saturday and see the Flea Market. Priceless on a nice day.[QWERTY123]We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Josh's flat. It looks exactly like in the photos. The flat had clearly been professionally cleaned before we arrived and everything, including the bathroom, was spotless. We used his WiFi without any problems. 
Just so you know, there isn't a TV, but that didn't bother us at all.
The East Village location was perfect. Josh is friendly, helpful and super-organised.
If we come back to New York, we would definitely stay here again. Thanks, Josh![QWERTY123]Josh's Charming East Village Flat is exactly that; stylish, comfortable and very clean. It has a perfect location with subway just a few blocks away. Right around the corner you can find great restaurants, bakeries, and grocery stores. Josh is a very helpful and attentive host. I would certainly recommend his apartment to others.[QWERTY123]Josh was an excellent host during our stay in the East Village. He was the right combination of friendly and professional - both in his demeanor and in his communication. Very prompt and accommodating. My girlfriend and I are thoroughly happy that we picked his place for our first airbnb experience.

His apartment is all about the location. Heaps of places to check out in the neighborhood. The flat itself was thoroughly clean and setup to make fantastic use of the space available. It felt much larger to live in than I was expecting. It is an older place, so it does have its quirks, but that almost adds to the experience. I would not hesitate a second to stay there again when I make it over to NYC next.[QWERTY123]Great flat in a fantastic location. We immediately felt at home. If you are a coffee fan, the coffee shop in front of the building is just divine! Subway station and all the commodities really close by. The bed is comfortable. Josh is a great host. Although we didn't see him, communication was excellent. He always replied very promptly to all my questions. His neighbor who gave us the key is a charming lady. I would definitely go back there! Thank you Josh.[QWERTY123]Josh's place was in an awesome location. Close to restaurants & the subway. The apartment was clean & a great space for our two week stay in NYC. Josh was easily contactable during our stay. We would stay here again.[QWERTY123]The apartment is indeed charming, well furnished and cozy. Josh was cooperative and extremely precise in his information guide making everything very easy to use. We particularly enjoyed the convenience of the location offering plenty of choice for food and entertainment.[QWERTY123]This place is brilliant. Gorgeous apartment exactly as shown in the photos. East Village is a trendy neighborhood to stay in and no sight is really too far away. Josh was excellent with his communication. Will definitely stay again![QWERTY123]Josh and his place are great!  The apartment is in the heart of the East Village, yet quiet and very comfortable.  Josh is a very professional, friendly, and accommodating host.  We appreciated his easy-going kindness, we felt very relaxed and happy in his lovely place.  I especially enjoyed his design style and mix of antiques and modern pieces.  Everything was as or better than expected-we enjoyed Josh’s place so much we have already booked it again for our next visit![QWERTY123]We enjoy Josh’s place and the neighborhood so much that this is the second time we have stayed with him.  Josh’s place is a stylish and comfortable apartment in the heart of the East Village.  Josh is an excellent host and made us feel at home and taken care of both times we stayed at his place.  He makes everything very easy and pleasant,  and we had great stays both times.  We highly recommend Josh’s place and would happily stay there again ourselves.[QWERTY123]We had a great stay at Josh’s place. The location was great for exploring the interesting shops of the east village and beyond (please find Bonnie Slotnicks vintage cookbook shop!). The apartment itself, like many in NY was cozy but fine for 2 people with two large suitcases. I can attest to the amazingly comfortable new bed! Def helped with the jet lag. Also not on the listing is a nespresso machine, so we picked up some pods on our way for a nice morning coffee. Communication was easy by text or email, and key pickup super simple. Thanks for hosting us Josh!"	40.72828036457991	-73.98801162083384	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/18127	2	190.0	0.8

His appartment is an aesthetic treat, very clean and superbly located.[QWERTY123]This was my first airbnb experience and it will definitely not be my last.  Such a warm welcome and great apartment looking out on to central park.  Highly recommended.[QWERTY123]Claudio's private guest room was exactly what I needed for a three day stay in NYC.  The location is fantastic - very close to both the subway and the park.  The room, bed, and bath were clean and quiet.  I would definitely recommend Claudio's place and I hope to stay there again next time I am in NYC.  This was my first time using airbnb to plan my accommodations and the experience has been great![QWERTY123]Fantastic room, very comfortable and clean bed and great location. The host was very welcoming and helpful. Highly recommended.[QWERTY123]It was very good for us to stay in Claudio's place. Its a nice neighborhood in Upper West Side. It's very close to the subway (two blocks) and in front of Central Park! Very clean, safe, comfortable, bright. Claudio is very nice and polite person! He helped us with a lot of informations. We would highly recommend this place which we will come back for sure. Thank You again Claudio![QWERTY123]My husband and I were scheduled to stay with Claudio the week of Labor Day in order to celebrate our 11th wedding anniversary.  On Aug. 18th my husband was on his way home from work on his motorcycle when a man turned in front of him.  He was admitted to the hospital.  I emailed Claudio the next day to cancel our plans and inquired about a refund.  Claudio said he couldn't refund the money but would let us come stay another date, which I appreciated.  The next day my husband unexpectedly died from his injuries.  I emailed Claudio again but did not hear back from him.

Last week I emailed airb&b.  They spoke with Claudio and he agreed to refund 50% of our deposit. I really appreciate this very much.

This morning my doorbell rang and the florist was standing there with a beautiful arrangement.  When I opened the card, it was from  airb&b.  I couldn't believe it!  This is such a great site!

My children and I will certainly use this site in the future.

Again, thanks to Claudio and airb&b!

Deborah[QWERTY123]Late review but nonetheless deserved! Stayed at Claudio's in Sept 2009 with my mother and it was a great experience. He was a great host, the room was immaculate, the flat quirky, and we had no complaints! The flat is in a great location, right next to Central Park, minutes from the Subway and safe at night. Would definitely recommend him -and I just did to a friend, which is when I realised I hadn't written this![QWERTY123]We loved NYC and we loved Claudio's place. Perfect place to stay! We can only highly reccomend it.
Thank you once again and we will be back ;-)[QWERTY123]This was my first stay using airbnb and it was a great experience.  The room was exactly what I was looking for, very welcoming and the place was beautiful and very clean. I had a wonderful first time stay in NYC and I loved being able to open the blinds and see Central Park. I highly recommend staying at Claudio's![QWERTY123]We loved the room and the location - and had no problem when it came to sharing the bathroom and kitchen with Claudio and his partner. It meant that we could enjoy New York on our limited budget.

Muriel and Neville 
October 2009[QWERTY123]We had a wonderful time in New York and were very comfortable staying with Claudio. We hardly saw him at all, and felt we could come and go with ease. We would have liked to have known ahead of time that he had a roommate. Some mornings it was difficult to share a bathroom with four people (obviously we weren't all in there at the same time!). But it was a minor inconvenience and everything else was wonderful. Very clean, very comfortable, great neighbourhood, easy walk to the subway. I would recommend staying here. If you are a light sleeper, bring a face mask and (Website hidden by Airbnb) isn't loud per se, but it is on a main street and the subway runs under the building. My husband had no problems at all, but I'm very sensitive. Thanks Claudio![QWERTY123]We had an excellent stay in NYC at Claudios. Room was just perfect for what we wanted. Room/bed very comfortable-spotlessly clean! Great location with bus/subway very close by. Always a welcomed retreat returning to the room nightly after the hectic pace of the city. Just PERECT!!! Thanks Claudio[QWERTY123]Clean place, nice bedroom, comfortable bed. Great location, safe, clean, 2 min walk from the subway station and literally in front of the Central Park. Staying at Claudios was really nice. He and Kiko were so helpfull and friendly![QWERTY123]The room and location were just perfect for our trip to New York. We felt at home and warmly welcome, and we recommend to stay there! Thanks Claudio,
Veronique and Sune[QWERTY123]I just got back from NYC, from Claudios place. I had an amazing stay! We got there, the room was very clean, the bed was confortable and even the sheets smelled like fresh laundry. it was so cozy that it felt like my own room. As for the shared bathroom, my friend and i had no problem, we never got to wait in line or anything since we always went out early morning. The towels and soaps were provided also. He even told us to use the kitchen, but didnt get to use it since we ate out all the time. Perfect location, right next to a beautiful park and easy to find! We only saw Claudio the first day and our last day :)  Thank you Claudio![QWERTY123]Thank you Claudio. Just returned from ten days staying at Claudio's place. Very good location although we didn't see Claudio often as we were busy when we did he was very helpful and accommodating. Would not hesitate to stay there again. Great place.[QWERTY123]Hi Claudio! Thanks so much again for your accomodation. Claudio's place, situated just opposite Central Park, with Columbia University not far away (cheap breakfast cafes if you wanna eat out) is perfect for visiting NYC! I really loved that place, very clean, very cosy, good bed, all fresh and clean, with fresh towels and soap. Claudio is a great guy and always helpful. I really enjoyed having found a private place where you can be totally independent and feel comfortable. hope to go back there![QWERTY123]Fantastic location, perfect and cozy room/bed,  very clean, very helpful people! Thanks a lot![QWERTY123]Great place - super clean - very nice people - very convenient access to subway. Thanks so much![QWERTY123]We stayed for 6 days. This is a great location - 1-2 blocks from subway and right next to Central Park. Cozy room and bed with a small LCD tv - very nicely furnished and super clean. Bathroom is shared but always tidy and clean; has a bathtub and soap is provided. Claudio is a great host - but we had very different schedules so didn't interact much at all. Only downside is the subway runs right next to the apartment, which is on the first floor, so the room could be really noisy at night and in the morning - consider using ear plugs if you're a light sleeper.[QWERTY123]I stayed for 3 days and had a very pleasant experience. Claudio is a very gracious host, even though we did not interact much due to our schedules. I agree with Cindy H's review -- clean room, tidy bathroom, but can be noisy at night because of the subway. Earplugs were a must for me.
[QWERTY123]My friend and I just got back from a few days in NY staying at Claudio's place. The location is perfect, right opposite Central Park and a short walk from a subway station. The room was very clean and pleasantly furnished - lovely firm bed, adequate cupboard space, TV and broadband connection. The bed linen and towels were pristine and Claudio wanted to change them after 3 days! The whole flat was very clean with plenty of hot (Website hidden by Airbnb) is very bijou for 2 guests, the host and his partner. We hardly saw Claudio as we were out during the day and keep out of the bathroom early as they had work to get to. The only real neagtive was the noise from the subway which passes just inder this ground floor bedroom window. It was very loud and I forgot to take earplugs.This was our first experience of airbnb and was very postive. Muita obrigada Clauido[QWERTY123]We enjoyed our 12 nights stay at Claudio’s place and loved the easy access to Central Park ! If you want to stay in the heart of Manhattan, in a clean, safe, and comfortable home, and at a nice affordable price, this is the answer. Do remember that you'll need to use earplugs to sleep properly.[QWERTY123]I really enjoyed my 1 week stay at Claudio’s place and loved the easy access to Central Park – right out my window across the street!  The upper west side is a beautiful neighborhood with many photo opportunities for shutter-bugs.  Claudio’s home provides an easy-going, quiet, friendly ambience.  If you want to stay in the heart of Manhattan, in a clean, safe, and comfortable home, and at a nice affordable price, this is the answer. Do remember to pick up  earplugs for a good nights sleep. I did, slept like a rock, and enjoyed every day and night of my stay with Manhattan at my doorstep.  Thank-you, Claudio and Kiko![QWERTY123]Great place and great host! Don't forget the earplugs and you will have a great stay!If we come back, we will definitevely go to Claudio's place![QWERTY123]Thank you to Claudio and Kiko!
Your apartment is beautiful and I felt very welcomed and safe.
I would recommend this as a convenient and lovely place to stay for anyone travelling to New York.
Many thanks![QWERTY123]Very good location! Very good person! Very good all! :). I and my girlfriend stay in NY from 5 day. I meet Claudio only last 2 days but Kiko, a person that live with Claudio, are very friendly and helpful! If we will return to NYC certainly to Claudio's Hotel!

Thank you for all

Regards

Antonio & Cristina[QWERTY123]This is a very stylish and efficient place, a true bargain. Apt is super neat and clean, and location near subway and bus is great. I totally recommend it.[QWERTY123]A great location , close to subways and very clean affordable room it was a little noisy but i brought earplugs and i was fine i would stay there again the price was right[QWERTY123]Excellent location, very clean and cozy bedroom in a stylish decorated apartment, tidy bathroom, affordable price. Claudio and Kiko are lovely and easy-going hosts who made me feel very welcome. I had a great time staying with them and recommend this B&B very highly. Many thanks![QWERTY123]The flat is really good: is clean and also in a really good position for the upper west side. Is also closed to the subway. You have your total independence, but if you have a problem or a question Claudio and Kikko are very helpfull with their guest. The guestbedroom is big for manhattam standards, very clean, with your personal air condition and lcd tv. If I plan to come back in NYC I'll certainly choose this flat for my stay in the city.[QWERTY123]Due to a debilitating migraine, I was unable to stay on the dates originally reserved.  Claudio was kind and gracious enough to allow me to reschedule my visit and transferred my reservation to October.

Thanks Claudio!

Kendra K.[QWERTY123]Claudio was the perfect host. The room was exactly what I needed though the noise was a problem some nights. Still I would definitely stay here again. Thanks Claudio![QWERTY123]good location, clean, well kept.  great people.  Everything you need in a short term stay.

highly recommended.

[QWERTY123]Great location, very close to the subway. Remember earplugs and you will sleep like a child. You really have your independence, and Claudio and Kikko are really nice. I would recommend this to others and definetly stay here again. Thank you Claudio and Kikko! (sorry we screwed up the check in and out times...)[QWERTY123]Claudio & Kiko are lovely and very hospitable.   The guest room has a window on a very busy street, so do bring ear plugs if you need a bit of quiet to sleep.  But overall, I felt very welcome and at ease there.[QWERTY123]good location close to every thing. safe area. Claudio was very kind and helpful[QWERTY123]I didn't meet Claudio, but Kiko welcome me very warmly. Interior is stylish and comfortable. Great location, safe area, very clean, tidy bathroom, enough closet space.. everything was good. Especially, thank you for accept my special request![QWERTY123]I had a great stay with Claudio in New York.  The room was great, comfy bed, air conditioned, free wireless internet and even a TV. Claudio and Kiko made me feel very welcome.  The apartment block was safe and also in a safe area, subway really close and I felt safe enough to walk home from the subway.  Would definitely recommend Claudio as a host and would stay again if I ever get back to New York.[QWERTY123]Great stay! great people! Thanks so much Claudio and Kiko for your hospitality... 100% recommendable!

Hope to go back to your place when visiting ny.[QWERTY123]Great stay!  Claudio was a wonderful host and provided any info that I needed
about area.  Good location right on Central Park (across the street) and a short walk to Broadway with all the restaurants and cafes you could want.  New York metro 
is always close from here.  Thanks for everything![QWERTY123]My boyfriend and I stayed with Claudio and Kiko for 2 nights and had a wonderful experience! Location was great and room was very clean and lovely. It is a bit loud but we didn't find it too much of an issue. Would highly recommend staying here ext time you are in fabulous NYC!![QWERTY123]The space was clean and functional. Conveniently close to subway. I'd go there anytime.[QWERTY123]Highly recommended!

Great location, wonderful hosts! Not only the room but the entire apartment is clean, cozy, quiet...

It was the first time that we stayed out of a conventional hotel. And we love it!

As soon as possible, we will repeat the experience.

Thank you Claudio. Thank you Kiko![QWERTY123]I spent a lot of time researching accommodations and Claudio's place looked the best--and WAS the best--a wonderful place to stay! 

Great location a block from the subway in a safe neighborhood and building. You get your own stylish, comfortable and scrupulously *clean* room (you share the bath, but I always felt like I had it to myself). You can't cook, but you can use the refrigerator and microwave.

The room has a comfortable bed, wardrobe, as well as it's own heater and AC, so you can be as warm or cool as you want--a big deal when it comes to comfort. Yes, you should bring earplugs, but that's true of almost any place in NYC because the traffic noise can be loud--but with earplugs I slept soundly, and I never heard any noise from within the apartment.

Claudio gives you a set of keys, so you can come and go as you want--kind of like having your own apartment on fashionable Central Park West! And he was very accommodating about letting me arrive early--as well as leaving my bags until I was ready to go to the airport, then dropping off the keys. 

It couldn't have been an easier, more comfortable or pleasant stay.

Claudio and Kiko are charming guys and great hosts (thank you!) I will definitely stay here again and highly recommend it to my friends.[QWERTY123]Great location, great hosts, safe area+cozy and super clean bedroom. I really enjoyed staying at their place and I strongly recommend this place. If I ever visit New York again, their place would be my first choice! Thanks again, Claudio![QWERTY123]I had a nice time staying at Claudio & Kiko's. We hardly ever ran into one another, so it didn't feel like you were really staying in someone else's home. Their place is warm, cozy and welcoming in a good central location. However, I did find the noise outside to be quite a disturbance - it's really load with traffic and the subway. But then again, the room is fairly priced by Manhattan standards - I guess chiefly because of the noise issue.[QWERTY123]thank you very much Claudio, we enjoyed very much the stay at you place,it was very nice and warm, special thank for the flexible late receive.[QWERTY123]This was our first stay using airbnb and it was a great experience! Claudio and Kiko are great people and wonderful hosts, now friends for us!! They provided any info we needed and helped us feeling like home. A great location , close to the subway and with a beautiful window on Central Park... highly recommended!!
Thank you very much, Claudio, we hope to hear from you again soon and... merry Christmas!!!:)[QWERTY123]I've stayed at Claudio and Kiko  place for 6 nights and had a great time. The room is cozy with air condition, the place is nice and clean. It is very close to the subway with great connections and the area seemed fine to me. Kiko also helped with instructions and pointers what I should check out while staying in NYC. All in all, everything was great and according to promised. Thank you Claudio and Kiko.[QWERTY123]This is a great place to stay, an amazing deal for NYC. I am really into nice sheets and the sheets were great! Place is a block and a half basically from A-C line subway, which makes it very convenient for getting around. It´s across the road from Central Park and walking distance to Columbia University. 

Claudio was really nice and I immediately felt comfortable staying at his place. A lamp was always left on for when I came home late. 

The room has a closet with hanging space, a full length mirror, a heater, bed side lamp and there is wifi. It is also convenient that the apartment is on the first floor (no carting luggage up stairs). I didn´t find the bedroom noise too bad. I would stay again! Thank you...[QWERTY123]Beautiful place, clean, great decoration, really nice people![QWERTY123]It was a pleasure to stay in Claudio and Kiko`s apartment.  The guest room and whole apartment were very stylish, super clean, safe and comfortable to staying. Being just across the street from the Central Park, 20 minutes walk to 5th Avenue, Broadway or few steps from public transport that makes navigating the city so easy.  I would definitely recommend this to my friends and return here again. Thank you![QWERTY123]Great location and great hosts, i recommend this place.They are also very helpful...[QWERTY123]Very clean and comfortable. Two blocks from subway which was extremely convenient.  Neighborhood is safe and quiet, but you have to walk 4 blocks (10 minute walk) to get to a street with coffee shops and restaurants.  Room faces the street and the apartment is on the ground floor so you could hear people walking by and talking.  Also, since the subway runs underground along the street the apartment is on, you could hear the trains going by.  None of the above was an issue for me.   I would definitely stay here again.[QWERTY123]Esperienza fantastica, ambiente piccolo ma molto confortevole e familiare! Ottima disponibilità e libertà all'interno dell'appartamento, Claudio e Chico ci hanno fatto sentire come a casa nostra. Abbiamo usato la cucina per la colazione, ed il frigo per mantenere il cibo. 
L'appartamento è solamente a due isolati dalla metrò (103st). Le prime due notti il rumore della metrò ci ha fatto compagnia, ma con l'uso dei tappi per le orecchie è stato risolto il problema ed abbiamo fatto delle belle dormite. SIcuramente, se dovessimo tornare a New York, l'appartamento di Claudio e Chico sarà la nostra dimora.
Grazie a Claudio e Chico

Ciao
Simone Roberta[QWERTY123]I enjoyed my stay at Claudio's, which is located in a safe neighborhood. Lovely apartment - clean all throughout.  Although I didn't get to meet Claudio personally, his parter, Kiko was very warm and friendly.  I highly recommend staying here when in New York.[QWERTY123]Excellent stay. Clean, great neighborhood. Street level, but not a big deal.[QWERTY123]I loved my stay at Claudio's. His home was immaculately clean and peaceful to return to after a busy day exploring Manhattan. I stayed for 11 nights and found it fantastic to be 2 minutes' walk from the subway. The neighbourhood felt very safe. Highly recommended, and an absolute bargain![QWERTY123]Convenient location. Very clean. High noise levels from subway, general traffic and  voices in the street directly outside the window. Ear plugs did not help very much.[QWERTY123]Our Stay at Claudio's was awesome,we had privacy and the room is great.The noisy streets didnt bother any of us,we didnt have any earplugs but we could sleep with no issues.NYC gets you tired enough to sleep like a baby.We had our own keys and subway is close enough for a walk in (Website hidden by Airbnb) was a great experience and Im glad my boyfriend proposed to me on our last day there![QWERTY123]Claudio is a very considerate and accommodating host.  His apartment, and guest room were very clean and comfortable.[QWERTY123]Notre séjour , ma fille et moi , a été "" Extraordinaire"".
Chez Claudio et Kiko la maison était agréable , propre et très bien située.[QWERTY123]Claudio and Kiko were excellent hosts. The apartment was immaculate and shower was wonderful. The location was also the very best, walk outside and you're in Central Park. We had our room (w/tv and ac), bathroom, and kitchen. Claudio worked in his office during the day and we were able to come and go as we pleased. Also, this was an excellent price. Highly recommended![QWERTY123]Nice and clean place, very gentle host, we had a great time in NYC at Claudio's![QWERTY123]The space was beautiful, clean and pleasant. Great location. We did miss having a kitchen though.[QWERTY123]I enjoyed my Manhattan stay very much! The room was quite comfortable and the passing noise on the street was never a problem for me. Claudio's home is very lovely and very clean! I will admit I was slightly nervous since this was my first stay with any Airbnb affiliate - but after that first initial meeting I knew my nervousness had no place. Claudio was very welcoming and helpful with information about the city. I could not have asked for a better host! Thank you very much for allowing me to stay in your home![QWERTY123]Great value for money. Loved staying so close to Central Park. Easy to get on subway down into town. Friendly hosts. Would stay here again.[QWERTY123]Claudio's apartment is an excellent place to stay. The room is clean, large and air-conditioned and its close proximity to the subway is extremely convenient. We felt very safe walking the block back from the subway to his apartment. I highly recommend staying at Claudio's![QWERTY123]Claudio was great, helped me navigate New York, the location is perfect and if i’m New York again i would definitely stay there again[QWERTY123]It was my first time to the States & I was travelling alone- the room was perfect, very clean, comfortable & with towels & soap provided. There was free wifi which was fast & an air-conditioner & tv in the room. I would definitely stay here again![QWERTY123]Claudio and his apartment were great! His apartment is right next to central park, a subway station and was super cute and clean. He gave us our own keys so we could freely go as we please! We are so glad that we decided to go this route in terms of accommodation in NYC. Some reviews said it was noisy from the subway/street but I don't know what these people are talking about...we could here some honking outside (which was minimal) but we never heard the subway or anything that kept us awake. I will most definitely recommend Claudio's place to any of my friends that will travel to Manhattan in the future...and when we go back, we will definitely stay here again. Thanks Claudio![QWERTY123]Excellent simple location close to the tube station. Very nice and friendly host. Bedroom was very clean and we had internet access. Only downside was that it was a little noisy but I did not mind at all.[QWERTY123]I was very apprehensive about booking accommodation for my daughter who was visiting NY for the first time but Airbnb made it really easy for me and I would not hesitate to recommend them.Claudio promptly answered any emails I sent him. My daughter enjoyed every bit of her stay and would definitely make Claudio's place her first choice if she were to visit NY in the future. 
Sylvia (Malta)[QWERTY123]Clean appartement in a nice building in front of Central Park (very good place for runners!). The appartement on 1st floor is quite noisy the 1st night but we get used to it very fast. This part of Manhattan is quiet and close to good jazz club.150m to the subway, you will be in the heart of Manhattan in 15-20 min. A very good quality/price ratio for Manhattan.Thanks Claudio![QWERTY123]Central place to stay and Kiko gave us a subway train map when we arrived which we appreciated. Bedroom looks out over Central Park rocks, and the street which is very noisy with trucks, train subway noises, night and day. Bed was not particularly comfortable and told to eat and drink in kitchen, however owners ate in their bedroom. Room was cheap & I suppose you only receive what you pay for. Great internet access. Owners did not see us off and we left keys in bedroom.[QWERTY123]A very clean room and bathroom, immaculate bathroom, airconditing and  close to subway to all of New York, no noise and hosts were gracious.  Would do it again.[QWERTY123]Nice and clean room, close to a subway station and closer to a bus stop. Claudio and his roommate are very nice and polite as well. I would  recommend this place to a friend. 

It is somewhat noisy but bearable, it did not make me lose any sleep.[QWERTY123]After our previous reservation's been cancelled, we had the good fortune to find Claudio. His apartment in the upper west side was more than we could've hoped for - clean, easy to get to (right near a subway station) and at a great price too.

Claudio was very nice to talk to and respectful of our privacy. The wifi connection was super-fast and it was very straighforward communicating with Claudio.

The apartment isn't in the downtown area, but it takes just a 10 min subway to get there, day or night. All in all, highly recommended![QWERTY123]Great location merely one block away from the 103 St 'C' subway. Claudio and Kiko are friendly, helpful and non-intrusive. Apartment is clean. Location on the 1st floor means that you do not have to drag your luggage up flights of stairs or use the lift.[QWERTY123]Claudio and his partner Kiko are nice people.  They leave you alone to do your own thing.  The bedroom was very nice.  Bathroom was clean.  The only drawback was the bedroom was a half of a flight of stairs off of the street.  Walk-by traffic is moderate, street traffic is heavy and the subway is under the sidewalk  outside your window with the open grates in the sidewalk so you hear it as well.  I just brought a set of earplugs and that took care of the noise.  Good price for a nice bedroom.[QWERTY123]Claudio is a great host, the room is a great location if you need to be in Downtown Manhattan (it's 2 easy & short blocks from the subway!). Wish that I'd had a less hectic schedule for the time I was there, as it was fun talking with him.

Looking forward to future visits to NYC and Claudio's place will be at the very top of the (very) short list!

An Oasis in The City That Never Sleeps ... (but I was able to!)[QWERTY123]Tudo foi muito bem no apartamento do Claudio. Tudo é limpo, agradável... o chuveiro é forte, a cama é super confotável. Vi que alguns guests reclamaram de barulho durante a noite, mas eu não tive problema nenhum quanto a isso - as noites de sono foram ótimas. Acabamos não comprando nada de supermercado, então só usamos mesmo a cozinha para beber água. Claudio e Kiko são pessoas agradáveis e nada intrusivos... nos deixaram bem à vontade. Resumindo: muito boa estadia. Recomendo a todos. 

Everything was just fine in Claudio´s apartment. Very clean and pleansant... good shower, good bed, good sleep. No noyses during night that could make you asleep or wake-up. Claudio and Kiko are nice guys, non intrusive... Resuming: that was a very good stay. I recomend to anyone.[QWERTY123]Claudio's apartment was a great find! It is clean, comfortable, and in a great location. We drove and had no trouble finding a free parking spot on the street right around the corner. Claudio is very nice and a great host.

If you end up staying here, make sure to go to Absolute Bagels (2788 Broadway) and Silver Moon Bakery (2740 Broadway).[QWERTY123]This was my first trip to New York and my first time using Airbnb and both experiences were great. I'm actually still in the apartment waiting fort lift to the airport when I got the email to leave a review. My stay went very well when I arrived I was met by Claudio and he introduced himself and showed me the room and left me to get on with my trip. He was very helpful when I asked for some information, I didn't see him much as he went to Brazil but his partner Kiko was here who was also very helpful aswell as his assistant Who works here during the day. 

I would highly recommend staying here subway only 2 blocks away and it in Times Square in minutes and the area feels really safe also. Plus the price is very good u can't go wrong

The noise that other reviewers have talked about was not an issue at all!!!
[QWERTY123]A friend and i stayed at Claudio's apartment, and we are so happy because we couldn't find a better host, he is so so so kind, and never bother us about time schedule or things like that.
The place is awesome and very clean, just the idea to wake up right in front of the central park every single day, make me wanna go again. 
I wont think twice if i need to go to NYC again, of course if he let me, i will stay at his place again.[QWERTY123]the host was kind and perfect.
the room was too noisy' , we could hear everything from the street, too small.
[QWERTY123]Everything was first rate - exactly as described - excellent location and high standard in all respects.[QWERTY123]The reservation was canceled 7 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.[QWERTY123]This is an amazing location - across the street from Central Park - for a very reasonable price. (Note, however, the fees are high relative to the nightly rate; this reduces the value a bit.) In fairness, for this review, the host was away the entire time, so I had the entire charming place to myself (except the host's locked locations). Since it is small, and one would be sharing the bathroom and kitchen with the host, the experience would necessarily be different. The small kitchen was nice, and well equipped. There is an excellent large (by NYC standards) market a few blocks away on 110th St at the NW corner of the park. Very close subway stop on 103rd St. Easy walk to Harlem, Columbia Univ, etc.

The unit is on the bottom floor at street level, and the bedroom window opens onto the Central Park West sidewalk at street level. So one must expect some noise, as with any similar NYC location, and particularly with a window AC unit (reasonably quiet, but also a good source of white noise). There is also street light that leaks in, and in the morning light comes in early (east facing window). A good pair of earplugs, and an mask made sleeping - and sleeping in - easy and pleasant. 

Claudio's assistant Kiko - who handled all the arrangements on this occasion - was very pleasant, helpful and accommodating.[QWERTY123]Amazing place, location, space, everything, one of the best places I've stayed in NYC. Thank you Claudio and Kiko.[QWERTY123]This is one of the best Airbnb apartment I’ve been in. Stylish design, spotless space, awesome location. I can’t wait to visit again.[QWERTY123]Claudio’s place is perfect, it’s bang opposite Central Park, it’s a bit away from the Center but at the price which it comes it’s so worth it, and to get to the heart of the city and anywhere else it takes less then 10 minutes which is nothing. I got the whole place to myself as Claudio was travelling. And Kiko helped generously with any and everything. It was a delightful stay. Thank you for offering your house in New York! Definitely recommended.[QWERTY123]This place has everything you want. Comfortable bed, scarily good internet, good location, good transfer links, very clean and a good service. Couldn't recommend it highly enough![QWERTY123]It’s my first airbnb booking and all will be amazing. Good place near Central Park. I’m glad![QWERTY123]Very much enjoyed my stay at Claudio’s place. He is a very kind host and the bed was incredibly comfy. 

Subway is around the corner and the room looks onto Central Park. You literately only have to cross the street to get to it. Only downside is the noise from the street as the room is located on 1st floor. But after a long day, I was so exhausted, it didn’t bother me really.[QWERTY123]Sparkling clean, very comfortable, nice room, unobtrusive host, minutes from subway.
Very pleasant stay for the weekend. Definitely recommended."	40.79826449437067	-73.96113437012922	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/6021	1	85.0	0.775
32	18195	"Our experience was very positive and uncomplicated:

Justin and roommate Josh (Ildiko was abroad) are helpful and friendly and take their role as hosts seriously. The apartment is located close enough to the subway AND the Long Island rail road (and to LGA), the Woodside neighborhood offers ample ethnic food options. Located on a quiet street, the apt is modern and clean and comfy. Priced very reasonable. Definitely worth considering when visiting the NYC area.[QWERTY123]Justin & Ildiko are awesome hosts and completed our trip. They're very knowledgeable about the whereabouts to go locally and made some great suggestions about good eats, transportations and local scenic places. The room itself was neat and comfortable, the place very convenient as I had to travel throughout the 5 boroughs. We thoroughly enjoy our stay and wouldn't hesitate to stay there again, anytime. We wish to cook something for them someday :D Recommend, recommended.[QWERTY123]A definite 5-star review! Justin and Ildiko are perfect hosts and the room I took - King of Queens - was great. The flat and area are quiet and tidy. I felt very much at home and would surely stay with them again and recommend them to anybody. Justin and Ildiko - thank you![QWERTY123]Justin and Ildiko were really great hosts!!! They are very nice, warm and friendly. Their apt is spacious, really nice (Justin did a great job with the new bathroom!) and well located. The neighborhood is also quiet and safe. Highly reccommended if you are planning to visit NY[QWERTY123]Justin & Ildiko are realy wonderful. 
They give you every freedom you need and every information you ask for. 
If you need them, they help you.
If you want to experience NYC on your one, they let you.
Their appartment is beautiful and well-located. 
You experience NYC like you are living there. 
The subway is just around the block and it feels like less than 15 minutes before you're in the centre of NYC. (I think it is about 20 minutes max.)
Thank you so much, you guys. 
Tilde[QWERTY123]Justin & Ildiko are fantastic hosts, very friendly and always happy to give advice on stuff to do. The room is totally beautiful, in fact their whole apartment is. The private ensuite bathroom is lush and their kitchen is gorgeous. The location is great too, very close to Times Sq on the subway. I would definitely recommend this place and would definitely book again.[QWERTY123]This booking was my first experience with airbnb - and was the perfect choice! The apartment is very tasteful furnished, my own room was very big and quiet. It had its own bathroom with a shower, so you have a lot of privacy. I loved to come ""home"" after a busy day and to cook something in the wonderful kitchen with all utensils needed. I could use the WiFi and the public laundry room downstairs. The room is airconditioned and has a ventilator. Justin and Ildiko were very busy but always took their time to answer all my questions and give me helpful recommendations. The apartment is nearby to two subway-stations of the line 7 (during the rush-hour you can use the express) and the LIRR. There are nice little shops for essential goods, a library, bars and restaurants in the proximity - especially the sushi-restaurant I will really miss. In the apartment of Justin and Ildiko you really feel like ""King of Queens""![QWERTY123]Excellent place to stay if you are planning a trip to NYC!  The room was very clean and comfortable (the air conditioning helped with it being 100 degrees for two days we were there).  We never actually saw Justin and Ildiko but they were available by phone/email/text . The entire apartment was beautiful and very convenient to get around to NYC.[QWERTY123]Another definite 5-star review! The room I took (King of Queens with Private Bathroom) was just great! It is quiet, comfortable and I loved the windows in the corner and the sunny mornings. The private bathroom is  luxury and the whole apartment is well designed. The kitchen is just as perfect as it is shown on the pictures. But the most important fact is, that Justin and Josh are great hosts. Justin and Ildiko were abroad during my stay but they answered every question immediately and gave helpful hints whenever needed.  Josh, his flatmate, is easy-going, humorous and just as said before –  in this apartment everyone can profit of his or her own space but at the same time find company if wanted. Thank you so much! I do not have to add anything to the previous reviews about public transport and the area...Highly recommend.[QWERTY123]This was my and my partner's first visit to NY and first airbnb experience. Overall I am really pleased with the bouth :) My review:
Booking: we booked the place several months before the visit. The official host Justin was there for any question i had (and there was a lot). He provided us with all the details.
Apt: The room is really big. There are 2 windows on the rear but sunny side. The bath is renovated (the room is not) and it is very nice. There is a closet in the room, that we did not use. The appartment was clean. 
Building: It's pretty old. And one could feel it. But I think it is kept well. The walls are thin, some times you hear some noise from the neighbors. However, in the evening it's very quite. We are really sensitive to any noise, but we had a great sleep.
Neighborhood: This part of Queens populated mostly by immigrants. It's safe and quite. One can get the idea of the real city, not the turistic one. That exactly that we were looking for. The place has good connection to midtown by subway (lines 7 and R) and LIRR. The last is the fastest way to get to midtown but more expensive.
Host: We did not meet Justin & Ildiko, because they were abroad. Our host was Josh. He is a great guy. He is very friendly and  kind. Always tried to help us and to answer our questions. He is very quite person as well.
Overall: We had great time. Recomended

September 2013[QWERTY123]Justin was a wonderful host. His apartment is spotless and it felt just like home. The private bathroom makes the stay very hassle free. There are many restaurants and bars in the neighborhood and the 7 train makes travel very easy. We were able to stay a week in NYC without the need for an uber, taxi, etc. It is very easy to travel to LGA from the apartment as well. 
[QWERTY123]Justin has beautiful space in a very quiet building.  Only 2 blocks from the train (but not a hint of the noise) so very easy to get into the city.  Not far from I278 and street parking was reasonably easy to fine.  Hope to stay our next time through NYC.[QWERTY123]Justins place is great, the area is very nice and it is just a few blocks away from cool bars and restaurants. The complex has a laundry room which was super convenient for us, and there are grocery stores very near. The place is quiet and perfect to relax after a day in the city. The room is exactly as advertised and the bed super comfortable. Big common areas and very clean. One of the best Airbnb experiences we have ever had. Justin is the best Airbnb host you can find, he is so friendly and welcoming. And he made sure that we felt at home the whole time. We can’t wait to be back and visit his lovely apartment again.[QWERTY123]Justin’s hospitality was great! I love the room and felt like I had a lot of space of my own including a private ensuite bathroom which made the stay comfortable and convenient. The apartment is very large and spacious and the kitchen is beautifully renovated![QWERTY123]My girlfriend and I stayed at Justin's apartment this summer. Justin is an enthusiastic host and really cares about his guests. The room was large and everything is exactly as described in the posting. The bathroom was very spacious and clean. Further, Justin gave us full access to the kitchen which we used daily. The area is very safe and close to multiple subway stops. The apartment worked out extremely well for us and we would recommend staying here to anyone. Ask Justin about the local spots when you visit![QWERTY123]Justin is an amazing host! He made us feel so welcomed that I didnt want to leave his place. Great room and apartment in an awesome neighborhood. Justin told us about places to eat and what public transportation to use. Honestly I couldn't have asked for a better host. Thanks Justin!!![QWERTY123]The apartment is close to the metro station and several markets, bars and restaurants. The room is spacious and the bed comfortable. The kitchen has everything we need and we use it without any problem. Justin is a very attentive and flexible host. I definitely recommend it."	40.745901875605846	-73.90763989214304	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/18195	2	90.0	0.8
33	18198	"I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at Justin & Ildiko's apartment. The room gorgeous apartment was nicely decorated and the room I stayed in was large and clean and the bathroom was beautiful! The kitchen is awesome and has a nice view of the park across the street. The other roommates are friendly and Justin was extremely kind and helpful when I arrived and consistently checked everything was going ok. The area is fantastic because of its proximity to Manhattan and it has everything you need; grocery store, restaurants, Banks and a drug store. It is a safe residential area and the other people in the building are very nice. I would definitely consider staying here again, if the opportunity arose.  It was really a pleasure.  Thanks!![QWERTY123]We can't recommend Justin & Ildiko highly enough, they are awesome hosts and made our stay in New York so comfortable and easy. They have a great knowledge of the city and their apartment is brilliant. A definite 5 star recommendation from us. Thanks again guys, Matt and Vanessa[QWERTY123]Thanks, Justin and Ildiko! Your place made my stay in NYC really good! I had a very nice room and was so happy about the bath room. I loved the view onto the park and listening to school kid's voices in the morning. I felt always secure, and there are many facilities to buy staff for the daily needs. You also can find several bars/cafes to go out for a nice dinner. A really good thing is to come home from the busy city and can ralax at the very cozy pleace. I arrived via JFK, and so the appartment was perfect to stay - you have a great connection via LIRR. Conclusion: highly recommended - also for alone travelling women.
Thanks, Martina[QWERTY123]Jusitn and Ildiko were absolutely fantastic, friendly hosts.  The room and apartment were perfect (had a chic boutique hotel feel to it).  The location was ideal and convenient. The price was right.  I would highly recommend staying here during your visit to New York![QWERTY123]Justin & Ildiko were excellent hosts. I'd never stayed with hosts before except for in more formalized, inn-like, B&B set ups and I was a little bit nervous socially. Justin was at the apartment to greet me and I immediately felt at ease, we were chatting like old friends in minutes. 

The apartment is spacious for New York with ample common space and a nice kitchen. I stayed in the ""little king of queens"" with clean, separate, bath and was very comfortable. 

The location in Woodside is very convenient for the seasoned NYC traveler or the budget tourist, just one stop from the JFK airtrain on the LIRR and right on the express 7 line to Grand Central & Times Square. The neighborhood itself features a good wine shop, several decent ethnic grocers, and the best Thai food I have had outside of Thailand. 

I don't see any reason to ever stay anywhere else in NYC again. 
[QWERTY123]to make it short: it was the perfect choice for new york!

.5min. walk to train/subway station & grocery stores.
.proximity to city (20min. to grand central).
.ildiko & justin are great and easy going people.
.very clean and tidy (Website hidden by Airbnb) just felt like coming home at night.

should we come back to new york we would definitely like to stay at little king of queens again. 

[QWERTY123]Justin&Ildiko are the perfect host. We arrived at very unconvenient time at night (1.30 am) and they both were waiting for us awake. Useful for any infos required abt directions.
Location of the house is in a quiet street, 4 blocks far from the train number 7 which in 20min time is taking you in Times Square!
Overall i would highly recommend to try the Little Queen of Queens![QWERTY123]This apartment is GORGEOUS and Justin and Ildiko are very gracious and generous hosts.  I really enjoyed my stay here, it suited me very well.

The apartment is located in a lovely quiet area and opposite a park which luckily for me, was snow covered during my whole stay, it was so pretty. Having my own bathroom was a great selling point for me, which for this price range, is not that common in New York!  

The apartment is close to the subway, the city, the airport and you have everything close to hand when required.  I have no negative feedback at all and highly recommend this room.  Thanks so much for your hospitality and I would love to come back again![QWERTY123]My stay at the Little King of Queens couldn't have been better.  Justin and Ildiko were very gracious and respectful hosts, and their apartment is perfect.  
The room overlooks a park in a nice area of Queens.  Even when I came back to the apartment late at night, I felt very safe walking around the neighborhood.  
They have recently redone the kitchen and bathroom, and all the appliances are top notch.  Great water pressure and a shower head that any traveler can appreciate after a long day.  
One of the biggest perks of this place is that it's the last stop on the LIRR to Manhattan.  Walk six short blocks to the station and catch a train that goes straight to Penn Station in ten minutes!  I've been staying in Williamsburg, Bay Ridge, and other parts of west Brooklyn before this, but it took anywhere from 30 minutes to an hour and a half to reach Manhattan by the Subway (especially late at night).
Thanks again Justin and Ildiko for a pleasant stay![QWERTY123]Great, friendly couple. Very helpful if you're new to the city. Lovely room with fantastic shower.[QWERTY123]First experience with Airbnb and my sister and me are so happy about it! We don't have regrets at all about the place we chose. Justin and Ildiko are great!! They take it easy, they fun and so you feel immediately like at home! The place is amazing! Great apartment, great room and the bathroom!! We loveed it! It was new and clean!!! Everything was perfect! I even don't find the words to explain, it was just perfect, just what we expected for a first Airbnb experience. And for the location, that's the best! 5 minutes walking to go grocery and 5 minutes walking to go to the subway/LIRR train, the number 7 goes straight downtown (Grand Central or Time square). We loved spent time with justin&Ildiko in this place and if we had to go back in NYC one day, for sure, it will be in this place![QWERTY123]Ildiko & Justin got a spacious and lovely apartment. The room was very nice and clean, just as the private bathroom with shower and bathtub was. Shared rooms like parlor and dining room were tidy and cozy. The renovated kitchen with its huge fridge and all imaginable utensils was amazing! Rooms were air-conditioned. The two of them were very kind and helpful and always contactable concerning questions and advice. There wasn't anything to complain about during our stay... Even the apartment's vicinity in Queens was pleasant and vibrant, Manhattan / Time Square could be reached by subway within 20 minutes +5 minutes walking to the station.[QWERTY123]My boyfriend and I had an awesome time in NY - espacially because of Justin and Ildiko, they are wonderful person! They gave us plenty of tips of where to go and what to do! We really appreciated their help! Would definitly stay with them again next time we go to NY! Their appartment is amazing, the location is great - couldn't be better! It really felt like home in a city that we didn't know![QWERTY123]Ildiko & Justin waren perfekte Gastgeber. Die Verbindung nach Midtown und auch zum JFK Airport ist sehr gut. Wir würden auf jeden Fall wieder kommen.[QWERTY123]We had an 8 night's great stay in Justin&Ildiko apartment! It is really closed to the subway which takes you directly to Times Square in 15-20 minutes and it's easy to reach from the JFK Airport.
Justin & Ildiko were very helpful with all our questions, and had great suggestions for us.
The room and the bathroom for the guests were clean and the bed very comfortable.
So..we recommend this solution as a great alternative to Manhattan's rooms!

Walter & Vale[QWERTY123]Justin and Ildiko are simply fantastic! Their apartment is spotlessly clean, with a very well equipped kitchen with everything you could need. Everything is tasteful and well designed. The room is cosy quiet and comfortable (and over looks a park as well) and the private bathroom is modern and clean.  The area is great - safe and close to Manhattan. Great transport links with two subways lines (7 and M) close by, the long island railroad and lots of buses. Amazing food options - I've never eaten so well (and far better and cheaper than Manhattan!). And as for the hosts, well, they're fabulous. They're not around much and they have their own living room so you have your own space but at the same time they bend over backwards to be helpful and they're great company if you do want to chat. I couldn't recommend this place more highly!![QWERTY123]I spent a wonderful time in the apartment of Justin and Ildiko. They both are very kind people, generous and trustful. For me the best adress to stay in New York. The apartement is clean, cozy and having own bathroom is splendid. And also has a very good location.
When I'll come back to NY I will always go to them, my best recommendation.
[QWERTY123]I had a great time staying on Queens really close to the city, near the apartament you can find everything youll need restaurants a nice little park and a few block away on queens boulevard there are available a bunch of stores , if youre staying here take the 7 train to manhattan it will take you directly to grand central station or to times square station. Great place to stay. Really happy with the overall experience. Justin and ildiko are just great Hosts they make me feel just like at home. This is the place to stay ! The bathroom its private and just really really nice and the all apartament its just beatiful.[QWERTY123]Justin & Ildiko's place is really clean and tidy, not single speck of dust can be found!  It takes around 10 minutes to walk to the nearest subway station (Woodside). From Woodside to Time Squares, it takes around 15-20 minutes, which is considered fast.  Overall, we enjoyed our stay there as Justin is a friendly and understanding host. Thanks Justin & Ildiko ! :)[QWERTY123]We had an EXCELLENT visit. From beginning to end, Justin, Ildiko & Josh provided GREAT communication, that was timely and always courteous. As advertised, the apartment is VERY CLEAN and VERY COMFORTABLE. The Woodside neighborhood is safe with 2 CONVENIENT subway locations an easy 6 blocks away. Thank you all for being such wonderful hosts.!!![QWERTY123]Great place! Highly recommended, very clean and comfortable, the roommates are friendly and relaxed. The location is perfect, with a direct line to Times Square and all the good stuff, restaurants and stores nearby.  Like I said,  highly recommended![QWERTY123]I immediately felt welcome at Justin's place. The neighborhood was great. There is a park directly across the street which you can cross to get to more streets with grocery stores and restaurants. It is about an 8 minute walk to the 7 stop and the Long Island Railroad. The 7 train takes about 15-25 minutes to get to Grand Central depending on if you take the express train. I never felt unsafe walking from the apartment to the train! I will definitely rent here again. It was my first time in New York and I am so so so grateful for having a place that was clean and roommates who I could hang out with at home or meet out somewhere. I highly recommend staying here with Justin and Joern!!![QWERTY123]Always a great experience staying here.   Great host. Great apartment. Great location.  
Thanks again![QWERTY123]Staying with Justin was a amazing experience. He was very warm-hearted and funny. The apartment was newly renovated, clean and absolutely beautiful. The neighborhood was safe, quiet and close to train stations. Not to mention that there are tons of grocery stores, restaurants and all other kinds of stores around. Justin was always there to help me out and provide whatever I needed. I am very very glad that I choose to stay here and I appreciate everything that Justin did."	40.75038235503308	-73.9033391811535	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/18198	2	70.0	0.833333

It was a great pleasure to get to know him and Brooklyn.[QWERTY123]My girlfriend and I stayed with Blaise for five nights and everything worked out very well. The accommodations were excellent and we were impressed with the architecture of the space. We would definitely recommend this place to friends & family.[QWERTY123]Excellant accomodations at a reasonable cost.
Pleasant host.
Located on a quiet street across form a very nice park.
Good access to subways, restaurants, food markets.
Recommended!
[QWERTY123]Blaise is very friendly and easy to get along with. We stayed at Blaise's place for a week and had a great experience. The apartment is very beautiful and has all the accommodations one need. Blaise is an excellent host and we can strongly recommend him to anyone visiting NY.[QWERTY123]Blaise was a fantastic host!  

His place is conveniently located in Brooklyn; with easy access to the subway.  We were able to relax comfortably in his beautiful home.  He is extremely friendly and kind.  We even forgot a blanket and he was kind enough to send it home to us!

Our New York trip was a great experience for us and Blaise made it all possible.  Definitely recommend for others.

Jay & Dav[QWERTY123]Blaise has an excellent place complete with a fantastic bathroom, amazing deck, and convenient location to local joints in Brooklyn as well as easy access to the subway to head into the city. Blaise is very cordial and provides guests with the upmost privacy as well as comforts so one feels like they are staying in their own home. It was my first airbnb experience and because of it I plan to make more frequent use of this service![QWERTY123]Blaise is a thoughtful, gracious host and his home was beautiful and comfortable. Our bedroom and bathroom were clean and tastefully decorated. We enjoyed the neighborhood which was historic and had good food and drink options. It was also nice to be right across the street from Fort Greene park. Getting to and from Manhattan was fairly easy. My boyfriend and I had a good stay![QWERTY123]It was a pleasure to stay at this beautiful, qiet, very clean and spacious appartement. I totally recommend Blaise´ place for an upgraded stay in NYC! We didn´t know Blaise lived in that app beforehand, but he made it very easy for us to feel comfortable. This is the best choise I´ve ever made for a stay in NYC![QWERTY123]My husband and I had a most enjoyable five day stay at the 4th floor brownstone townhouse of Blaise Backer. As a host, Blaise was welcoming, supportive and most respectful of our space. His home is beautifully and comfortably decorated. The kitchen area is well organized and we were able to store a few perishables  in his refrigerator and use the microwave and ""hot water tap"" to fix simple breakfasts before setting out for the day. Blaise indicated that we could use his kitchen to prepare larger meals if we desired.
One of the best features of Blaise's home is a roof top garden area off of his upstair's study. Herbs and vegetables surround the space and it is a wonderful place to have breakfast or read. 
The location of Blaise's home is ideal. It is located on a quiet street across from Fort Greene Park. And it is within walking distance of some great restaurants.
We look forward to visiting his home again while visiting our family in Brooklyn.[QWERTY123]I enjoyed my stay in Blaise's place very much. The flat looks just like the pics. The room is big enough with a huge closet and the whole place is very clean and cosy. It is rather quiet and I slept very well.

This was my first booking with airbnb, a very pleasant experience and the reason I will use it again.[QWERTY123]We really enjoyed our stay in Brooklyn.

It's also perfectly located regarding transports and discovering the neighbourhood. In brief: highly recommended! Thanks again guys for everything![QWERTY123]It was our first time making this type of travel arrangement - we enjoyed our stay and thank them both! Just like others have said so well below, Blaise and his partner are excellent hosts and the room, private bathroom and home are just like the pictures.  A quiet and safe neighborhood, and a walk past the park to the subway stations can get you into the city on a good schedule.[QWERTY123]As soon as we walked into the apartment we felt welcomed. It's very spacious,clean, and modern (just like the pictures). Blaise and Eric were very patient with our questions. Love the neighborhood and it was a bonus to be across from Fort Greene Park. The bedroom was spacious and having a private bathroom is a big plus. Definitely recommend to all.[QWERTY123]Blaise was a friendly host who provided us with a spacious, clean, and quiet space in a great neighbourhood.[QWERTY123]I booked this spot on behalf of my parents who were coming to visit me in Brooklyn. As such, I am posting a review on their behalf. They found the accommodations to be perfect and charming. The hosts were equally amenable to their needs. I have no doubt they'll call on me to book the very same spot again when next they come to town.[QWERTY123]Great apartment - very clean and stylish. Eric and Blaise are great too. Ideally located close to a nice park.[QWERTY123]Blake and Erik couldn't have been nicer or more pleasant. The apartment is gorgeous, looking out on beautiful Fort Greene park. They made me feel right at home.[QWERTY123]Blaise was great, a beautiful apartment in Forte Green, recently refurbished and with lovely roof deck. Room was comfortable and lots of space to spread out, it has its own bathroom, with the deepest bath tub ever. The open plan lounge has dining table and big sofa for watching tv.  The area is great, lots of bar and restaurants. This brownstone building is opposite the park as well. Blaise was super nice and welcoming. Top recommend from me, who has stayed in some shockers before. This is top 3.[QWERTY123]lovely digs, lovely and respectful hosts.  Blaise and Eric are top-notch people of the most upstanding character.  it was a pleasure to meet you both.  your generosity, calm and deference were very much appreciated and my enjoyable stay in Brooklyn owed largely to the privacy, comfort and safety that your accommodations provided.  I felt very fortunate to have discovered your listing and to have been a guest in your beautiful home.[QWERTY123]Recommended. We have been there seven nigths and everything worked out very well
Blaise and Eric are very friendly and helpful hosts
It was our first time in NYC with some doubt about the location to choose but is very well comunicated by subway to head into the city
and the room is confortable[QWERTY123]We had a wonderful time staying at Blaise and Eric. The location is great, green an quite, bus and metro stations within walking distance and the appartment is exactly as luxurious as shown on the pictures.
Both, Eric and Blaise did their utmost to make our stay pleasent and comfortable, they helped us a lot with all questions and especially during the hurricane Sandy when we had to rebook our flights five times.
Many thanks again to both of them for their great and very helpful assistance!
This is a 5 star recommendation and we would always choose this place again when coming back to New York City.[QWERTY123]Our stay with Blaise was excellent. Not only was the apartment fantastic with great transport links, but Blaise as a host was extremely friendly, welcoming and informative. Would definitely stay here again - fully recommended. Thanks Blaise![QWERTY123]This room is in a very stylish and comfy apartment in a great neighborhood. (We recommend dinner at Brooklyn Sandwich Shop, which just opened around the corner). The huge bad in the private bathroom is a major plus! Blaise and Erik were very relaxed hosts.[QWERTY123]Amazing place in Fort Greene right on the park. The bathroom was ridiculous (in a good way)--the best shower in Brooklyn! Futon was firm and comfy and the organized closet space was super handy. Just wish we could've utilized that rooftop deck but alas, the great blizzard of '13 prevented that from happening. It was so great to walk out the door and see everyone in Fort Greene sledding in the park. Many thanks to Blaise and Eric for being such lovely hosts.[QWERTY123]My mom stayed with Blaise and Eric while visiting us here in Fort Greene.  We've been looking for a place that is near our apartment as hotels are not within walking distance, and this ""b&b"" was perfect!  Blaise and Eric are wonderful hosts, and their apartment is absolutely beautiful.  It was a perfect spot for my mom, who was here primarily to spend time with our son (her first grandchild!).  She felt very comfortable with the apartment and the location, and I can't wait for her next visit so she can stay here again![QWERTY123]Second time here says it all - great apartment, great location, great hosts.

Thanks again Blaise & Eric![QWERTY123]This was a very welcoming and caring home.

For our first time in New York we couldn't think of a better experience with our stay. 

We recommend this home to anyone staying in NYC.[QWERTY123]It was very great week, amazing comfortable apartment, very big and beautiful view. Very sunny balcony and silence  area.  Thank you, Blaise, he very good explained about NYC and recommended  interesting places.[QWERTY123]I recently spent 8 days at Blaise's apartment. His home was beautifully renovated and well-maintained. Blaise was an accommodating host and made himself readily available to answer all of my questions about how to navigate the city. He was also respectful of my personal space, which made the experience of staying at his home comfortable and enjoyable. I would recommend staying at this home to anyone who wants to enjoy the charm of Brooklyn while being in close proximity to all that Manhattan has to offer.[QWERTY123]Sorry to answer this late ! Our stay at Washington Park was simply perfect. Ideal location to feel the ""Brooklyn ambiance""... Just in front of the park, in the heart of a very quiet area (just 3 stations away from Manhattan frenzy !). The apartment is awesome, kinda loft duplex type, spacious and tastefully decorated by Blaise who was very kind and confident toward us. Discrete and quite busy host, we didn't talk so many times during our 8 days stay, actually, but we really felt at home. The comfortable futon allowed us to really recover from the exhausting walks in the city and, frankly, the roof deck is a true bonus (as well as the private & nice bathroom) ! Thanx again, Blaise. We recommend your place to other travelers...[QWERTY123]We had a perfect holiday in NYC and to choose Blaise apartmernt for our stay was a really good decision! The flat is amazing and Blaise is a perfect host! The park and the area where the house is located are really nice and it's the perfect starting point to explore Brooklyn, Williamsburg and Manhattan - you should start your trip with a walk from the flat to the Brooklyn Bridge and cross the Bridge to Manhattan![QWERTY123]We had a great time here in NY.! What a nice place to stay! Blaise let us use his home like it was ours, loved the roofdeck. He was even so super to give us extra time ;) it's highly recommended, if he wants us we we will be back :)
Thank you Blaise to be able to trust is into your home! Hope to see/hear from you in the future.
Karine & Dominique[QWERTY123]We had a great time at Blais place. He is a greate host, very relaxed and makes you feel at home. He was very accomodating to our needs and was very quick with feedback when we had questions before the booking. His place is great with an amazing roof top. Very clean and comfortable. Our whole stay was only positive. Thanks again Blaise for the great hospitality.[QWERTY123]Staying at Blaise's place was a great experience. We enjoyed the very nice room and appartment, ideal location and neighbourhood. The room is very quiet and clean, which was very much appreciated. The private bathroom was beautiful and also very clean. All in all, all was perfect, and Blaise is a friendly and helpful host. We would definitely come back. Thanks![QWERTY123]Nice bedroom and bathroom in a beautiful quiet appartment, well located to visit Brooklyn and Manhattan (only a few metres from a citibike docking station!). Blaise is an excellent host, friendly and informing.[QWERTY123]It was clean and a home away from home. Blaise is a great host. I felt right at home when i arrived. I would definitely recommend to friends who need a quick place to crash.[QWERTY123]Blaise was a great host. His place is amazing. It was a great place to stay for almost 2 weeks.[QWERTY123]What a place! Fort greene is a nice green area, the apartment is  magnificent and Blaise is a great host. Recommended.[QWERTY123]Best place to stay! Beautiful and quiet, but nevetheless very near to all the N.Y sights.
Thank you Blaise for leaving me your apartement in such a relaxed and trusting way! J enjoyed my stay very much and recommend this place to everyone![QWERTY123]My friend and I stayed here for 4 nights, and even though it's a guest room, it's definitely worth the stay. You have your own bathroom (with one of the best showers ever made) and a spacious living room area. Blaise is a great host and I would definitely stay here again.[QWERTY123]Nice location, close to the Metro and Manhattan. The apartment is very beautiful and very clean and the top of the top you have your own bathroom! 
Blaise was very discrete and respectful. I can only give 5 stars :-) and of course I recommend it! 
Once again thank you very much Blaise:-)[QWERTY123]Unbeatable location directly on Fort Greene Park in a brownstone duplex that should be in the next Brooklyn Design book. Lovely host and absolutely a best of New York City Airbnb experience. Highest recommendation![QWERTY123]Blaise was a great host and we enjoyed our stay a lot in his beautiful apartment![QWERTY123]We stayed in Fort Greene over spring break. This is a great apartment with a nice small room for two. The private bathroom is clean, beautiful and a real treat to have after a long day in New York. This apartment is two blocks from great restaurants and shops and about 5 km walk to the heart of Williamsburg. We had a wonderful time in New York. Highly Recommended Fort Greene Retreat on the Park.[QWERTY123]We had a great time visiting New York. Staying at Blaise’s place perfectly fitted our needs. A clean, comfortable and warm home, hosted by a kind and gentle host.  Blaise was a very respectful and easy-going guy. He also was considerate of our independence and always greeted us with a smile. His private bathroom is really a big hit! We would definitely stay with him again.[QWERTY123]Our first NYC trip: We had a wonderful time in Brooklyn. The apartment is very clean, spacious and furnished in the best of taste. Blaise was a very friendly and trustful host and we would alwasy love to come back![QWERTY123]My friend and I stayed here for 3nights.
Nice location, close to many restaurants and bars,  and the Metro. we can go everywhere in Brooklyn and Manhattant from his place.  The apartment is very beautiful and very clean. The good things is to have your own bathroom! 
Blaise is a great host[QWERTY123]Superb apartment, probably the best kitchen and shower I've ever seen (the private bathroom is a plus). Great neighbourhood, right next to a park and very calm. Easy access to many subway lines. Blaise is a great host, easy going and helpful with suggestions. The bed is okay. Would go back anytime. Thanks Blaise![QWERTY123]Great location if you don't wanna be on Manhattan, but still close. Very pleasant and authentic neighbourhood. 
Very clean and cool apartment. Blaise is a friendly and relaxed host. 
The room itself is kinda standard, but there's what you need and you sleep very well there - and it's awesome having your own (and top-notch) bathroom.
Can definitely recommend this place![QWERTY123]Great apartment, and well located. 
We didn't feel very welcome. Strange communication with the host and in the end he left for the weekend and didn't say goodbye before. Wouldn't stay there again...[QWERTY123]The apartment is in an excellent location, especially for our purposes being close to our son's home. An excellent location in general terms on a relatively quiet street (for Brooklyn), facing the park. Apartment is absolutely beautifully designed and decorated. Guest room is quite basic but on the back of the building so very quiet. Blaise offers full use of kitchen, etc. which we did not need. We will stay there again.[QWERTY123]Blaise was very informative and welcoming. All was as described, both his home and the neighborhood were beautiful.[QWERTY123]It was a beautiful flat in a really nice part of Brooklyn. There were A LOT of nice places to eat and drink around and having to walk only 5 or 10 minutes to find a nice dinner made us feel at home. The room is small but the bathroom is amazing - biggest tub ever. Getting to the subway is a bit of a walk but there's a cafe called The Hungry Ghost nearby - definitely recommended for delicious coffees and donuts from Dough. Blaise was a good and communicative host.[QWERTY123]Blaise's home is truly a retreat and he was a wonderful host!  We came up to NYC for a Thursday wedding and Blaise was very flexible with our last minute schedule changes.  He met us at his apartment, explained everything and was more than willing to answer any questions we had along the way.  We felt completely comfortable in his home and very much enjoyed our stay.  The apartment is very clean and the most beautiful place I've seen yet in NYC![QWERTY123]Fabulously appointed apartment, conveniently near transportation in very hip Brooklyn. Blaise was a perfect host and prepared the room (with its own bathroom) as if he were welcoming family. A comfortable and restful stay.[QWERTY123]Everything everyone says about this place is true. Definitely recommend staying here![QWERTY123]Blaise war ein sehr guter Gastgeber! Unaufdringlich, aber stets zuvorkommend bei Fragen. Das Appartement ist wie in der Beschreibung- toll eingerichtet, sauber und verkehrsgünstig gelegen. Definitiv eine Empfehlung! Wir würden nochmal bei Blaise bleiben![QWERTY123]Beautiful apartment. Everything was as described.  We stayed for only two nights but had a good time. There was some miscommunication about our check-in time but Blaise was very accommodating and we able to work things out. We hope to stay with Blaise again next time we visit NYC.[QWERTY123]We just spent four days at the Fort Greene Retreat. For us , the location was perfect....near family we were visiting in Fort Greene. We also appreciated that it was an easy ten minute walk to a few different subways, across the street from the lovely Saturday Farmers' Market, near the Brooklyn Flea Market and the relaxing Pratt School of Design Sculpture Garden. There are a variety of restaurants in the neighborhood, which added to our enjoyment.  The apartment is as described---very clean and well  appointed. 
[QWERTY123]Très bonne première expérience avec Airbnb. Bon accueil de Blaise avec des explications claires et mise à disposition intégrale de l'appartement. Le descriptif correspond parfaitement, confortable, salle de bain privée, propre et look design. Brooklyn est le cartier qui monte à NY l'appartement est à 15 minutes du pont qui est un incontournable a faire.[QWERTY123]Blaise is a great host and the flat was great. Located close to the tubes and in a great neighbourhood in Brooklyn with loads of cafes, groceries close by and good access to Manhattan. Blaise was flexible with our check in time which we couldn't be more grateful for . His flat is comfortable and much bigger than the places we stayed in Manhattan which was great. He was very helpful to give us information about the area and places to check nearby. We had a great stay and I would recommend him if you like a good place to stay I. Brooklyn.[QWERTY123]Nous remercions Blaise pour son accueil. Nous avons passé un tes bon séjour à Brooklyn. L appartement est magnifique.
Merci pour tout.[QWERTY123]La casa esta muy bien ubicada en Brooklyn. La conexión para coger el metro y el bus están muy cerca. Vivienda confortable con baño completo para los huespedes.El sistema de calefacción excelente, y habitación con cama de matrimonio y armario para dejar las cosas.
Recomiendo la casa de Blaise, pues es un chico educado y formal.[QWERTY123]Blaise's stunning apartment was a highlight of our trip to NYC. It is conveniently located, close to several subway stations and the neighbourhood also has plenty of options for dinner. The connections to Manhattan are good, even late at night. Blaise was a extremely helpful host and he made us feel very welcome. We would stay at his place again when we return to New York.[QWERTY123]Blaise est vraiment très gentil, discret, et de bons conseils .
Son appartement est spacieux, charmant et accueillant .
Idéal si l'on veut couper de l'immensité de Manhattan à la fin de la journée ! 
[QWERTY123]Blaise was a very friendly helping host and it's easy to feel home at his wonderful and spacious appartment. It was so comfortable that we even enjoyed a rainy day at home. I can really recommend this place with a gorgeous terrace on the roof. Thank you so much, Blaise![QWERTY123]My husband and I had an excellent stay in New York, and are grateful to Blaise for being such a helpful and congenial host. We enjoyed meeting him and being his guests. He was very generous with information that made the success of our trip possible - - answered our tons of questions, provided maps and even helped my husband with an app that enabled  us to  navigate our way through Manhattan and Brooklyn. 

This was our first stay in Brooklyn, (we’d stayed in Manhattan on previous visits), and we loved the quiet neighborhood feel of the location on the park. We found it convenient to public transportation that provided an easy rides into Manhattan, and we had no problem with street parking our car. 

 Blaise’s place was very clean and comfortable…and gorgeous besides. We used the kitchen quite a bit  - - found it modern, immaculate and well-equipped. Blaise made sure we had places to keep our own food and we felt right at home there. The bedroom was not large, but quite comfortable, and we slept well. There was plenty of storage room for our large quantity of stuff (we’d driven, and did NOT travel light!), and there were plenty of shelves. The bathroom was bright and clean with room for toiletries, and we had all the of fluffy towels we could want.

We would like to stay there with Blaise when we visit New York again![QWERTY123]Très bel appartement, super bien placé dans un quartier très agréable et  bien plus calme que la tournoyante et magnifique Manhattan! Merci à Blaise de proposer ce ""petit"" havre de paix à ce prix là !!""[QWERTY123]Blaise was a very welcome host with a lovely apartment, in a fantastic location. The pictures don't even do the space justice- it is gorgeous and impeccably maintained! Blaise was very accommodating and we really appreciated his thoughtfulness. We highly recommend this place![QWERTY123]Mycket ren och fräsch lägenhet, beskrivningen stämde bra på verkligheten. Blaise var trevlig och tillmötesgående. Kan rekommendera andra att bo här![QWERTY123]we had a very pleasent stay. the appartement is really amazing, the room and bath are charming and very clean. the neighbourhood around fort green park has a lot of good bars and restaurants. especially, the metro connections to manhattan or wherever in new york are just superbe. we would stay there again. its the perfect location to explore new york.[QWERTY123]We really enjoyed our stay in Blaise's apartment. Clean and comfortable room and bathroom within nice location. Definitely worth to consider for those who are planing to visit New York city.[QWERTY123]L'appartement est idealement situé dans Brooklyn, a distance égale de deux stations de métro qui desservent les lignes principales pour visiter Manathan. 
Chambre confortable avec placards, la salle de bains réservée est un vrai plus et le quartier est très calme (ideal apres une bonne journee de marche).
Blaise est très sympathique, c'est la première fois que nous tentions l'expérience ""chambre privée"" et nous n'avons pas été déçus.[QWERTY123]Beautiful, comfertable place to stay. At 10-15 minutes walk from metro station. Really nice to have your own, good, bathroom.
We didn't see or speak to the host much, but he let us check out late which was perfect for our plans. No breakfast included. We would recommend a stay here for a New York trip![QWERTY123]Die Wohnung war großartig und sehr gepflegt! Unser Zimmer bot ausreichend Platz für Gepäck und Kleidung und war ebenfalls gemütlich und sauber. Blaise ist sympathisch und hilfsbereit, wenn Fragen oder Probleme auftauchen sollten. Die Lage der Wohnung ist einfach perfekt - per U-Bahn ist Manhattan schnell zu erreichen und um die Ecke sind einige gute Restaurants. Brooklyn lässt sich von hier aus sehr gut erkunden. Fazit: Jederzeit wieder![QWERTY123]Blaise has an absolutely stunning pad, with a gorgeous private bathroom, and with easy access to the subway. The surrounding neighborhood is really special as well, including the best coffee shop my girlfriend and I have ever enjoyed. Blaise was a fantastic host. You won't regret staying here. (p.s. the coffee shop is Urban Vintage)[QWERTY123]The place was really nice and eclectic. We loved the high ceilings and the decor. The guest bathroom was great, but not attached to the room, which meant it wasn't exactly ""private"". However, it was clean and looked recently remodeled.  

The bedroom was as described with one window that let the morning light in.  Unfortunately the room simply lacked the character that the rest of the house had. The only other issue was that the room shared a common wall with the master, which also limited privacy. Overall it worked well and the price was right. The apartment fronted a park and was located right around the corner from a main street that had a bunch of good restaurants and shops. 

Blaise was accommodating with our schedule and helped us out where he could.[QWERTY123]Merci beaucoup!

Tout était parfait: logement conforme aux photos, très spacieux.
Hote très accueillant, à la fois discret et disponible
Merci encore![QWERTY123]Nuestra estancia ha sido perfecta en todos los aspectos. La casa esta situada en un barrio muy agradable cerca de varias lineas de metro. La casa es genial y Blaise muy amable con sus huéspedes. Muchas gracias!!![QWERTY123]Our stay was great, very nice and clean apartment. Located in a pleasant, quiet and very close to several subway stations neighborhood. Blaise & Eric have been very friendly. Definitely recommend the place. Thank you Blaise!
[QWERTY123]We had a lovely stay at Blaise's apartment. The apartment itself was fantastic. Very spacious, cosy, clean, view on the park and everything you need.  Including the kitchen we could use (and a great roof terrace). The private bathroom was a big plus. Blaise is very helpful and kind. We could recommend his place to everyone. Really![QWERTY123]Blaise was a wonderful host, even though we unfortunately didn't have a chance to meet in person.  He was easy to get a hold of, and great at communicating before and during our stay.  

His apartment is phenomenal - tons of space, a cool roof deck, comfy bed, wonderful modern bathroom, and incredible location.  Fort Greene is a great neighborhood to explore, and Blaise's place right on the park is the perfect home base to explore it from.

Thanks for a great stay, Blaise![QWERTY123]THE SIXTH STAR ..................If the rating system allowed six stars,  this apartment directly on Fort Greene Park would easily win the accolade !!!!!  Blaise and Ben have much better taste than me when it comes to interior design and the entire space is immaculate, sleek, and comfortable. We felt ""at home"" in the first thirty seconds.  From the flowered rooftop deck with the friendly feral cat, to the gourmet kitchen that would make even Martha Stewart happy to be out of the slammer, to the well appointed living space with Wi-Fi and HDTV ---- the whole place screams  ""I Love Brooklyn"" ----- and we did !!! Thanks for a great stay. We will be back -- hoping that a six star rating doesn't mess up the whole 'availability thing' !!!![QWERTY123]L'appartement de Blaise est idéalement placé, dans le calme de Brooklyn et proche de toutes les lignes de métro, de restaurants et espaces verts. Blaise et Ben sont disponibles, de bon conseil, accueillants et restent discrets. Les plus : la salle de bain privative juste à côté de la chambre, la literie, la propreté et la terrasse sur les toits très agréable![QWERTY123]Beautiful and very clean apartment. Everything was great. Only 10 minutes walk to the subway. Every word in description is truth and the reality was even better. Highly, highly recommend![QWERTY123]Blaises place is incredible, the perfect retreat in Brooklyn. It was a really peaceful house on the top level with a great rooftop for having breakfast in the sun. The house is in an excellent neighbourhood with loads of funky cafes and restaurants close by. Blaise and Ben were super welcoming and helpful and made visiting a new city super easy. Thanks so much guys, we had a blast![QWERTY123]Great apartment, great neigbourhood. Good to come back to Fort Greene after a long day in the City.[QWERTY123]Descriptif tout à fait conforme à la réalité. Blaise a rénové son appartement avec beaucoup de goût. Très spacieux, fonctionnel, le confort à l'américaine ! la chambre est plus simple mais largement suffisante pour son utilisation et la salle de bain privée (non attenante) est un vrai plus ! Quartier idéal pour se reposer après une journée de marche.  L'appart est très très calme. Le parc situé juste en face est très agréable, c'est le rendez vous des chiens (et de leur maître). Plusieurs épiceries à proximité, notamment Greene ville garden. 2 stations de métro pour accéder rapidement à Manhattan, et un petit 1/4 à pied pour rejoindre l'un des 2 ponts, Brooklyn et Manhattan Bridge avec une forte préférence pour le premier qui vous permet d'arriver face au City Hall et offre une vue splendide sur la ""skyline"". Bref, un sans faute, je recommande vivement les lieux ![QWERTY123]Estuvimos muy a gusto, Blaise y Ben son correctos y están receptivos ante cualquier necesidad o duda. La casa es estupenda y esa zona de Brooklyn es tranquila y agradable, con lo necesario y bien comunicada. Si regreso a Nueva York, no dudaría en volver allí.[QWERTY123]Blaise's apartment is beautiful and conveniently located. The room is modestly sized but very comfortable for two. We had a wonderful stay and Blaise was very welcoming and helpful. Would highly recommend![QWERTY123]This was such a great vacation and not only for a small part because of that lovely accommodation. We loved to stay at Blaise's beautiful home. It was everything that was promised. We especially loved hanging out on the big roof terrace with a wonderful view (even a little over Manhattan) and a lovely cat.
I would recommend the accommodation to everyone and would love to come back there myself some time. Thanks Blaise and Ben![QWERTY123]Blaise et Ben son des hôtes super accueillants, prêts à rendre service et discrets.  Réserver chez eux c'est accéder à un duplex très stylé, de part la décoration et de la disposition. Nous avons eu accès à toutes les parties de l'appartement (sauf leur chambre évidement) ce qui est un plus. La terrasse sur le toit et la salle de bain privée sont un vrai plus. La chambre est simple et suffit largement pour y être bien à deux personnes.

Le quartier est proche de toutes les commodités, un parc rempli d'écureuils, le métro, une station de citybike et beaucoup de shops de proximité sont accessibles à pied.

Pour une trentaine d'euros un taxi vous fera la course de JFK.

[QWERTY123]Blaize and Ben were perfect hosts, making us welcome in their charming and very spacious home.  They made the whole house available, were generous with assistance and local knowledge but also allowed us space and privacy.  Having a private bathroom and access to the loft living space gave us a home-away-from-home feeling.  The location of their apartment is very convenient to shops and the subway and the neighbourhood was relaxed and friendly.  We also enjoyed our conversations with them about American lifestyle.  Thanks boys for your kindness and hospitality.[QWERTY123]My girlfriend and I spent 5 days at Blaise's place. Blaise was really helpful and reachable all the time. The house is amazing, we felt really confortable and we were able to rest perfectly. The subway is 10-15 minutes away and have good connections with Manhattan. The neighborhood is safe and with many services around. It was an incredible experience, one that we recommend.[QWERTY123]Would stay again! Blaise and Ben were great hosts. They are friendly, helpful and respected our space in their home. Their home is clean and inviting. The private bedroom was quiet, and the private bathroom in the hallway was a great perk. Made breakfast in the large kitchen before departing every morning, and made dinner in a couple of nights. Great proximity to subway stations, local restaurants and within walking distance of Brooklyn Bridge and Manhattan. Thank you for providing a great home base for a wonderful trip.[QWERTY123]This place is perfect - away from the hectic Manhattan, but very close to public transit and you only need to ride 2 stops to get to lower Manhattan (or you can even walk across Manhattan bridge and enjoy the skyline view). Close to grocery stores (which is great, because Blaise has a really nice big kitchen) and restaurants. I had work to do every day, so I appreciated the fast and reliable wi-fi. Bed is big enough for two and very cozy and you also get your own private bathroom, which is really nice. You get your own set of keys for the place, which is great, and rest assured they work - I wasn't sure I got the right keys when I first arrived back, because you have to force the key for outside doors a bit and I was afraid I was going to break the key, but once I got the hang of it it was easy. This place is perfect when you want to explore Manhattan and Brooklyn and feel at home.[QWERTY123]Great hosts and amazing home. Within walking distance to most subway stations in Brooklyn. Lots of restaurants  around the neighborhood.[QWERTY123]Blaise's place is incredibly well decorated. It is on the top floor of a beautiful brownstone apartment overlooking fort green park. This place is the cleanest Airbnb I have ever stayed at.[QWERTY123]Blaise and Ben were great hosts - they shared their great apartment so generously that we never felt like we were intruding. An excellent first Airbnb experience.[QWERTY123]L'appartement est parfaitement conforme à la description, bien décoré et fonctionnel. Nous avons pu profiter de la cuisine et des espaces communs. Le quartier est très calme mais proche des commerces, restaurants et transports en commun, Manhattan est à moins de 30 minutes. La chambre et la salle de bain sont bien équipées, confortables et très propres. Merci encore à Blaise pour son accueil et ses conseils.[QWERTY123]Blaise and Ben are wonderful hosts. Their openess and hospitality made us want to stay longer than a week! The appartment is really amazing. Very clean, spaceous and simply beautiful. The location is also great-a green and quiet area of Brooklyn, yet close to everything you may need, including great restaurants, bars and stores. We can definitely recommend Blaise and Ben as hosts![QWERTY123]Blaise and Ben's apartment was beautiful. All the rooms have so much charme. We totally loved the decoration which was with lots of prints. The place is as the downloaded pictures. 
The place is really good located. The closest station is by 10 mins walk and you can go to the Lower Manhattan with the B train in 20 minutes. From the airport, we took an Uber and we paid around 40$. 

On Monday the house keeper came and she did not bother us at all. She was pretty nice! 

Ben and Blaise planed something when we booked the place and at the end, Ben stayed home to welcome us. Thank you again!! 

We would definitely come back to this place and we have nothing negative to say.[QWERTY123]Amazing apartment, clean, very nicely decorated with a lot of personality. The location is great because it allows you to discover Brooklyn but be close to Manhattan as well. Very quiet too. 

Blaise and Ben were welcoming and we had a great time.[QWERTY123]This is a perfect home to stay in New York, position is strategic because with a couple of subway stops you are in Manhattan but you don't have the chaos of the city, it's very peaceful (and a trendy area too for bars and shopping). If you are sporty people, it's nice going running in the neighborhood, you have a park just right in front of the appartment and you are close to Brooklyn bridge Park. 
Host are wonderful people, very kind and discrete. The room is nice and clear, you have your own bathroom. Best choice![QWERTY123]The apartment is great: cozy, greatly decorated, perfectly clean, and in a strategic position. We spent one week there and we really enjoyed our stay. Ben and Blaise are two perfect hosts, nice and discrete. Go there if you want to discover NY and have a cool location waiting for you at the end of the day :-)[QWERTY123]Nice stay. Very nice guys![QWERTY123]Blaise and Ben were fantastic hosts. We could come and go as we pleased, but they were always very easy to contact if we needed anything. The room has a big comfy bed and a lovely big window with lots of storage space, and the private bathroom is great. We were especially grateful for the nespresso coffee machine in the kitchen to aid our jetlag! The whole flat is beautifully furnished, and on the prettiest street we saw in Brooklyn, overlooking fort greene park. It is a short walk to lots of delicious brunch cafes and restaurants (Smooch and Olea were our favourite) , and not far to a choice of subway stops/lines. Thank you! We would certainly stay again and have already recommended the apartment to friends.[QWERTY123]Immeuble rénové il y a une dizaine d'années, logement décoré avec goût, bonne communication avec Blaise et Ben, environnement socialement contrasté (notamment entre Dekalb Avenue et Myrtle Avenue), un réseau de bus permettant de rejoindre facilement les quartiers voisins (Williamsburg) ainsi que le métro, et donc Manhattan, les plages ...[QWERTY123]We had a great stay! Extremely nice apt with lovely amenities.  Highly recommended.[QWERTY123]The perfect place to stay in NY. Fort Greene is a lovely neighborhood, we enjoyed the position and the beautiful room and private bathroom of Blaise and Ben's amazing house. Mention of honor: the NY Lego street built on the fireplace. I want definitely to suggest this beautiful airbnb to all my friends.[QWERTY123]Ben and Blaise have a real gem of a place that is located in a very quiet but trendy neighborhood in Brooklyn. Bars and restaurants are close by, as is the subway into town. We enjoyed our stay immensely, since the apartment just took our breath away and our hosts were always friendly and helpful. The perfect place to get some rest after a busy day in Manhattan.[QWERTY123]Blaise and Ben are very welcoming and hospitable guys, yet unassuming. The apartment is cozy and spacious, especially the roof terrace is nice. The room is big enough for two. Quiet street, however lots of restaurants and bars in walking distance. Perfect to discover Brooklyn and Manhattan. We would stay there again.[QWERTY123]We can highly recommend Blaise and Ben's place! 
We are a couple in our thirties- we were visiting friends in NYC but wanted our own space in the city. A friend recommended their apartment - she stayed there a couple of years ago.

The apartment is very spacious and clean - perfect for heading out to Manhattan or Williamsburg or Brooklyn Heights / Dumbo and the southern hoods of Brooklyn - it's in a good location to hop on various public transport lines.
There are some good Restaurants and Breakfast places nearby. The neighborhood is safe, but it is NYC so just be smart. We as a couple for example did not walk through fort Greene park late at night.

We had our own private room with enough space for our suitcases, clean comfy sheets and a window you can even open, even though the whole place has central air conditioning. 
Additionally we had our own private bathroom: super clean, soft towels, big rainshower. 
The whole place is a duplex and super spacious - they put some much effort furnishing it with care and thought.

We were mostly out and about town visiting people, but it was super relaxing to know that we have that room / apt as our base there. 

Blaise and Ben were very friendly, calm and the communication beforehand und during our stay was quick, helpful and relaxed. There was no drama at all. 
They were out for work in the mornings when we woke up and came back before we came back late at night. 
We tried to be quite and hope they enjoyed having us as their guests! We will recommend their place![QWERTY123]Really beautiful apartment. Full furnished. great attention to the details of the house and veary clean.
Me and my wife spent here a period of vacation and we found Blaise and Ben two great hosts. Brooklyn offers you lots of cool spots, restaurants and bars. Less than ten minutes walking from subway stations to get downtown.[QWERTY123]All was perfect in our stay in Blaise’s place. The house is gorgeous and very clean too. Both Blaise and Ben have been at all time helpful and friendly.[QWERTY123]Fantastic place to stay. 
Close to all amenities.
You couldn’t get better hosts than Blaise and Ben.[QWERTY123]Très bonne adresse![QWERTY123]Blaise and Ben were both very friendly. Also, they provided clear answers and great suggestions whenever I had a question. The aparment is huge and nicely furnished. It’s a big plus that there’s a separate bathroom for guests only. I enjoyed the neighbourhood as well, and there are a lot of great restaurants nearby. Could not have wished for a better place to stay![QWERTY123]Comfortable, quiet, clean, and beautiful place right next to Fort Greene Park. Amazing kitchen and comfortable living room to hangout. We loved this place and the hosts are super nice and accomodating.[QWERTY123]Fabulous location very handy to all things Brooklyn.  If you want to get a taste of living US style in a cool suburban location this is it.[QWERTY123]The place is close to metro stop. Very nice view of the city and park. I would definitely book this place again.[QWERTY123]Tolle Wohnung in guter Lage in Brooklyn, Besonderheit: Dachterrasse, Klimaanlage, sehr schöne Renovierung. Spannende Gegend, gute Restaurants, in 10 Minuten zu public transport, mehrere Linien, kurze Distanz nach Manhattan.[QWERTY123]This is a really exceptional apartment.  The location is lovely - in the heart of Fort Greene, and overlooking the park.  Everything in the apartment is to a very high standard, and the roof terrace is a great bonus.  The room is very attractive and comfortable, with a good bed, a good blackout blind (important for jet-lagged European visitors) and the bathroom has an excellent shower.  A state-of-the-art air con system makes the apartment very comfortable in hot weather.   Blaise and Ben were very pleasant and friendly, and I also had the added bonus of having the apartment to myself over the weekend.[QWERTY123]Blaise's apartment is stylish and includes everything you could need. It's in a great location opposite Fort Greene part and close to excellent restaurants and to the subway. Our room was lovely and it was great having sole us of a bathroom. Blaise and Ben were always helpful, ready with information and generous with their home.[QWERTY123]Nous avons passé un excellent séjour dans l'appartement de Blaise et Ben qui sont des hôtes très accueillants. Très bonne communication avec Blaise avant l'arrivée. L'appartement est conforme à la présentation. La chambre est propre et fonctionnelle. La salle de bain privative est un vrai plus. Nous avons pu utiliser la cuisine pour le petit déjeuner et le dîner le soir en rentrant. L'immeuble est très calme. Plusieurs stations de métro à 10 mn de marche permettent de relier Manhattan rapidement. Brooklyn est à découvrir. On apprécie son calme après une journée de visite à Manhattan. Merci Blaise et Ben pour votre accueil.[QWERTY123]This apartment is stupendous, a beautiful brownstone overlooking a park in a great part of Brooklyn. The interior is stunningly decorated and furnished. Absolute joy to spend time there and 5-10 minutes from subways taking you all over NYC. Can not recommend highly enough![QWERTY123]The apartment is very well located and faces a nice park in Brooklyn. The apartment is very well furnished and was entirely clean. Both hosts were very welcoming.[QWERTY123]Blaise and Ben are the perfect hosts. Their place is great and right in the middle of a superb neighborhood. Enough privacy thanks to the guest bathroom.[QWERTY123]My sister and I had a great time staying at Blaise’s place in New York. The location was great, right across the street from the park, very close to great restaurants in Fort Greene, and close to the train stations.  Their apartment was beautiful and the extra room was perfect for two people. Would definitely recommend to stay here![QWERTY123]Notre voyage à NY s'est très bien déroulé chez Blaise. 
Le logement est bien situé à 30 min du centre de Manhattan par le métro. De nombreux commerces et resto à proximité. 
Le logement est très calme Et en face d'un parc tres agréable.

Blaise Et Ben ont été très disponibles pour nous mais aussi discrets, arrangeants sur les horaires et nous ont fait confiance. 

L'appartement est magnifique Et très propre. Avec tous les équipements nécessaires ( serviettes de toilette, sèche cheveux ..)

Alina really went out of her way to make our stay enjoyable, and if I get a week in New York again anytime soon we'd love to stay again!
The location is perfect with amazing restaurants around every corner.  Highly recommend!  Thanks again Alina.[QWERTY123]Loved our stay here. Cute and clean apartment in a really great location! Thanks Alina![QWERTY123]We stayed at Alina's apartment in West Village and it was just perfect. The apartment was bright and very clean (full provided kitchen and wifi). The location is ideal if you want to visit cultural places (close to the Chelsea's galleries), to go out and listen live music or shopping.[QWERTY123]Nice convenient apartment! With a lot of good restaurants nearby!
We've enjoyed the stay!
Thanks Alina![QWERTY123]We had a fantastic stay at the Bleecker Street apartment. It was well located, in a beautiful part of NYC, a good size, very clean and had everything we needed. Alina was great to deal with, really friendly, helpful and flexible with our travel plans. BIG THANKS :)[QWERTY123]Alinas apartment, in the greatest location for a visitor to NY. Bleecker St is just gorgeous and we often found it took all day to just leave the immediate area as there are so many beautiful shops, cafes bars on beautiful tree lines streets. We liked the apartment as it was clean and sparse as; as a visitor staying in someones apartment I didn't want to be surrounded by their personal belongings! Having a well equipped kitchen was really useful for us. Bathroom was nice with lots of hot water, and nice fresh towels and sheets. It is up 5 flights of stairs, which after all day sightseeing sometimes we cursed BUT we got super fit! We had a really great time and I would highly recommend the apartment[QWERTY123]We had a wonderful 3 weeks honeymoon staying in Alina's fab West Village apartment. Bleecker St is a dream location with cafes and restaurants just seconds away as well as great boutiques. Also very near the subway so perfectly placed for exploring the city. The apartment is towards the north western end of Bleecker so you also get the benefit of it being relatively quiet in the evenings as there are mainly retail units below...
The apartment is very light and airy (although be warned it's on the 5th floor but it's worth the climb)and benefits from WiFi and much appreciated air-conditioning (it was 30 degrees most of the time we we there!) There is a well equipped kitchen, great shower and plenty of closet space.
Alina was a really friendly, helpful host (although we never met!) and provided us with all the advice and instructions we needed to make the rental go smoothly... We loved NYC especially the chilled out vibe of Greenwich Village. We definitely plan to return![QWERTY123]Alina's place was fantastic! Alina was wonderful to work with, organized, responsive, and thoughtful. My fiancée and I loved every minute we were at the apartment.  The location was 5 stars. The apartment was clean, open, neatly appointed without the feel of crashing in someone else's pad. Top floor, 5 story walk up, no problem for two San Franciscans. Plenty of light, air conditioner was great. We were able to walk to all the spots we had hoped for.  My fiancée visited all the boutiques in the neighborhood and shopped like there was no tomorrow. At the end of the day, coming home to Alina's place was like coming home to our own, we were that comfortable. After this experience, we are planning more trips to NYC (Website hidden by Airbnb)[QWERTY123]Our stay at Alina's for Christmas 2010 was everything we wanted it to be.

Being our first experience on Airbnb we were slightly nervous, but the entire stay went without a hitch. We were in New York for Christmas and New Year, and this was made all the better by having a nice, clean apartment in a good location to return home to at night. The subway (2 stations) are within 5 minutes walk, and we recommend Washington Square diner for a great breakfast to start your day.

Collecting and dropping off keys was simple, the internet is very fast and reliable, and there was even a new flat screen TV which we weren't expecting. Alina was easy to contact both before and during our stay, and even purchased some tickets on our behalf for the New York Knicks, helping to make our holiday all the better by going above and beyond her duties as out host. Thank you!

The only drawback is lugging 2 suitcases up 5 flights of stairs, but you only do this twice, and isn't too bad.

Couldn't ask for more.[QWERTY123]The most wonderful stay in the West Village. The apt is exactly as pictured  and it is located in the heart of the Village amid all the buzz. It is light, well proportioned and there is lots of space for storage etc. The five flights of stairs make for a good workout as well. This place is a true nest and I would stay here again in a heart beat. It's a gem! I recommend it highly Alina was an absolutely wonderful host and available for any queries and/or assistance. She was a delight.[QWERTY123]I stayed at the apartment for a month - was such a fantastic location   - really enjoyed strolling the charming streets of the West VIllage and was surrounded by great restaurants, bars, and shops. Also close to subway stops. 

Alina was a great host - very friendly, easy to approach and quick to respond to any of my queries.[QWERTY123]Alina's apartment is amazing and was the perfect home for a cozy winter week in the West Village.  She has taken the time to outfit this place with all the amenities you would need and the location cannot be beat.  My favorite part of this apartment is the cozy little bedroom with a window looking out onto Bleecker Street.  The bed is super comfy and the white linens make you feel so peaceful.  Overall, I would definitely stay here again and would recommend this place to anyone looking for a cute and comfortable WV nest in the heart of NYC.  Thanks Alina![QWERTY123]Alina was responsive and helpful throughout the booking process and the rental period. I stayed in the apartment for 2 months. It is well located in the West Village which was super convenient for getting uptown to all the major sites. I preferred to stay downtown exploring the village, East Village, SoHo and NoHo. 
The apartment is well decorated and has everything you need. Thought has been given to the smaller details and Alina went as far as a welcome card and flowers. This was really special after travelling such as distance. 
Really clean with extra linen and towels provided made it easy. 
Alina also went out of her way to provide details of local services.[QWERTY123]I stayed at Alina's for 8 weeks as I was doing a short course in NY!

What a wonderful spot! The location is insane, in the middle of awesome restaurants and bars! 

Absolutely loved staying there... So cute and homely!

Alina was absolutely amazing! So thoughtful and made my trip a breeze! 

Would highly recommend her flat! 

Thanks again Alina for a fantastic trip! Felt so sad leaving today, it really felt like home ;)

[QWERTY123]Questa per me e' stata la prima esperienza utilizzando airbnb, ed e' stata molto bella
sono stato in questo appartamento per quasi 3 mesi,l'appartamento e' molto carino da come si puo vedere nelle foto, piccolo ma pratico, posizione davvero bella all'interno del west village, una delle zone piu' cool di tutta nyc. vicino a molti ristoranti, bar e negozi. ed anche  vicino alle fermate della metropolitana. Alina e' stata molto gentile e di aiuto,per qualsiasi mia domanda  e veloce nel rispondere a tutte le mie domande.
consiglio vivamente questo appartamento.
bellissima esperienza.
[QWERTY123]Apartment is in a fabulous location. Guests should be prepared for consistent street noise and the fact that this apartment is a walk up involving several flights of stairs. Also, the building is pre-war, which means there is an older, somewhat loud radiator for heat. Plenty of blankets and towels were provided, as well as some handy items like a space heater. Given the items already in the apartment, space is fairly limited for the belongings of guests who may be staying for longer periods. The host was responsive about answering questions and concerns.[QWERTY123]Great place[QWERTY123]The location is terrific. The Village really is a village and you can have an uncommonly quiet and intimate experience in this neighborhood. You will find 'favorite' places; innumerable restaurants and shops, as well as easy access to transportation. It is an apartment that looks onto Bleecker Street so there is noise! I tuned it out and slept well there. It is a clean and efficient apartment without a lot of frills and that suited me just fine![QWERTY123]Beautiful apartment in an absolutely perfect location in the West Village. Alina was very responsive when needed or just needed questions answered. Apartment is well appointed and is a great place for a long term stay. Highly recommended.[QWERTY123]I can't recommend this place & host enough! Perfect location on a main street however still a quiet feeling. Close to everything you need amongst a popular neighbourhood. Alina was a good communicator and very accommodating. You will love your stay here![QWERTY123]Alina's apartment is perfect. Perfect location, clean, and very easy to check in/check out of. 

Thanks so much!![QWERTY123]Great place. An old building adds extra charm. The best, though, is the area. Alina was very responsive.[QWERTY123]Alina’s place is fantastic. Great location and the nice end of the street. Close to everything! It’s quite spacious for what it is and well maintained. It’s on the 5th floor with no lift. No problem for me, but some might not like this. I’ll stay again if I can.[QWERTY123]I lived in Alina's apartment for a few months and it was a perfect fit for me. As I explored New York I really felt I was living in the best location - clean, quiet and chic. The apartment was just as photographed  and had a great  energy  as soon as I arrived. Alina was such a great host.  I always felt comfortable contacting her with any questions I had and she always got back to me ASAP. I really felt at home in her apartment and was sad to leave it.  I look forward to staying there again in the future![QWERTY123]Alina's apartment was spacious, clean, and in a great location -- just as advertised! Alina is responsive and considerate host. You won't regret staying here!"	40.735304677395206	-74.00524659134572	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/6090	1	175.0	0.7
36	6848	"Stayed with Allen and Irina about a year ago. The apartment was more spacious than we thought it would be. They were helpful and nice when we needed that, and left us alone when we needed that too. The location is pretty good, not that far a walk into Williamsburg/hipsterville, and not that far into Manhattan either. We enjoyed our stay![QWERTY123]Irina was very welcoming and the apt was comfortable and felt very homely and clean. We had an amazing time in NY and hope to visit again, Thank you Mimi & Neale[QWERTY123]This apartment was perfect for our stay in NY this past weekend. Very comfortable, easy parking, and very gracious hosts. Thank you so much! I'm sure we'll be back.[QWERTY123]Allen and Irena were simply wonderful hosts and great ambassadors to New York and Brooklyn.   They let us keep our bags in the apartment before check-in and were very easy to communicate with.    They provided us with a map of the area with local stuff like laundry, restaurants, etc.   The apartment itself was very spacious as far as New York goes -- a room that size would normally be hundreds of dollars a night.   Very close to trains and within a mile of Bedford Ave.   Just a really nice place and really nice people.   Thanks so much.  Highly recommended.[QWERTY123]It's everything Mike M said & more. Allen & Irina are such great people, it felt more like staying with friends than renting a room from strangers. The kitchen has whatever you might need to cook your own meals (but there are too many great places to eat out at that it's a challenge to try to do so). The breakfast goodies provided in the fridge were great & helped us start our day earlier so we could keep exploring. The location was perfect. My friends were skeptical when I said I was staying in Brooklyn to visit NYC, but it was so quick & easy to get to Manhattan every day. I also felt safe coming home late at night. I wouldn't have done anything differently, except book a longer vacation![QWERTY123]Great place, friendly people, had everything we needed and more! Thanks Irina and Allen :)[QWERTY123]The basics: Clean, nice, home-away-from-home feeling.  Safe neighborhood, few-frills but many comforts way to visit NYC. I'd stay here again in a heartbeat.  

Details on my experience: This was my first time using AirBnB, and I thought that it was a great experience.  I've already recommended the site to many friends, and will use it again. My sister's family used it simultaneously, and my brother and I stayed at Allen and Irina's place while she stayed at one of the Hotel Toshi properties.  We were both very happy with our stays, but I think that I got the better deal.

Allen and Irina were *extremely* proactive communicators, confirming dates and arrival times and printing out neighborhood maps with recommended restaurants.  Allen had a parking space right outside the front door, which he gave to me for unloading (my initial spot was 1.5 blocks away - safe, free parking is easily found nearby).  Both were very concerned about making sure we had everything we wanted, and freely offered info, but they never felt intrusive. Helpful, friendly and truly concerned with ensuring we enjoyed ourselves - some of the best customer service ever!

The place itself was really nice. Brooklyn on somewhat of a budget nice, not W hotel nice, but I liked it better than my stay at the Waldorf Astoria several years back. Bigger rooms, fridge and pantry spare but stocked with breakfast essentials, bathroom built for tall people (I'm 6'2"" and my brother is 6'4"" and neither of us had to do the usual ducking for showerheads or sink mirror).  Also, they provided way more clean towels, blankets, etc than we might ever need, and everything looked and felt very clean. Seriously, getting this space at this price was great!

The negatives:
Our last night there, wireless internet went out.  Out of their control, as they lost their residential phone, internet & cable upstairs (as usual, TWC sucks) and they obviously wanted it fixed more than we did.  The TV in the room (as I saw in the photos) was a very small oldschool TV/VCR combo - not a problem for me but perhaps for others.  The apartment is obviously furnished by people rather than by IKEA, which I prefer but some may not like.  

Overall, I'm glad we stayed here rather than one of the Hotel Toshi properties, which have nicer stuff (big flatscreen TV's, ultramodern furnishings) but require dealing with a more corporate machine type of customer service (separate building for check-in, sub-par customer service, maids rushing you to leave so they can clean, etc).  Anyone wishing to contact me for more details is welcome to do so.  Thanks Allen and Irina![QWERTY123]Good deal for Brooklyn. Clean, AC, Irina let us arrive early in the morning after an overnight flight. 
Overall recommended[QWERTY123]The place was perfect for my birthday weekend. I've lived in Manhattan and wanted to explore Brooklyn and everything that interested me was proximate and easy (and it would have been a breeze to see Manhattan from this location as well.) The amenities themselves were wonderful (I was won over when I saw my favorite hair dryer in the bathroom, but the bed was comfy, the rooms were spacious, the place was overall a phenomenal deal.) I hope I left everything clean enough because I'd be delighted to stay again! Thanks![QWERTY123]We stayed 3 nights with our two kids (13 and 17). the place is very warm and comfort, and so are Irina and Allen.[QWERTY123]Un appartement à 5 minutes du metro et seulement à deux arret de Manhattan.
3 jours inoubliable à New York!
Merci[QWERTY123]We stayed only a (too) short weekend. It was really nice. This was our first experience with airbnb and I can just tell everyone, that it was awesome.

The place was so cozy and we felt at home immediately. It had all we needed. I would even recommend this place for more than 2 people, if you are ok with sharing a place. 

Irina was a really nice host. She opened the door with a big smile and showed us everything. 

It is only a short walk to a lot of restaurants and bars and you are in Manhattan very quickly using the Subway. 

Thank you very much, Irina.

[QWERTY123]Loved the location and the apartment was clean and tidy and a perfect size for the two of us.  Irina was a great host, leaving us with essentials when we first arrived.  Would definetely recommend the apartment.[QWERTY123]We had a great stay. We accidentally arrived a little early, but Irina was very accommodating. The place was clean, plenty of sheets and blankets, even OJ in the fridge. We didn't meet Allen, but Irina couldn't have been more helpful.[QWERTY123]The apartment was wonderfully furnished and very well stocked. The location couldn't have been better for us and Irina & Allen were easy to communicate with and were very accommodating.[QWERTY123]the apartment was well-stocked and irina & allen were very accommodating. appreciated the complimentary milk, OJ, and coffee![QWERTY123]It was our first time using AirBnB and it couldn't have been any better. Allen and Irina are great hosts, very nice and helpful. 
We stayed in both apartments and absolutely loved it.Very clean and cozy, great locations.
Hope to go back soon. Thank you for everything, Irina & Allen![QWERTY123]Excellent location,Great apt & very nice people.[QWERTY123]hiya, we loved the williamsburg apartment, it was just perfect for what we wanted - as mentioned, great transport links & close access to manhattan & rest of brooklyn too; we loved the interesting features & fittings too - even better than the pics! irina made us feel very welcome on arrival & they answered any q's we had with no bother, and great local suggestions for food etc - we'd love to come stay again one day!
[QWERTY123]We love New York! This was our 8th trip and we were very comfortable. Our daughter lives in Brooklyn so this was perfect for us. Irina and Allen were great hosts and it's a great apartment. We look forward to returning next year. Dick & Carol McGrane[QWERTY123]Allen and Irina were very responsive, extremely friendly and such a pleasure to deal with.  The apartment is clean and in great condition.  Overall, the experience could not have been any better.[QWERTY123]I stayed at Allen and Irinas apartment with my boyfriend and his 9 year old daughter. We were happy to stay there. It fit perfectly for the three of us and was nice and very clean! We enjoyed the free netflix account at night. The apartment is close to the subway and several restaurants and cafes are located around the corner. 
I can definately recommend staying there![QWERTY123]Nice appartment close to two different metro stops, so easy acces to Manhattan. But Williamsburg is a nice neighbourhood as well, with some very nice restaurants and shops. Irina was very helpfull when we arrived. The appartment has a nice bathroom and a very comfortable bed![QWERTY123]Excellent apartment! Ground level... Which makes life easy. Safe. Close to 3 subways. The place had lots of nice products and lotions and a hair dryer. Irina showed us everything, gave us keys and then let us enjoy our stay. Very clean. 3 of us stayed. Good times![QWERTY123]Great apartment in a great area. Easy to check in/check out, I definitely recommend.[QWERTY123]Pros: Pretty nice, clean and spacious apartment in a good area. 3 different subways, all within 5 minutes walk. IMO, this part of Williamsburg is actually better than around the Bedford ave stop, which sometimes feels like a hipster circus. This area is more relaxed but still with lots of good restaurants and bars. And perfectly safe. Well-equipped kitchen. Allen and Irina let us store our bags in their shed after checkout, which was very convenient since we had a couple of hours to kill before our flight. 

Cons: The apartment is pretty dark. It's on ground level. You will hear street noises very clearly (this street is surprisingly quiet for NYC though). As far as we could make out, the TV reception was pretty bad, but we didn't come to New York to watch TV so we didn't really try to figure out if it could be made better. 

All in all, we had a positive experience. Good value for money.[QWERTY123]Everything as published. 
The location is good, you are a few metro stops away from Manhattan. The neighborhood is not so nice, but, for example, if you're gonna stay in upper west-side Manhattan, is exactly the same.
Forget about TV, the satellite service doesn't work.
Is a ground-level apartment, but is in a very quiet area. We sleep very well.
The best: the space (is huge!), the kitchen (away from the living-bedroom area), the location.
The worst: very dark, forget to be there without AC, TV service (but who needs TV in NYC!).
Is recommendable if you're gonna be in the street all day and just coming back to eat-sleep.[QWERTY123]Allen and Irina were great hosts, both of them met us when we arrived and gave us the house rules, Irina showed us how to work the TV and used her ""nose like a bloodhound"" to help fix the oven. They were really nice and cheery and instantly made us feel welcome. We needn't have brought any guidebooks as the basket on the table had plenty to choose from.

The apartment itself was really nice, it had a lovely homely feel and was surprisingly large, way more than enough room for 2. The bed was amazingly comfortable and the bathroom was great too. Another upside was that the apartment was always lovely and warm whenever we returned from our travels. Unfortunately we didn't get to try out the kitchen beyond using a glass or two (one of the downsides of eating out every night haha) but everything looked in working order.

The location of the apartment was brilliant. In a safe area that's just a walk away from Bedford Avenue and all manner of Restaurants, Cafés, Bars and Delis. There is definitely a lot to do near the apartment. It is also incredibly easy to travel into Manhattan via the L train only a few minutes walk away.

We would definitely recommend this apartment to anyone looking to visit New York. It is a great place to stay with amazing transport links and brilliant hosts.[QWERTY123]Place was great, good location and very homely. Allen & Irina were helpfully and welcoming.[QWERTY123]We had a wonderful stay. The apartment is very clean and had everything we needed. The host was friendly and easy to deal with. Check in was easy and it worked for us to leave our bags there past check out time as we had a later flight. This gave us time for one more quick trip into Manhattan and some shopping at a Christmas market. WiFi worked very well and was important for us to have. The soundproofing in the building is very minimal, but luckily the street out front was very quiet all weekend. We had no problem sleeping, even sleeping in quite late.

 Would defiantly stay here again and hope to next Thanksgiving weekend![QWERTY123]Das Apartment ist sehr gemütlich, sauber und gut angebunden. In unmittelbarer Nähe befinden sich diverse Delis, Diner und Restaurants. Man kann bequem zur Subwaystation laufen und ist sehr schnell in Manhattan. Irena und Allen sind sehr nett, hilfsbereit und locker.[QWERTY123]Clean, tidy, warm and easy to get to. A very good option if you want to be in Brooklyn and near a subway for quick access to Manhattan. It would be a bit dark if you wanted to spend any time indoors during the day, but near perfect as a place to sleep and shower at.[QWERTY123]Allen and Irina's place was a nice little getaway from Manhattan, and, as other reviews have said, it's a quick train ride into the city. The place was a great size and set up for two people and included a great internet connection (a minimum requirement for me) with access to Netflix and basic TV for the times not exploring the area. 
The windows were right on the street, which could get a bit noisy especially on the warmer evenings when people were out socializing in the neighborhood, but if you've worn yourself out sightseeing, you can easily block this out. Communication was great, the place was clean and stores to stock up on food were close by. An enjoyable stay.[QWERTY123]We very much enjoyed our stay at Allen and Irina's convenient Williamsburg home. The bottom story studio was welcoming and very warm (handy as it was bitter cold outside!) Irina was friendly and provided us with some local knowledge.[QWERTY123]Thanks to Allen and Irina :) It was a pleasure to stay in their warm, cosy place! Easy to get to Manhattan (just few stops). Besides, Davidson family was very helpful!
[QWERTY123]L'appartement correspondait exactement à la description. Tout était parfait. 
Nous avons passé un super séjour. 
Merci à Irina et Allen. 

[QWERTY123]Wir wurden von Irina sehr freundlich empfangen und haben uns in ihrem Studio sofort wohl gefühlt. Es ist alles sehr sauber und Bett und Schlafcouch waren sehr gemütlich. Für 3 Leute ist das Studio auf jeden Fall groß genug. Uns hat Williamsburg super gut gefallen und man erreicht Manhatten schnell und problemlos mit der Metro. Irina konnte uns gute Tips geben und war super hilfsbereit. Das Gebäude ist etwas hellhörig.[QWERTY123]Irina & Allen were amazing hosts - very attentive and easy going.  The apartment was as listed and very convenient for all of our needs.[QWERTY123]We loved our stay here. The room was clean, more spacious than the photos indicated, very warm and the bed was amazingly comfortable. We had all the creature comforts of home with a well stocked kitchen and extra blankets and towels stowed conveniently in the cupboard. The location is also great with it being close to many of the train stations and positioned in what felt like the outskirts of Williamsburg. It's not right in the thick of Williamsburg, but we liked that as it meant we were more likely to explore some of the other cool areas nearby, like Green Point and Brooklyn Heights. But in terms of walking distance, it is most closely located to the main part of Williamsburg than anywhere else and was a very easy walk to the main streets. 

In terms of the hosts, Allen and Irina, we found them to be hands-off but ready and there to help us when we needed them - so this suited us perfectly as we liked having our autonomy during our stay. Irina welcomed us when we first arrived and was very flexible with accommodating our arrival time that had shifted slightly. She also helped with printing some tickets for us while we were there and let us store our luggage in an adjoining shed after check-out - which was super appreciated as we weren't flying out until the evening! The only small point of feedback we have is that on one occasion we could not get the key to work in the door so we had to ring the bell to get back into the room. Allen came down to let us in but wasn't very friendly with us. It was after 10am in the morning and we hadn't lost the key, we just couldn't get it to work in the door, so we felt a bit put off by the manner we were met with. 

With everything said, this place is clean, cozy, homely and well located for those wanting to explore the many areas of Brooklyn. We would definitely recommend for others to stay here.[QWERTY123]Allen & Irina's place is in a great location in Williamsburg and was perfect for a weekend trip split between Manhattan and Brooklyn. The bed was king size and comfortable, and the kitchen was well-furnished. The apartment was nice and warm for a chilly weekend in New York and the street is relatively quiet street. The hosts left us with everything that we needed and let us make it our home for the weekend.[QWERTY123]Alan and Irina were kind and hospitable hosts, and the space was truly excellent. A little warm, cozy haven in the middle of Williamsburg with a nice big bed and large bathroom and kitchen. I will come back again![QWERTY123]We did a great stay!
She was very kind.
The room was very clean.
The kitchen is new and wide.
We also enjoyed cooking.
The room is 5-10 minutes walk from the station.
Thank you very much!!!![QWERTY123]Allen & Irina's apartment is exactly as pictured. Very nice and clean. The bed was extremely large and comfortable. Check-in and check-out were a breeze. 

As for the neighborhood, everything you need is close by. If you want to stay in Williamsburg, this is the place![QWERTY123]Everything was really clean and the appartment looks exactly like on the fotos. 5 min walk to the subway and Williamsburg is such a great area to go out, have drinks, dinner or do some shopping.

Allen and Irina were very friendly and everything was fine.[QWERTY123]Allen and Irina's apartment was an ideal location for my family. It was clean and had all the basic amenities that we needed. Irina was responsive regarding questions and check in and check out were super easy. Great stay![QWERTY123]Allen and Irina's apartment was great. The apartment was very spacious and the bed very big and comfortable.  The location in Williamsburg is very central,  near both the M and L trains. Very close to Manhattan but also great places in Williamsburg. We were walking distance to a great breakfast place named Otha's and many other little bodegas. We were also very close to Bedford avenue, where we went to some great restaurants and stores. I'd love to stay here next time we visit ![QWERTY123]I stayed at Allen and Irina's while visiting my son in Brooklyn. The location was close to him and very convenient for seeing Brooklyn and getting into NYC. The apartment was very clean and the bed quite comfortable. Although I spent very little time in the apartment, it was ideal for me-a nice clean place to stay. I would definitely stay here again.[QWERTY123]Irina and Allen where good hosts. The apartment is really comfortable, better than in photographs, silent and well equipped. There are two subway stations, markets and restaurants very near. Our two weeks stay in New York was great.
[QWERTY123]On the edge of Williamsburg this apartment was spotless, and ideal for our two nights in Brooklyn. It's an easy 20min walk into the main area of Williamsburg. Certainly made for a quieter stay after a week in Manhattan. The king size bed was a real treat, so beautifully made as well. There is a great bike shop in the next street - $25 for 4 hours, a great way to see your surrounds. Allen and irina were prompt with communication and accommodated our luggage after check out.[QWERTY123]Great location , very clean unit and amazing communication between the owner and us. Would stay again.[QWERTY123]Great location. Clean and lovely. Safe neighborhood.[QWERTY123]Nice stay in Brooklyn![QWERTY123]Nice place in Brooklyn. Hosts extremely available and helpful with everything.[QWERTY123]Irina and Allen were wonderful. The space is great and the location was close to the L. The space is slightly darker than in the photos, but we did not care about that. It was secure and fortunately had a powerful AC that would cool up the entire space quickly. Would definitely recommend for anyone looking to stay in Williamsburg.[QWERTY123]I had a great experience, Irina was there to greet me and welcome me to the Airbnb, and was very helpful in showing me all the amenities of the place. She was very easy to communicate with and very kind. I would definitely recommend staying there.[QWERTY123]This place has everything you need. The room was spacious and the bed was large and confortable. In the kitchen you can see the variety of tools and plates. Every morning we had great breakfast here. Irine was helful while we were staying. She also kindly lent us an umbrella when it rained. I liked the place.[QWERTY123]This was everything we needed! It was right around the corner from where our friend lives, and was beautifully large, clean, and so super comfortable. We were so happy to rest our heads here after a long day of walking all over NYC. Thank you guys so much for your hospitality. We will definitely be back again next year![QWERTY123]Irina was responsive to all our communications. She met us upon arrival, showed us around the apartment, and offered to be available if we needed anything. The apartment is spacious, well equipped, spotlessly clean and very comfortable, especially the wonderful king bed. Surprisingly quiet too![QWERTY123]We loved our time at Allen & Irina's place! It was really clean, bright and in a fantastic location. We met Irina on arrival, and she was very welcoming and happy to host us. They were especially accommodating to us, considering our flight was delayed several hours and arrived around midnight. The bed in this place is magnificent - very soft, and warm! The full kitchen is really nice, and is was great to see the dishwasher and clothes washer, even though we didn't use them. We recommend this place to anyone who needs a place to stay in Williamsburg. We will certainly look to Allen & Irina the next time we plan a trip to the area.[QWERTY123]Stayed here for five days with my girlfriend. We arrived late at night from the airport as our luggage was lost, but the kind host patiently waited for us! Pros: The apartment is centrally located in Williamsburg and is big and comfortable for two people. Cons: very noisy.[QWERTY123]Allen and Irina's place was clean and comfortable. The apartment was secure behind the cutest orange door on the block!  Neighborhood felt safe and was within walking distance to restaurants, grocery, and pharmacy. We definitely enjoyed our stay here, felt like a home away from home![QWERTY123]Das Studio hat eine tolle Lage und ist für New Yorker Verhältnisse wirklich sehr großzügig. Die große Küche ist sehr modern und vollständig ausgerüstet, wir haben sie allerdings gar nicht genutzt. Auch das Bad ist sehr geräumig. 
Was aus dem Inserat und den Bildern nicht hervorgeht, ist dass es sich quasi um ein Souterrain-Apartment handelt, daher also trotz voller Beleuchtung deutlich dunkler ist. Dadurch wirkt auch die größtenteils ""klassische"" Ausstattung weniger modern als auf den Bildern, was uns zu Beginn etwas enttäuscht hat. Aber wenn man wie wir sowieso nur zum Schlafen im Studio ist, ist das auch schnell wieder egal. Das riesige Bett ist dafür nämlich unglaublich bequem. Trotzdem in jedem Fall Ohrstöpsel mitnehmen, da es recht hellhörig ist.
Alles in allem hatten wir einen tollen Aufenthalt im Apartment.[QWERTY123]Irina was very friendly and cordial and provided a tour of the apartment on arrival.  I arrived many hours before check in and she allowed me to drop off my bags at the apartment which made it easier for me to go out into the city.  She offered a great suggestion for a nearby cafe for me to visit as well.  The apartment was very clean and cozy.  The neighborhood felt safe, and I saw lots of young adults as well as families walking around the area.  There was a little construction happening on the street at the time of my stay, but obviously out of the hosts control.  I would absolutely stay here again and look forward to returning.[QWERTY123]We loved staying here. Irina was really welcoming and helpful (we were particularly grateful that she let us leave our bags in the apartment after checkout on the final day, as our flight home was late afternoon).  The apartment was very comfortable - clean, spacious and homely. It was great to have Netflix for when we returned after a long day of sightseeing! The apartment was ideally situated for us - close to the subway and with lots of great places to eat and drink within walking distance. We would definitely stay there again. Thank you very much![QWERTY123]Irina war immer sehr gut zu erreichen – die Anreise/Abreise und „Check In/Out“ haben reibungslos funktioniert.
Das Appartement war sehr sauber und geräumig. In der Küche war alles vorhanden, um gut zu frühstücken.
Die Anbindung an Manhattan ist wirklich sehr gut – es sind nur ein paar Minuten bis zur nächsten Metro (Hewes St), die direkt über die Williamsburg Bridge nach Manhattan führt. Williamsburg selbst kann man gut zu Fuß erkunden.[QWERTY123]This is a great base for enjoying both Manhattan and Brooklyn. It's easy to get in to Manhattan on a couple of metro lines and it's nice to return at the end of the day to a comfy apartment in a neighbourhood rather than a tiny hotel room in Manhattan. The bed was extremely comfortable and we had great sleep each night despite a bit of noise from outside and above. The apartment was nice and clean and well equipped and the shower was good. Overall a very good choice.[QWERTY123]My stay was nice, the apartment had all of the amenities necessary for a stay -- and the bed was really comfortable. My only slight complaint is that the photos make the place look a lot brighter than it actually is -- it's a basement property so it was often quite dark, even with the lights on. Besides that, Irina was lovely and the apartment is in a great location for exploring Brooklyn and quickly getting into Manhattan. I would highly recommend staying here.[QWERTY123]Great place to stay in brooklyn. The appartement is very close from subway, it s spacious and bed is amazing ..Irina answers to your questions if you need it. Only one thing it s a little bit dark and noisy sometimes..[QWERTY123]Great location, great small apartment with large well equipped kitchen.  Noise levels a little high; could hear their parrot and outside as on ground level and poorly lit, but it was perfect for trip, comfortable and very clean.[QWERTY123]Fantastic apartment with loads of space and convenience. The bed is heaven. Occasionally noisy and the wifi can be patchy but it's the perfect location to explore the city from, or to take a stroll in Williamsburg.[QWERTY123]We really enjoyed our stay at Allen and Irina's apartment. Brooklyn is a wonderful area to explore on it own with lots of restaurants within walking distance. Very close to Metropolitan avenue station G and L lines as well as the J and M lines at Hewes St station (the latter particularly useful for connecting with the JFK airtrain) and the Q54 bus so the apartment is very easy to get to without having to use a taxi. There is everything in the apartment that you could possibly need including a dishwasher and all the kitchen accoutrements and the bed is super comfy. We loved our stay and found Irina and Allen to be great hosts. 

Oh and for any fellow Australian visitors who love their espresso, excellent Australian style coffee can be found within walking distance (1km) at Sweatshop cafe in metropolitan avenue.[QWERTY123]The apartment was very comfortable and it felt like our own home for 10 days! It is very well equipped with everything you need in the kitchen and plenty of linens and towels with extra pillows and blankets. The location is ideal for browsing Brooklyn or going to Manhattan. The subway is a short walk for the L train to Manhattan. The area has grocery stores, laundry, coffee shops, restaraunts, bars all within walking distance. Walk to Greenpoint and Williamsburg central or get the train to Fort Greene for further taste of Brooklyn - have a drink, a bite to eat, get your nails done, visit a book shop, work out in the park or sit and watch the world go by! The apartment has a real Brooklyn feel - the parrot upstairs chirping and the occasional street noise just added to the authentic  experience. We would love to return so One![QWERTY123]Everything was great. Close to manhattan and a lot of cool places in Brooklyn but still quiet[QWERTY123]Das Appartment und seine Lage eignet sich wirklich um NY zu erkunden. Die Küche ist sehr gut ausgestattet bietet sehr viel Platz. Das große Bett ist für 2 Personen gut ausreichend und sehr bequem. Das ausziehbare Sofa bietet ebenfalls Platz für 2 weitere Personen, hat aber seine besten Tage hinter sich und die Matratze ist etwas durchgelegen und unbequem. Ansonste alles top.[QWERTY123]The place is very close to the L train. Very good location.  Our flight came in late but Irina waited for us late to welcome us to the room.  Thank You ![QWERTY123]Allen and Irina's studio was a great place to stay in Williamsburg. Walking was no problem to different subway lines as well as being clean and tidy, we couldn't ask for a better place to enjoy our stay in Brooklyn! Thank you :)[QWERTY123]Irina was an excellent host. She communicated well at all times.
The apartment had everything that I needed and a very comfortable king-sized bed.
I felt safe walking around the neighborhood. 
The apartment was close to the subway and to some wonderful coffee houses like Mountain Province.
[QWERTY123]Allen and Irina are very responsive and we had a lovely time in their apartment. It's a great place to stay and super easy to get into Manhattan on the subway. The kitchen is fabulous if you want to cook as it has everything you could need![QWERTY123]Irina was very flexible with our arrival, since we had a few delays coming from the airport. She greeted us warmly and showed us around. Our stay was so short, so we weren't able to make use of the kitchen, which was quite big relative to the apartment. Ground floor made for easy in and out, plus the AC was a savior on warm evenings. Thanks a ton![QWERTY123]Spacious and very well equipped[QWERTY123]Très bel emplacement. Williamsburg est un quartier très sympathique qui vaut largement le détour. Appartement à 5 min du métro qui vous emmène très rapidement à Manhattan.
Appart très clean et très bien équipé.
C'était parfait ![QWERTY123]The apartment could really use updating and some new bath towels. The lighting isn't good especially in the bathroom (good luck putting on make up). The curtain shears do nothing to keep out the morning sun, so you can forget sleeping in. There is a new building going in directly behind the apartment so the noise is just starting. There isn't regular TV, just something like Hulu and Netflix. 

The host wasn't very helpful. We ran out of toilet paper 7 days into a 10 day stay and felt like we put the host out when we requested additional rolls. 

I won't recommend this location to anyone.[QWERTY123]Buona posizione ben servita dalla metropolitana
 ed ai supermercati 
Casa pulita
Host molto disponibile e simpatico 
Ubicato al piano terra con poca luce[QWERTY123]It has a grat location. Metro just 5 minutes away and you are in 15 minutes in Manhatten.[QWERTY123]Clean, comfortable, and convenient. We were delayed a full day because of travel issues, Allen and Irina were helpful and accommodating.[QWERTY123]Great location! The apartment does not get much natural light but it was clean and comfortable. Irina was responsive and very accommodating.[QWERTY123]The accommodation of Allen & Irina is extremely close to the center of Williamsburg and close to public transport. It’s safe, clean and has everything needed to start living here. 

Thank you for being such a great host!![QWERTY123]Sweet, cozy space. Clean, quiet, near subway. We slept really well after roaming around all day. We didn't see much of our hosts, but they seemed friendly and accommodating when we needed to drop our bag off before check-in time. And responsive via email when we couldn't figure out how to use the TV.[QWERTY123]The apartment is clean, and stylish and made a lovely home for the week we stayed there. The location is also great - 5 minute walk from the subway through what felt like a very safe area and with a great diner on the walk home![QWERTY123]We chose this place based on photos, location, and price and were happy with the location but were surprised by the difference between the photos and what the place actually looks like. It has everything shown in the photos, but is not as nice as it looks. The furniture smells musty and and old and worn so it takes a minute to take it in. The kitchen is fully equipped and has a washer machine.  

The price was right until we paid and realized the cleaning fee is as much as an extra night stay (we are from the area and use a reputable cleaning service that is less than half that price). 

The main issue was unfortunately the hosts. When we arrived there was a long silence and we had to start asking questions to try to figure out the basics- where are the keys? What is the wifi? etc. We were told the locks were funny but weren't shown how to work them until we couldn't lock the door and were locked out. A positive note: they do have netflix they allowed us to use!

The noise was pretty bad- the hosts live in the apartment upstairs and seem to own a bird that was periodically making noise. Footsteps and bangs were constant. On our last night stay we were awoken by loud banging that sounded like someone throwing something down the stairs that started at 6am and lasted about a half an hour.[QWERTY123]Die Wohnung ist nah an den Stationen Hewes Street, Broadway und Metropolitan Avenue. Vom Flughafen erreicht man die Wohnung auch sehr gut mit der Bahn (AirTrain nach Jamaica und dann die Bahn zur Hewes Street). Die Grand Street und die Bedford Avenue, hier sind viele Bars, Restaurants und Einkaufsmöglichkeiten in Williamsburg, sind fußläufig erreichbar.  

Die Wohnung ist sehr sauber gewesen und war gut ausgestattet. Allen und Irina wohnen im Obergeschoss. 

Check In und Check Out verliefen problemlos. Wie konnten auch nach dem Check Out unsere Koffer da lassen, da wir erst später geflogen sind. 

Wir würden ein weiteres mal die Wohnung von Allen und Irina buchen![QWERTY123]We enjoyed Allen & Irina's place -- it was spacious, clean, and well-located.  The bed was king size and very comfortable. Kitchen had everything we needed. Host provided every convenience including towels, soap, shampoo etc 

People sensitive to noise will hear emergency vehicle sirens and street noise from time to time as the windows are not very thick - but that's Brooklyn![QWERTY123]We had a really nice time in Irina & Allens apartment during our 10-day-stay in Williamsburg. They were very kind and flexible about the check-in and check-out. The apartment is everything you need for a city trip with a lot of restaurants, bars and several metro stations close by. Thanks again. We would definitely stay again![QWERTY123]We had a great stay at Irina's place. The place is really comfortable and cozy, close to the subway and in a very nice neighbourhood (really good restaurant and coffees!). The place is very spacious for 2 people. The only downside : I wouldn't recommend it for light sleepers, the noise insulation between the apartment and the one above isn't really good, so we were sometimes woken up by the noise from upstairs. We used earplugs and it was ok. So altogether we had a really good stay so we would recommend this place![QWERTY123]Très bon emplacement, à proximité de plusieurs métro et dans un quartier agréable. L'appartement et spacieux et très propre, avec tous les équipements nécessaires. Les hôtes étaient très réactifs. L'insonorisation n'est pas idéale donc pensez à prendre des boulquies si vous êtes sensibles au bruit ![QWERTY123]Comfortable basement apartment. Convenient location - close to hewes st station. 
Good base for New York trip.[QWERTY123]Irina was a fantastic host and the apartment is great for anyone looking to visit NYC. Williamsburg is a good area and this has quick access to two different subway lines. Plus it has A/C, a comfortable bed and was super close. Would highly recommend.[QWERTY123]Very nice![QWERTY123]Do not miss this place. Incredible value, nice and clean and less than 15 minutes to Manhattan[QWERTY123]Great location. Easy communications. Would stay here again.[QWERTY123]Irina welcomed us personally at her apartment. The apartment itself was   Cozy and well equipped (it was luxury to have a washing machine and a dish washer).
The huge bed was fantastic as well and much larger than expected.

We where as well welcomed by a basket with traveling guides and even a multiple-function-adapter. 

We greatly enjoyed our stay and definitely recommend vacations here to visit New York City. Williamsburg is quite enough at night for some good hours of sleep and near enough to Manhattan to get to  the many sightseeing’s and places quickly. Williamsburg itself has some really nice restaurants and bars which are worth visiting as well[QWERTY123]We spent 4 days in Brooklyn at Allen and Irina's place.  Location is perfect for exploring NYC.  Obviously Brooklyn is at your doorstep, but also a quick subway ride to Manhatten.   Lot's of fun restaurants, bars and bodegas right outside your door, lots within a quick 5 minute walk.  There is definitely some street noise, but that comes from being in the city.  It didn't bother us and we are usually sensitive to noise.  Nice having a king sized bed and it was also really comfortable!  We would definitely recommend staying here, particularly if you are looking to stay in Williamsburg.[QWERTY123]The only orange door around the neighborhood. Irina came to meet us when we arrive and showed us around the apartment. The house was tidy and fully furnished which also gave us a chance to cook.. She has been very helpful in answering our queries. Would love to have the place again in case we’ll be around the neighborhood. It is also few minutes walk to the subway.[QWERTY123]Great host. I highly recommend staying at Allen & Irina`s place.[QWERTY123]Irina and Allen provide prompt communication and have a very clean place in a great location. Very welcoming, nice hosts."	40.70837198668388	-73.95351868854335	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/6848	3	140.0	0.84
37	18728	"Rick was a most pleasant and accommodating host.  He really made us feel welcomed and at home in this spacious two floor apartment. You can tell right off the bat that great attention to detail and care was taken to make our stay very comfortable.  Unfortunately, we did not  get the opportunity to meet Dave since he was on tour.  

The apartment itself offers ample space and sufficient privacy, so you really feel at home and relaxed at all times. The space was just like in the pictures - spacious, clean, and modern with an unbeatable location.

Overall, the experience of staying at Rick & Dave’s was better than expected. I highly recommend staying there for anyone who’s looking for a taste of one of New York’s most vibrant neighborhoods, all the while staying in comfortable accommodations.    

Thanks Rick!
[QWERTY123]TOP!
David is a very nice and helpful host
The place is absolutley great. 
It is a two floor apartment. Guestroom is (Website hidden by Airbnb) you have your privacy....also your private bathroom.
For me: One of the places to stay in New York[QWERTY123]David & Rick were welcoming, helpful, professional and accommodating. The location was ideal in many respects - convenient to venues, public transportation, stores and eateries. The loft itself surpasses how great it looks in the photos. It was inviting, clean, secure and had 1st class amenities. It was a pleasure meeting David & Rick and staying at their incredible loft.[QWERTY123]It was a real pleasure to stay at Dave & Rick apartment. 
It's very well located and proper - it have a full privacy and have a large space. We have really felt they had the huge sense of hospitality.
The district itselfs is very nice. 

I strongly recommend not only the apartment itselfs but speding few days and time with Dave & Rick who are really nice guys.[QWERTY123]I was coming to NYC for a few days for a conference and decided to add a few extra days to the stay. Typically, I stay in a place where I have the entire place to myself. However, the combination of location (just off the Meatpacking district) and the apartment itself which is pretty spectacular won me over quickly. Beautiful place in a great location hosted by some very friendly people. A really great place to stay. I had an entire floor to myself that itself was twice the size of most manhattan apts and three times the size of most studios/1 bdrooms.[QWERTY123]I can't imagine how much more wonderful hosts could be than David & Rick.  Thoughtful, accommodating welcoming, helpful, and just plain really cool & nice!  Their beautiful home is comfy and warm.  I feel like I have new friends in The CIty.   Thanks Guys!  MmmmWA![QWERTY123]It's a beautiful place in a great location adjacent to the West Village, close to Chelsea and to one of my favorite places in Manhattan - the Rubin Museum. 

Guests stay downstairs in what is effectively a separate apartment. A stairway leads down to a mysterious hallway (think Jean Cocteau) at the end of which one can glimpse the shimmer of light on the GORGEOUS Petrov grand piano. The decor is a mix of contemporary with middle eastern/islamic furniture found in the bazaars and souks of Cairo. A skylight provides soft illumination during the day and this must be one of the quietist spaces in all of Gotham. You will soon find yourself happily ensconced and secure as an emir in this lavish redoubt![QWERTY123]David & Rick's apartment is stunning and in a really great location. They were excellent hosts and by the end of the stay felt much more like friends. They showed me around, invited me to parties and got me on the guest list to a few special events. I can also imagine that they would be equally comfortable to leave other guests to themselves if they were not feeling as sociable as i was.
If you have any doubts about the room layout, as it is a bit hard to understand from the description and photos; you get a whole floor to yourself, with a bathroom. This is great and pretty private. The sofa bed is not as comfortable as a real bed, but I found it more than enough and fine for anyone but the most fussy guest. If there are more than 2 of you, the couch can be made up to be a good sleeping additional place.[QWERTY123]David and Rick were great hosts. Very friendly and welcoming and were happy to give tips on where to go in the city. The room is also very nice and comfortable and the location is very convenient. Highly recommended if visiting NY.[QWERTY123]David,+ Rick were wonderful hosts. easygoing, flexible, and very helpful w/ suggestions when needed. would stay again w/o question. the location of their accommodation was a plus as well. this was my first use of airbnb,+ the experience will have me booking through them again...[QWERTY123]David & Rick's Place was just amazing - as David & Rick are themself. Very centraly located, the appartment is def.more than just a ""room"". You have a whole floor just for yourself, everything is clean and looks more than nice.

David & Rick are the best hosts you can imagine. As David was at home most of the time we where there (but upstairs, never ever bothering you!), he helped us with every question, gave us tips and told us where to go to.

If you're looking for a cool, centraly located, clean & even stylish place with more than just friendly hosts - contact them.

Raffael & Lukas[QWERTY123]David and Rick are both friendly gracious hosts.  Their home is comfortable, spacious and beautifully furnished; its also spotlessly clean.  Its in a great location close to the the subway (ACE & L) and restaurants and a short walk to Union Square.  The guest quarters are secluded downstairs with a large sitting area, a sleeping are and a bathroom.  I travel to NYC frequently for work, and this is a far better value than you will ever find for any comparable hotel.[QWERTY123]My buddy and I had a wonderful time staying with Rick & David. Unfortunatelly David was out of town the whole time, but Rick was more than a great host. He was very attentive and helped us out with a lot of tips where to go and how to get there. He even walked us to some places nearby so we don't get lost :-) We had very interesting and delightful conversations together and a very enjoyable dinner at a Thai-Restaurant in the Meatpacking-District.

The apartement is also really nice and very large. We had the whole downstairs-part for ourselves. The bed and the couch where comfatable and the bathroom was very good and clean too. The rooms are lovely decorated and everything is very clean. We were also allowed to use the kitchen upstairs for cooking - in the end we didn't use it though. The only thing that is missing downstairs is a window for daylight and a little fresh air. But Air-Condition is available. We always felt very much like beeing at home when coming back to the apartement.

In addition the area (Meatpacking District) is the place to be right now in New York. It's very hip and trendy and there are a lot of nice restaurants, bars and shops. The new amazing High-Lines starts just one block away. The complex has a doorman, which makes you feel good. And the area seems to be very save too.

We definitly can recommend the apartement for a visit in NY. We have no complains whatsoever - only good experiences. Thanks for a great time to Rick & David!![QWERTY123]We have to pass a super stay
Very pleasant apartment has to live with all the comfort which it owes
a place typically very new yorkais and very knack with a charming host has your service I recommend it highly[QWERTY123]My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay in Rick and David's home. The location is perfect and convenient to many trains or trains with connections to other trains. The neighborhood is filled with restaurants, nice bars, and retail shops. Buddakan is just a couple blocks away for you Sex and the City fans; this is where Carrie and Big have their rehearsal dinner.

The building is secure with a 24-hour doorman. The basement level is ultra swanky and comfortable. There are no windows because it's the basement which I felt made it cozy, but it does make it easy to sleep in because you aren't able to sense the sun rising. Our hosts provided everything we could possibly need and even offered recommendations for places in the area. Rick is quite affable and made us feel extremely welcome. As my first experience using AirBNB, I can only hope all future experiences are just the same.[QWERTY123]I had a fabulous stay in NYC. This place is very spacious. It was fabulous to have a private living area! The location is fantastic! Lots of cool things to do and see! Very close to Subway  - which is very handy! Highly recommended![QWERTY123]We stayed with Rick (David was away) for 6 days in December 2011 and it has been a great experience. The apartment location is perfect, the place is big, with a complete privacy thanks to a separate floor. But more importantly Rick was a wonderful host, communication was  seamless, he was helpful and friendly yet not intrusive, we just regret we did not have the chance to spend more time together actually! The only downside? The floor for guests is underground, without window, which can feel somehow a little oppressive at times if you are claustrophobic. But frankly all in all it was a great stay and I would recommend them to anyone[QWERTY123]This was my second stay at David and Rick's place.  Everything in my original review is still true on the second visit.  Its a great space in a great location with great hosts; I couldn't have asked for anything more.[QWERTY123]Rick was an outstanding host. Friendly, informative and did his best to make sure I felt at home. 
The apartment itself is impeccably decorated, which makes you feel at home as soon as you step through the front door. I highly recommend staying at this apartment.[QWERTY123]My friend and I had a fantastic time staying at Rick and Daves.  Rick was a superb host (Dave was away), helping us out in anyway we needed, and giving some great advice when we were unsure of where to go.  The location is amazing - close to a subway station with great lines, which makes it so easy to get round New York - we didn't catch a cab once!  The Meat Packing district is brilliant, so easy to walk to great restaurants and clubs from the apartment at night, and to wonderful shops in the mornings.  The apartment is beautiful, and you have plenty of your own space - we enjoyed spending a night in just relaxing in front of tv.  We would highly highly recommend staying with Rick and Dave.  As first time AirBnB users, it was absolutely fantastic - thanks so much guys![QWERTY123]My staying have been great! 
Location & Location & Location: in the heart of Meatpacking's area and just 2 blocks from the blu metro line. So convenient!
Super clean and the rooms' space is huge.
Rick was a great host.
I will definitely come back![QWERTY123]Rick & David are exceptional hosts, very helpful, friendly and attentive to all my needs. Their place is charming, spotless clean and it can easily makes you feel like at home. As a guest I stayed downstairs and it felt like staying in a separate apartment. Very comfortable and cozy!
The location is great - the nearest subway station is just around the corner - and it's also easy to walk around. The neighborought is very lively, safe and filled with good restaurants, bars and nice shops. 
It was my first time in NY and also my fist time with Airbnb and I could not have hoped for anything better! 
Rick & David's place is highly recommended![QWERTY123]My stay with David and Rick couldn't have been easier, this was the first time i used airbnb and hoped it would be as good as it sounded and it was , my hosts opened their home to me and were very helpful on any matter regarding info on places to go and see in Manhattan. The apartment is clean and quiet, and the location perfect , near the underground meant no worries about crisscrossing the city. a 5 star experience.. thank you David and Rick[QWERTY123]David and Rick are great guys with a world of knowledge, experiences and a great sense of comedy.

If your after a great time in New York you will simply love their amazing flat. The 'tomb' is the most incredible refurbished space, but the real value is the hosts themselves. If you are fortunate enough to spend time with the guys, you'll learn to know why.

Amazing flat, great location and hosts with local knowledge... priceless.[QWERTY123]I stayed with Dave and Rick for over a week and because of that I truly had my best New York experience, starting with Dave & Rick, those guys really make you feel welcome with literally an opened door policy and with  Dave normally at home you always have a reference guide a couple of steps away. they offer you a whole floor to yourself with complete privacy even for the very paranoid. The place is very comfortable and romantic with a Moroccan theme and if you are lucky enough you get a chance to see Dave performs a song as a bonus.
the area is where everyone wants to be and if you are a foodie like me brace yourself to experience the best cuisine that the Meatpacking District has to offer, and if you are a fan of the nightlife get ready to party but one thing for sure dress to impress because the area's best clubs will eat you alive without the proper attire. as far as the shops you're a few blocks away from the best shopping’s in NY and short cab ride from Central Park in a nutshell for my next trip in NYC they better have my dates available because after staying with those guys I wouldn't want to be anywhere else. Go out there have a blast!
[QWERTY123]I adored staying at David and Rick's home. Not only is it in an excellent location (the neighbourhood is very safe and close to everything), but it's extremely clean and comfy. I didn't want for anything. I stayed in their home for a month and at all times I felt completely welcome and free to do as I pleased. I'm now trying to figure out how I can spend another month there next year :).[QWERTY123]Outstanding hosts. Excellent location. 5 stars.[QWERTY123]Dave and Rick are wonderful hosts and make you feel right at home! I stayed here with my girlfriend for 3 nights. The place is amazing: right in the middle of where you want to be for a fun time in New York.
Thanks again.

[QWERTY123]My partner and i stayed at Rick and David's amazing apartment for 9 nights in Sept 2012.  Firstly - Rick and David were the most amazing hosts.  We were remotely arranging our wedding from Australia and we found them SO helpful in providing recommendations and ideas for our visit.  When we arrived Rick greeted us and we were delighted to discover we had so much space to ourselves!  Their apartment is second to none and we couldn't recommend staying with them highly enough!  The location was perfect - right in the middle of all the action, close to a train station and anything else you might need.  We can't wait to visit again![QWERTY123]Location is PERFECT!  14th street is near everywhere in Manhattan.  Apartment is very near subway.  The guest area is spacious.  The apartment is super clean.  Doorman.  Good security.  Rick was a very good host.  Very warm, friendly, attentive but gives you as much privacy as you want.  He took me out one Friday evening which turned out to be my best night in NYC yet.  My only wish was that David were not on tour and the next time I visit NYC, I will ensure that is the case.[QWERTY123]It was our first time in NYC and it was the best place we could imagine to stay. 
Rick was a most pleasant and accommodating host. He really made us feel welcomed and we felt very comfortable at this place. On top he gave us so many useful and great tipps for NYC that we were happy about! 

Thanks a lot therefore!! 

Unfortunately, we did not get the opportunity to meet David since he was on tour. 

The apartment itself offers huge space and sufficient privacy, so you really feel at home and relaxed at all times. The space was just like in the pictures - spacious, clean, and modern. 
The Location is unbeatable especially if one love good restaurants with great flair.  It is perfect and convenient to many trains.
I highly recommend staying there for anyone who’s looking for a taste of one of New York’s most vibrant neighborhoods, all the while staying in comfortable accommodations. 

If we go to NYC again, for sure, David and Rick will be the first ones we will ask a accomendation again.  

Thanks for taking us as guests. 

Esther and Tobi[QWERTY123]Best trip I have had in NYC and staying at Rick's place had a major part to play in this. Location was unreal and the apartment is super cool. Clean, stylish and big. The basement space is like a Moroccan Den!
I hope the space will be available on my return in Spring. 
Rick was a really nice guy and although we didn't get to hang out that much he opened his home to us and made us feel very welcome. 
10/10!!!!
[QWERTY123]We had a wonderful time visiting NYC and were thrilled with the accommodations and our gracious host, Rick.  (David was out of town).  Rick made us feel like his and David's lovely place was a home away from home for us in New York City. His knowledge of the city and hints for great restaurants and places to go were fantastic and made our time there even more enjoyable. He also communicated with David long distance to get more information for us on the local jazz scene which pointed us in the direction of some of the best music we heard while we were there! So if you are considering a stay in New York City you really just have to stay with Rick and David. You will be right in the heart of the city within walking distance of anything you could want and just a subway away from all that Manhattan has to offer!![QWERTY123]We arrived at david and rick appartment during the blackout caused by Sandy ! Rick made our arrival really easy and we felt quickly very comfortable in their nice appartment. Rick shared with us some good tips regarding museum and restaurant. The building itself was really nice and we felt very secured. One floor was dedicated to us which we really appreciated. Finally power was restored and we enjoyed even more staying at Rick and David place. Neighbourhoud was exactly what we were expecting few building and a lot of nice street in greenwich! We will be more than happy to come back to their appartment![QWERTY123]Rick and David were wonderful hosts although we never had the opportunity to meet them in person as we stayed during the Thanksgiving holiday weekend and they were away. Even though they were away they made arrangements with the doorman for our access to the apt. late in the evening. During our stay they were always very accessible and helpful with restaurant suggestions as well as art exhibitions. When we arrived we spoke with Rick over the phone and he provided a thorough overview of the apartment -what was where etc.  A couple of times I had questions and texted Rick and he responded very quickly. 

The apartment is as described and pictured and HUGE.  And you simply can't beat the location.  Located in the heart of the Meatpacking district there's plenty of shops, restaurants, etc. and it's only a short stroll from two subway stations. Try the brunch at Standard Grille a block away (another tip of Rick's) and the octopus is particularly recommended.

Although the apartment is centrally located and on the ground floor it was perfectly quiet during our entire stay.  

Throughout the experience Rick and David made us feel as if we were staying at the apartment of a friends. They simply couldn't have been more generous in spirit or more welcoming.  We definitely plan to stay there again and hopefully get to meet them.[QWERTY123]When the guest room is bigger than a hotel room, stay here! David and Rick are amazing hosts, always made us feel at home every time we came back from a long day sightseeing and always happy to sit around and chat. It is the most spacious, biggest space I've seen in NYC, not to mention the location is fantastic, surrounded by restaurants, bars, markets, you name it! The house is exceptionally clean, simply can't complain. Definitely will stay here again and recommend to friends.[QWERTY123]Staying here is the best decision I've made for my NYC trip! Seriously, look no further. Rick and Dave are fantastic hosts and their apartment ticks all boxes.. Super convenient location right in between the best neighborhoods to explore on foot ( Chelsea, Meatpacking, West Village n SOHO),with food always available around the corner and bus/subway lines within less than 5 mins walk. The Highline and Hudson promenade less about 5 mins away only. As a female travelling alone even at night I found the area incredibly safe. The apartment itself was spotless, beautiful and emanates a very pleasant vibe. The basement where the sleeping alcove is, is a magnificent expanse of space. I slept like a log. Wish I had more time to interact with Rick n Dave as they were really friendly and helpful but my itinerary was manic. Would stay here in a heartbeat if they'd host me again![QWERTY123]our stay was the hospitality and warmth of the room was beyond our expectations! certainly one of our most enjoyable and David and Rick were excellent! the apartment is very clean, modern and above all consistent with pictures! The hosts are very available information for the sights of New York. Their kindness and hospitality we were simply amazed!! thank you again[QWERTY123]Staying at Rick and David's place was such a pleasure, I can't recommend it enough.  Their place is big, beautiful and extremely well located.  To top that Rick is absolutely lovely and makes you feel so welcome in his home (sadly David was on tour).   Hope to see you again![QWERTY123]10/10!! 
Rick is the best host I have stayed with ... I entered his apartment as a paying-guest and left as a friend. The apartment is sweet ... and the massive room one gets in the basement is sweeter. 5 star accommodation through and through. One and a half baths ... a massive sofa, a comfy bed, a super sound system, a well stocked fridge and a host who is more than willing to go that extra mile to ensure 'service delivery'.
My experience in NYC was better because of Rick. Hopefully next time I will get to meet David as well. Go for this option and you are guaranteed a great time.[QWERTY123]Wow! What a pleasure to stay at this luxurious Moroccan inspired den... In the heart of trendy West downtown NYC! Absolutely enormous and beautiful space to enjoy, with all the comforts you could possibly ask for. From a nespresso machine, to TV... to a grand piano, which is quite some ornament :) Unbelievable amount of space and a quiet environment: could this really be central New York City?? Amazing location. David was on tour, but I am so glad I got to meet and spend time with Rick.  Aside from being an impeccable host (and having great interior design skills ;). ) he is just a wonderful person to know. Thank you for your your warmth, humor and conversation. Without question will stay here next time I'm visiting NYC[QWERTY123]I just spent  the most amazing month with some amazing (Website hidden by Airbnb) a very amazing place!!!  Thank you Rick and David for helping make that possible.  They made me feel so welcome in their amazing home.  I wasn't a guest, I was a roommate:)

The ""love den"" was beyond words.  Romantic, clean, spacious, and private.  I can't wait to come back.............[QWERTY123]I stayed for 12 days in the apartment, which has the perfect location in Manhattan. You can reach all of Manhattan’s areas within few minutes (the subway station – serving the Blue and L line – is very close to the apartment). However, as you already are in the Meatpacking district you can also just walk to the many bars and restaurants in the neighborhood. During my stay David and Rick were both staying in the apartment and they are truly great hosts; they make you feel very welcome in their home! The hospitality was way beyond expectation. David and Rick were always happy to have a chat with me. They also could give me all the tips and recommendations for stores and restaurants I was looking for. I definitely feel like I have stayed with friends in NYC. The apartment itself is huge and as a guest you will stay in the basement, whereas David and Rick have their bedroom upstairs. It was a truly amazing experience and therefore overall a clear 10 out of 10. I definitely plan to stay there again if I go back to NYC. Thanks again David & Rick.[QWERTY123]A.  The location

Dave and Rick's place is situated in what is probably one of the best locations you can choose in NYC, especially if, like us, you're a first time visitor trying to get your bearings. Step out of their apartment; walk one way and you're suddenly in the heart of the West Village and gorgeous Bleecker Street. Walk the other and you step in to trendy Chelsea with its glorious eateries; or take yet another direction and you find yourself on the Highline promenade along the Hudson River.
Additionally, on the opposite end of their block you'll find a Subway station connecting you to the blue A, C and E lines.
There is an abundance of wonderful restaurants and diners within a 5-minute walking radius, suiting every sort of budget, that Mike and I were very much spoilt for choice at most mealtimes. 
Really, the location in itself is a good enough reason to choose their place above others.

B.  The apartment itself
Many people have already described the place in other reviews, so suffice to say it's a 2-floor arrangement: you get to occupy the basement level, done up in a Moroccan theme; whilst your hosts occupy the ground-floor level. The luxuriously furnished guest area is extremely spacious and kept spotlessly clean; it is comfortable and equipped with more creature comforts than you'll probably need while on holiday. It's a wonderful space to kick back and relax during those times when you want to rest your tired feet after walking about the city. Crucially, the fact that it's equipped with WiFi also means that those, like Mike and I, having jobs that require you to frequently touch base with the office can get their email-writing and report-drafting done comfortably and without distractions.
Despite the guest area being designed as an open plan without any doors (apart from the bathrooms, naturally), privacy is not an issue and we never once felt 'encroached' in our space.

C.  The Hosts
Reviewers are wont to call their hosts wonderful when drawing up these sort of reviews, because it's by far the easiest thing to say. Truth is, however, that Rick and Dave are both genuinely lovely people who go that extra mile to make sure their guests are afforded the very best of their hospitality. It was truly a pleasure to stay with them and share their apartment.
Dave was frequently home during the days we were there and was extremely helpful with giving us tips for restaurants and other venues in the immediate vicinity, and even joined us in grabbing a quick pizza on one of the evenings we were there.[QWERTY123]Beautifully decorated apartment in the best location- in the heart of the Meatpacking district and minutes walk from exceptional dining, clubs and transport. I absolutely adored David and Rick as they are sweethearts and a pleasure to stay with. Highly recommend- I'll definitely be back! :)[QWERTY123]Excelllent location. Great hosts, really friendly yet not crowding! We had the entire lower level to ourselves and it is huge. Only 1 block from the subway that takes you uptown and right around the corner from the Chelsea Market with great eateries and the best coffee ever (Ninth Street Espresso)!

The best people watching around if you like to just sit and see tons of people dressed to impress. There are lots of clubs and restaurants right outside the door! 

The hosts were great and we never felt awkward using the washing machine or using the kitchen to make a cup of tea or store our left overs in their fringe. They really make you feel like you are at home. I asked for a fan since I get hot at night and Rick gave me one right away and they were both so helpful giving us tips on jazz clubs, how to get places and whatever we needed!

We would definetly come back here and highly recommend it to anyone wanting a great experience in a great location!
[QWERTY123]Mitten im angesagten Meatpacking District mit seinen vielen Restaurants, Bars und Clubs, der U-Bahn gleich um die Ecke und bei unglaublich netten Gastgebern zu wohnen - Reisender, was will du mehr? Die Wohnung bietet mehr Platz als jedes Hotelzimmer und ist total ruhig. Alles in allem: absolut empfehlenswert*****[QWERTY123]We couldn't have wished for a more perfect stay.  If you're planning a visit to New York and you are looking for a smart apartment, hospitable and generous hosts and perfect location, then look no further.  David & Rick really made us feel welcome and were always extremely helpful with advice for good restaurants and local attractions.  They are very charming hosts.  The apartment was so well located, right next to Subways and across from great tourist spots including the Highline, Chelsea Market, art galleries and restaurants.[QWERTY123]David and Ricks in our opinion is honestly the best place you could stay in New York. The area is just amazing with lots of cool bars, restaurants, cafes and shops with lovely walks around the streets and near the subway. David and Rick went out of their way to be friendly and give us advice on the area and made us feel at home. You can use the kitchen and washing facilities and the basement area which is huge is completely yours with a comfy bed, air con, sofas, piano and bathroom. Can't recommend this place highly enough, we will be sure to stay here again![QWERTY123]I spent more than two weeks in David and Rick’s house, occupying their comfortable basement with all its fine pieces of furniture and decoration – not to mention a beautiful real piano! Both floors in their loft show the care and taste they have been created with, and every object reflects a sense of beauty. Of course, as other guests before me have mentioned, the house is kept meticulously clean. I very much enjoyed the calm and relaxed atmosphere with David and Rick and the feeling of trust and respect that underlies the day-to-day life. I also had the privilege of benefitting from David’s presence during my stay there, and I absolutely cherished the almost daily long breakfast conversations we shared! Regarding the location, it is indeed great, with the subway and highline being literally around the corner and a few minutes stroll into the village. Thanks to both of you![QWERTY123]You could not choose to stay anywhere better in NYC! Both the apartment and the hosts are amazing. My fiancé and I stayed with David and Rick for just under a week and we wished it had been longer.  We have stayed in other AirBnB rentals in the area and they simply do not compare in terms of space, amenity and decor! The location was also perfect with easy access to the subway, nightlife and the Highline. We also absolutely loved the company as David and Rick are so friendly and welcoming, you feel like you are staying with family.  More than looking forward to our next stay in NYC, we are looking forward to staying with David and Rick. These guys know NYC like no one else and might even be able to tell you about (or take you to) clubs, bars and restaurants you would otherwise have missed out on. You will not find better than this (Website hidden by Airbnb)[QWERTY123]What amazing hosts David and Rick are to open their amazing pad to fellow travellers like me.

I could not have asked for a better experience in staying with them.   The most fabulous hospitality you could wish for in wonderful NYC.

Their home is beautiful, they are beautiful and very respectful, the ambience is awesome and the location; wow everything on your doorstep.

Thank you guys; I hope to be back someday soon and stay with you again!!!

[QWERTY123]My boyfriend and I spent 2 weeks in New York and stayed in David and Rick's apartment the entire time. We were incredibly happy with our choice! The location, right in the heart of the Meatpacking District, was perfect for us. We were a few minutes walk from some great places, such as Chelsea Markets, The High Line, and MANY great restaurants and bars. 

The apartment itself was clean, spacious, stylish and fun - And the designated guest area, is an entire floor with bathroom, TV, couch, coffee table, sofa bed and piano! There was more than enough room! They also had everything we needed - Soaps, shampoo, laundry detergent, toilet paper, milk, towels etc etc!

Despite the fact that David and Rick were away the entire time we stayed in their place (bar one day), they went out of their way to be amazing hosts! They gave us a list of all the places we should see, bars we should go to, even the best supermarkets. They made us feel welcome to ask any questions we had, and gave us great advice on what the city has to offer. They even called us from their own holiday multiple times to make sure we were having a great time!

All in all, a FANTASTIC experience thanks to David and Rick (and their beautiful apartment)! I definitely recommend to anyone going to New York!! Looking forward to seeing you in Sydney very soon Dave![QWERTY123]David was traveling so I got to meet only Rick. Rick was a very friendly and respectful host. The room, which is actually the basement of their two-story apartment, is very spacious. The bed is comfortable and I was able to sleep late when I needed. The apartment is in a nice, lively neighborhood. I would definitely stay again.
[QWERTY123]My daughter and I stayed with David, Rick was out of town, for a week. What a fabulous place, Rick stayed up until we got there at 11pm and was super welcoming. The place is spotless, devoid of clutter (not sure how they pull that one off). While the bed downstairs is a sleeper bed, it's extremely comfortable,I think there's some memory foam on top, didn't feel like a sofa bed. A bathroom downstairs and one upstairs, a fabulous coffee machine, beautiful decor, and charming host, in a fabulous neighbourhood with glorious restaurants and most importantly, bakeries. What a great experience:)
[QWERTY123]This was my very first trip to NYC and my stay with Rick (David was out of town) was fantastic! From the moment I got there Rick made me feel so welcomed. He is very thoughtful and really makes you feel like this is your place just as much as his. He helped with any questions I had and never made me feel like I was annoying him.  The apartment is immaculate!  Very modern but very warm at the same time. The BEAUTIFUL downstairs (where the guests stay)  was exquisite and better than any hotel.  From the artwork to the lighting to the furniture..what an atmosphere!  The sleeping area was perfect. The bed was very comfortable and was adorned with comfy blankets, linens, and pillows. There is a little closet provided to put your things in and also an A/C unit just in case it gets too warm.  The main living area was just as comfortable.  A nice couch to relax on and a TV with surround sound!  It was nice to just veg and watch the telly after a long day in the city. The main loft was just as exquisite .I had full access to the bathroom and the kitchen In fact, I made myself a cup of  Espresso each morning.:)  The location is perfect with just steps away to the High Line, Chelsea Market and lots of restaurants. There is easy access to the subways too.  The village I found was the best part of the city and I'm so thankful I found Rick & David's place. I will definitely be going back to the city and when I do,  I'll always see if their place is available first![QWERTY123]Absolutely LOVED our stay in this stunning, spacious and amazingly locatated meatpacking district apartment.

Rick was an incredible host - gave us great tips on where to eat the first night, was very accommodating and always responded to queries in a very timely manner.

The apartment itself was probably in the best location in Manhattan. Locatated at the heart of all the best restaurants - literally at the corner of the street! Very easy walking distance to both downtown and uptown - 5th ave, Times Square and Soho!

Already cannot wait for my return to NYC and could not recommend this apartment anymore![QWERTY123]The apartment is beautiful and the location is ideal but the most deserved props go to the hosts, Rick and David! 
I so look forward to seeing them again - on either side of the Atlantic!


[QWERTY123]Amazing!!! Location was perfect, Rick was so gracious‎, and the accommodations were awesome.  Highly recommended.[QWERTY123]Rick and David are utterly charming, generous and gracious hosts. Their home is as beautiful as described and immaculate, and ideally located. It's just a couple blocks to the High Line, and close to transit, nightlife, restaurants and great shopping. On my arrival, Rick showed me where everything was, from light switches (there are many) to cooking pots and teacups, and I was invited to help myself to whatever was in the fridge (a glass of orange juice was the perfect start to every day). It was so nice to be able to plug my iPhone into the stereo for my favourite music as I got ready to go out (on surround sound!), and the pullout sofa was very comfortable. Having my own floor was wonderfully private and luxurious, yet Rick and David always made themselves available if I needed them. I felt right at home, and would stay there again in a heartbeat.[QWERTY123]I had a great experience staying with Rick and David. Steps away from all the best restaurants and bars in meat packing, their little bungalow was a great place to land every night.  Very comfortable. Very close to the subway, and they were a wealth of knowledge for me as a first timer in NYC. Thanks guys![QWERTY123]Rick was a fantastic host, he couldn't have been more welcoming and more helpful. The apartment was beautiful and immaculate and you can't beat the location.[QWERTY123]NA[QWERTY123]Rick and David's place is absolutely perfect for the independent airbnb traveler looking for a beautiful, clean place centrally located in Manhattan.  While I didn't have the opportunity to meet David (who was away), Rick was very helpful, friendly, and easily approachable.  He was a great resource for transportation info, neighborhood suggestions and even found me a hair dryer (I'd forgotten mine)!  The apartment is terrific and the living space was quiet, private and extremely spacious.  Breakfast is included and comes with an easy to use coffee system.  I'd highly recommend David and Rick's loft.  Subway easily accessible and walking distance to everything...much better than an apartment, especially when needing to stay in NY for more than a couple days.  
[QWERTY123]I had a wonderful stay at David and Rick's place.  It is a beautiful apartment in a fantastic location, close to the subway, restaurants and shops.  The room is very comfortable and incredibly spacious.  Rick was a great host and is a friendly, interesting person.  He bought me the cereal I like for breakfast, lent me a hairdryer and gave me excellent tips on where to eat, as well as comparing notes on broadway shows.  Thanks for a great stay and I hope to see you again one day![QWERTY123]We stayed at David & Rick's place for a week. When we were there David was away. Rick was a great host, and the apartment is amazing, very spacious and clean. You have your own private area downstairs with toilet. The location was also superb, close to a subway and right in the meatpacking districts which is a great lively neighbourhood with loads of great bars around the corner. Rick made us feel at home and provided us with great tips for NY. Would definitely recommend staying here![QWERTY123]Our experience with Rick and David was fantastic, we made some new found friends. Rick responded to all messages in a timely manner and answered all my silly questions.   This was our first air bnb experience.

The place was as described and looked as per the photos, couldn't fault a thing and has everything you need, plus more.  The downstairs area is great, bed is soft and warm,plus cable tv and toilet. Upstairs is the bathroom, but this was no problem as the guys had their own area. 

My husband loved the fact there was an expresso machine being from Australia he loves his coffee.

David and Rick made us feel right at home and gave some great tips for NYC as well as great suggestions for restaurants and bars nearby.

The location is fantastic and 3 minute walk to the subway and close to the chelsea markets and the high line. Subway is the best way to get around and so easy and this location is just perfect to get wherever you need to and we felt safe around the area.   Certainly a fantastic place to stay and we can't wait to come back to NYC to stay again.[QWERTY123]Rick and David made my first trip to New York a fabulous experience! When I arrived, Rick greeted me, gave me a tour, made me feel welcome and recommended some places to eat that were close by that had great food at reasonable prices. I went to two of the places he recommended, Corsinos (an italian eatery) and Gaslight Pizzeria. Both had friendly staff and delicious food.

I had the whole bottom level to myself and felt like a celebrity. The room was very clean, neat, richly decorated and comfortable. The room comes equipped with its own thermostat and heat/cool unit so you can adjust it to your comfort level. The bed was perfect for one person, two if you are very fit and like to sleep entwined. The mattress was super comfy which is saying a lot since I tend to have chronic back pain. 

I was pretty busy with work and play and didn't get to interact a whole lot with my hosts. However, the few times I was able to talk to them, I found them genuine, interesting and very friendly. 

I would HIGHLY recommend staying with David and Rick anytime you are in Manhattan. Their place is in a great central location, right in the Meatpacking District which is close to Soho, Chelsea and tons of interesting sights.[QWERTY123]We had a wonderful time staying with Dave & Rick. The apartment is exactly as it appears in the photos, spotlessly clean, beautifully decorated, warm & stylish. The location is fabulous, around the corner from the Chelsea market, the Highline & subway station. And then there's Dave & Rick themselves, who are very welcoming, full of stories & advice, always eager to help & make you feel completely at home. I felt we'd won the trifecta- apartment, location & hosts. Highly recommended[QWERTY123]I had a great time in this apartment. Rick and David took time to chat and share. They also respected my privacy. I had a huge room and two bathrooms for myself. Everything was spotless clean.Thank you very much for your warm welcome.
J'ai passé un super séjour chez Rick et David. Ils ont pris le temps de bavarder avec moi, la chambre et la salle de bains étaient parfaits. Tout était extra propre.[QWERTY123]Amazing. Amazing! AMAZING!! What beautiful people Rick and David are. More than just hosts they are caring friends. The place is immaculate and looks just like the photos, I felt like I knew my way around as soon as I arrived. The room and facilities were everything I could ask for.  And to have laundry facilities is super handy. I can't speak highly enough of Rick and David and there place. Do yourself a favor and stop looking and start booking.[QWERTY123]We could not ask for better hosts! David and Rick made us feel so comfortable and we felt at home straight away. The apartment is beautiful just as shown in the photos. The location is perfect, close to transport, food and amenities.The house was in immaculate condition with a very modern setup.

But what made this beautiful loft home was David and Rick. Right from when we entered the house they made our stay so comfortable and easy.They were very helpful and gave us tips on where to go for great food and attractions. 

David and Rick we thank you for welcoming us to your home and are looking forward to our next visit to NYC.







[QWERTY123]David & Rick were extremely accommodating and made sure I felt right at home in their wonderful neighborhood.  Everything from local recommendations to in-house snacks and kitchen sharing!  The sleeping area offered a nice respite from the city when it came time to get some rest.  Next time in New York give these two a try- you won't regret it.[QWERTY123]David and Rick are lovely. They helped me settle in  quickly and easy, giving me information which made life easy. The room is amazing. It's spacious which is unheard of in New York. The location of the apartment is in my favorite part of New York. Trains are closely if you can't be bothered walking. I would definitely stay again next time.[QWERTY123]Super expérience ! David et Rick sont très accueillants et disponibles pour des conseils sur les derniers endroits à la mode ou les sorties à faire dans ce quartier très vivant. L'appart est un peu sombre mais décoré avec beaucoup de goût.[QWERTY123]Had a wonderful experience staying at this gorgeous apartment. Rick and David could not have been more friendly or welcoming. They made me feel at home straight away at their beautiful place (the pictures don't really do it justice). The apartment is amazingly spacious and private, close to great dining and shopping and the subway is a 2 minute walk away which is very handy. I would highly recommend staying with Rick and David, I know I definitely will again when I'm back in NYC.[QWERTY123]I cannot adequately descibe how amazing it was to stay with Rick and David. It was so awesome and I think I can say I have made some new friends.  The apartment is absolutely stunning. As per the pictures, it is immaculate, very large and everything has been thought of. I had my own space downstairs, it was quiet, it was warm, I had a little bathroom to use down there as well as the bath/shower upstairs. I had use of the fabulous gallery kitchen and Wifi.  The location is super. It is 5 mins to subway and 10 mins up to Time Square, 20 mins up to Central Park but with shops all around, the Chelsea markets, and so close to the Hudson River, Greenwich and the Piers, I happily ventured out on foot all the time with plenty to see. 
David and Rick were so helpful, warm and inviting and we even found we had Adelaide people in common so that was just a huge bonus. 
I will definatly be going back in the future.[QWERTY123]David and Rick welcomed us with open arms right from the beginning. They are both incredibly friendly and their home is absolutely beautiful. The location is perfect. Less than a five minute walk from the subway to get almost anywhere in the city. The home itself has a very warm atmosphere. The room that guests stay in is downstairs and it is easy to come and go as you please. Guests also have access to 1 and 1/2 bathrooms with great water pressure and cleanliness. We couldn't have asked for a better place to stay. We would highly recommend their home to anyone- from toursists to those interested in local hangouts as well. Our experience would not have have been the same without suchl a wonderful home and hosts. 
[QWERTY123]Wow! There is a reason everyone gives this accommodation 5 stars, it's PERFECT. Location, Location, Location....... , Huge, beautiful, meticulously decorated downstairs of a duplex just for you and fantastic hosts. David greeted me most mornings and evenings. He gave me hints and tips of what to do where to go etc. It was just the right amount of interaction. David & Rick are really great hosts. You will never stay in a hotel after staying here :-)[QWERTY123]Staying at David and Ricks was like staying with old friends. They made us feel welcome from the moment we walked through their front door. They shared their vast knowledge of New York and also their hidden gems. The space downstairs was very comfortable and the location is fantastic. Thank you for an amazing experience Rick and David![QWERTY123]Jeg og en veninne bodde hos David og Rick i en uke. De er veldig hyggelige og de hadde mange gode tips til hva vi kunne finne på i nabolaget. Nabolaget de bor i er sjarmerende med shopping, vintagebutikker, restauranter og barer rett utenfor døren. De bor også like ved en t-banestasjon, noe som er veldig praktisk for å bevege seg rundt i resten av byen. I leiligheten så disponerer man hele kjelleren - så der er det eget bad, sofa og TV med stereoanlegg, tilgang på vaskemaskin og et eget piano(!). Jeg anbefaller et opphold hos dem på det sterkeste![QWERTY123]David and Rick, excellent hosts. The appartment has a perfect location. You can practically walk everywhere. The subway station is just meters away. The Chelsea market one block away. Amazing place to eat!
The appartment is very comfortable and cozy![QWERTY123]Right from the start, Dave & Rick are extremely welcoming! Dave gave me a tour of the place and gave me some suggestions on things to do during my stay. Dave was extremely helpful with all of my questions about what to do during my time in nyc and even gave me some great suggestions that made my trip very pleasant. If you're lucky, Dave may even invite you to go out to show you some of his favorite local places! The 2nd floor of the apartment was at my full disposal, and very comfortable. The apartment is impeccable and I had full access to everything in the kitchen. But really made my whole airbnb experience were the hosts Dave & Rick, who were such nice, genuine people. This was my first time using airbnb & I won't even give it a second thought to book again with them when I'm back in the city. The only regret you will have is if you don't book your stay with them. So with that said start booking![QWERTY123]I had a really amazing stay at Rick and David. Love the house, the position. Everything perfect.[QWERTY123]Exactly as described and more. Both David and Rick were amazing hosts, and made my first ever airbnb experience a breeze. Lots of aces with this place, but the location was the best part for me - I couldn't have asked for a better place to stay. I would definitely come back on my next trip back.[QWERTY123]David and Rick are fantastic hosts! David gave us tips of what to do where to go etc. and he took us to his favourite places. The apartment is an awesome place on a perfect location. It's exactly as you see in the pictures. Very close to Chelsea Market, Highline and Subway.  We would definitively come back. Thanks David and Rick! #6STARS![QWERTY123]David and Rick's home is simply awesome.
Perfect location, ideal set-up, privacy, comfort, with charming, helpful, generous hosts. 
A welcome haven in the West Village bustle. This is a gem![QWERTY123]This has been one of my best Airbnb experiences. From our initial communication to my stay, Rick and David made me feel so welcome. I had the whole bottom floor including a very comfortable sofa bed with a nice thick mattress, lounge area and small bathroom. Upstairs I had my own bathroom with shower. I could also help myself to breakfast and coffee which was really kind. I had a lot of privacy but also enjoyed chatting with Rick and David when our paths occasionally crossed. The location was perfect for all my sightseeing and great restaurants nearby too. I am so very grateful to both Rick and David and highly recommend their apartment.[QWERTY123]It was my first time using Airbnb, and it has been amazing experience! Rick and David offer an amazing place. It is spacious and private, with all amenities available. The location is exceptional, with the Chelsea Market, the Village, the new Whitney Museum, the High Line and entrance to the Subway only minutes away. I can't recommend this place highly enough. I'm sure my first time here will not be the last! Thanks Rick, thanks David![QWERTY123]If you're looking to stay in town - this is the place to be! Not only do you have a immaculate private room - you have amazing hosts; super friendly, and will help point you in the right direction if you're looking for suggestions. I personally think this is better than any hotel around here. I'm staying here next time I visit![QWERTY123]This was my first Airbnb experience and I have to say the bar has been set mighty high. Everything you have read is %100 true. All the superlatives seem to have been used already and rightly so. This is stylish, gorgeous, welcoming accommodation. As are your hosts. Charming, witty, warm and generous.  My fabulous first time in New York began with the great good fortune of staying here with David and Rick. I did my darnedest to do and see as much of the big apple as humanly possible in 14 days and couldn't have had a better base to do it from nor a nicer reception for coming home to tell the tales. If you could travel the globe sharing even briefly the lives and homes of folk of this calibre what a charmed existence that would be. See you again my friends.[QWERTY123]David and Rick are AWESOME! 
Super accommodating, very welcoming, warm and friendly - just all around lovely and interesting people.

Their house is in a great location! Walking distance to public transport and heaps of restaurants and shops.

The room is very private and comfortable - enough space for all my items.

Would definitely have no problem staying there again!

Thanks David and Rick![QWERTY123]Rick and David are just so very very very very very nice! David even invited me to his birthday party. 

Room is large, exactly as in pictures. As it is in the basement, there is no window, but air condition cools the air. Own bathroom is very nice to have. Building has very cool public rooftop!

Location is unbeatable, West Village/Meatpacking District, very close to Chelsea Market.

Can only highly recommend to stay here!

Dear Rick, dear David, thank you so much for making me feel at home at your place![QWERTY123]One word - fabulous! 

David and Rick were the most gracious of hosts. The apartment was stunning and is exactly like the photos. 

Great hosts, great apartment and now two new friends. I'd recommend this apartment to anyone. 
Graham x[QWERTY123]Wow! There are not enough words to describe how amazing our first Airbnb experience has been. David and Rick are astonishing hosts that will go out their way to accommodate you. Apart from being extremely cordial, they will give you suggestions on what to do and in our case even invite you for a night out with them. The loft is exactly how it is depicted in the pictures. Very clean, stylish and organized is how you will find your temporary home. The room has a very relaxing environment which is crucial after a long day of shopping and taking pictures in the city. The neighborhood bursts with restaurants, galleries, retail stores, bars and breath taking views. As far as transportation there are plenty of train stations nearby in addition to the taxis and Uber drivers that can be found in the streets at any given time. I cannot stress how great David and Rick are, I have a strong feeling this is not the last time we will see each other. Thanks for the opportunity guys stay in touch.[QWERTY123]For the last week, I haven't just had a place to stay, I've had a home for a week. Some people are just made to be good hosts, and David and Rick are two of those people. The apartment? Stunning. The location? Perfect. I'm beyond grateful that these people exist in a city like this, and for their help in making this trip an amazing one. If you're looking to spend any sort of time in Manhattan, please do yourself a favour and book this place. Except don't book it when I want to be in town! 11 out of 10![QWERTY123]***BEST LOCATION***
***BEST PEOPLE***
***BEST EXPERIENCE***

From the moment we walked in we were blown away by our apartment and our hosts Dave and Rick. We arrived in the evening and they were so so welcoming. The photos do not do it justice, it is a massive space to rent of these guys, and a great feel. Also exceptionally clean. 
They were both so helpful with our week stay in New York. Directions, suggestions, do's and donts  and anything we asked if them they we happy to help. I honestly don't think our trip would have been as memorable without Dave and Rick and their beautiful apartment.[QWERTY123]What can I say that hasn't already been said?!  I'm not quite sure as this was truly the best Airbnb experience we could have hoped for.  To start with, David and Rick's apartment is in the best possible location with only a short walk to the Subway, shops, fantastic restaurants, bars, Chelsea Market, The High Line and so much more. Their apartment is just beautiful, immaculately presented and super clean.  I agree with the other reviews saying that the photos don't do it justice.  It's much bigger in reality and the downstairs area that was ours for 9 nights was completely private, spacious but cozy and again immaculate in every way.  David and Rick went above and beyond to welcome us and help make our stay as amazing as possible.  They were always available to recommend fantastic places to visit, eat and drink.  Staying with David and Rick in their beautiful home definitely made our first trip to New York so much more unique and special than if we had stayed at a hotel. We felt like such locals by the end of our holiday that we didn't want to leave :-)[QWERTY123]Phenomenal hosts. Very welcoming, great place, wonderful arrangements. Guided me on all about NYC, took me partying in a day and were very very responsive to everything before and during my stay.

Looking forward to my next NYC visitz[QWERTY123]Upon arriving at David and Ricks apartment we were blown away at the amazing loft the would be our NYC home over the Christmas break. The house was picture perfect, very clean and we had plenty of supplies to last the 13 days we were staying. The whole bottom floor including a living room, bathroom, laundry and bedroom had plenty of character and beauty. Not to mention the fact that we were in the best location in NYC, still close to all of the tourist attractions but very much amongst the trendy atmosphere of the Meatpacking district. While we were unable to meet David and Rick, David fully prepped us and left us a guide to the household as well as recommendations of great places to eat and party! We can not think of a better place to stay in NYC. The experience was definitely heightened becasue of our amazing accomodation and we would highly recommend it![QWERTY123]Staying with David & Rick was the best decision we made for this trip. The location, the hospitality, the apartment & the hosts themselves were all 5-star. For fun-loving people looking to experience New York at its pulsating centre, this is the apartment for you.[QWERTY123]The reviews were correct, David & Rick were amazing. Great private space downstairs which is an amazing sanctuary after exploring the best of what New York has to offer. David and Rick took me out many times to experience the life of a real New Yorker and not just a tourist. They gave me plenty of tips of what to do and what to see, helped with getting tickets to events and even cooked for me a few times. A great experience and have made friends for life. The location couldn't have been better with easy access to transport and easy walking distance to heaps of great restaurants/bars/cafes and shopping. Sad to be leaving but will be back again and i know where ill be staying again next time.[QWERTY123]I had an amazing time at David and Rick's place. They were great hosts and gave me great recommendations on where to visit and eat. Their place is really close to the subway and in a great part of New York. Highly recommended and would definitely stay here again if I come back to New York![QWERTY123]David and Rick were the friendliest guys you can imagine- it was like staying with 2 friends! The neighboorhood was the best possible place to stay in- close to everything. The apartment was spacious and clean.[QWERTY123]David and Rick are super nice person! I really love to stay with them, the place for guest is very private and convenient! Good position and safe place( I'm traveling by myself) so nice apartment and people. I'd like to stay with them next time:)[QWERTY123]Had a great stay in nyc thanks to david and rick great  place great location  took care of everything that was needed definitely would stay again[QWERTY123]Séjour parfait. Hôtes sympas et disponibles. 
Appartement très grand et confortable, et situé dans un quartier fort sympathique[QWERTY123]Rick and David were great and their place was wonderful. It is located in the perfect neighborhood with easy access to a lot of great restaurants and bars. They were the perfect hosts. This was my first time staying at a place where the owners were actually in the place as well. I wasn't sure if I was going to like it but It was actually really nice. You have the whole downstairs to yourself with a half bath and then a shower upstairs in a full bath that is also just your own. They allow you full access to the kitchen but I did not take advantage. I was there for work and had my breakfast and lunch there and then went out for dinners. The place is also very quiet. I got off work early one day and went back to the house and took a nap. Slept like a baby cause it was so quiet. The place is kept up very well clean and nice and the bed is actually very comfortable. I would definitely stay there again and I'm already trying to figure out a time I can come back for pleasure instead of work so I can relax and hang out more. 
I can't think of anything they could improve on. We met up when we said. I was provided with all the info I needed and was on my own. I think their place is perfect for a single person or a couple. I plan to bring my wife back soon and I'm sure we will be staying here.[QWERTY123]Beautiful place, and very welcoming hosts. Also saved me at the last minute on arrival in NYC, which was hugely appreciated.[QWERTY123]This is an absolutely stunning apartment in an excellent location. You are in the heart of the Meatpacking District with everything within walking distance. 
The area is safe and very vibrant with great restaurants and bars and if you're looking for a nightlife scene then this is probably the best place for it. For those who don't want to party, this place is within a stone's throw of great places to eat and the stunning Greenwich Village. 

The building has a conceirge desk which was a nice to have. They were very friendly and helpful.

The hosts were fantastic and although we missed them on this trip, they were ever so helpful and we were made to feel very comfortable.

The perfect place for your trip to NYC.[QWERTY123]Wow, it is hard to describe the amazing experience we had at David's and Rick's place. from the minute they opened the door they were welcoming and warm. their apartment is beautiful and the location is Perfect!. everything was clean comfortable and again - welcoming. they are good people and we had great talks. we had a chance for them to show us around and have a few drinks. we ate a lovely dinner with them and through the entire stay we just felt lucky that we booked their place. we warmly recommend to book it! thanks again David and Rick for an amazing time![QWERTY123]Rick and David are tremendous hosts... hence all the fantastic reviews! Great location, easy access to public transportation, walkable fun area. The space is quiet and private, had the best sleep of my life! :)[QWERTY123]Thanks to David and Rick my NYC visit was flawless, thanks guys.[QWERTY123]David and Rick are the best hosts Airbnb has to offer. Great people! Their place is quiet, clean, and cozy. I slept like a baby every night I was there. It's in a great location, too. I highly recommend staying here next time you're in Manhattan![QWERTY123]David and Rick were amazing hosts throughout the weekend we stayed. They were very helpful and generous with their house as well as the food and drink they provided us. The location of their place is very nicely located in West Manhattan with lots of amazing places to eat as well as areas to visit. It was a perfect first visit to NYC and David and Rick contributed to that![QWERTY123]A fantastic place to stay, david and rick are super friendly and welcoming. The location is really convenient and easy to get to subway stations and walk around. Would recommend to anyone![QWERTY123]David and Rick have a beautiful place in a perfect location. There's so much to do nearby, and they were beyond helpful with recommendations! 10/10 would recommend.[QWERTY123]Absolutely amazing stay! It became clear to me very quickly after arriving why Rick and David's place has such fantastic reviews.
The location was great - close to the subway and places like Chelsea Market, Meatpacking District and the High Line.
The mattress and pillows were unbelievably comfortable and there was no street noise, which made it so easy to sleep.
Apartment had all the amenities you could ask for - heating/air conditioning, full kitchen, laundry, private bathroom and lounge with cable tv.
The best thing about this apartment though is Rick and David. They were so friendly and welcoming.
I will definitely be staying here again on my next visit to New York![QWERTY123]Excellent location and amenities - delightful hosts[QWERTY123]Beautiful apartment in an awesome area of New York. It's a few mins walk to high line, Chelsea market, roof top drinks at the Bain standard and so many amazing places to eat and drink. It's very close to subway so if your going further afield it's easy to get around. We only met Rick as David was away with work. He could not have been more friendly or helpful. Really lovely guy and really lovely place.[QWERTY123]What a fantastic location, right in the heart of the Meatpacking district and easily accessible to the subway system. The apartment is on the ground floor of a classy, secure building complete with doorman and roof garden. Inside it is modern, well equipped and spotlessly clean. The Airbnb accommodation is in the basement of apartment, it is nice and comfortable and extremely spacious but it doesn't really have natural light. David was away during my stay but Rick was very helpful and welcoming and I thoroughly enjoyed chatting with him each day.[QWERTY123]This is a luxe experience hosted by two very friendly and welcoming people. Rick was my host as David was out of town until the last day but they clearly both know how to make people feel welcomed. I enjoyed my week-long stay very much and am grateful for the experience.[QWERTY123]I had a fabulous time with David and Rick. They were great hosts! This was exactly the kind of airbnb experience I love, where you actually meet and get to know wonderful people. They were warm and welcoming, which set the tone for a great experience in the city. The space itself is separate from the main living area, with tons of room - a perfect mix of privacy and hospitality. I'd stay with them again in a heartbeat and recommend anyone who's visiting Manhattan to do the same.[QWERTY123]Great place to stay in perfect location for the best parts of Manhattan.  It's as in the pictures, but it is the hospitality that makes this place so special. I felt like a local and a friend.

It's in the basement which is good for quiet and it's a huge space. You have a half bath but have to go up to your private main bathroom. No problem. Not much natural light but that helps sleep, and you're so welcome upstairs it is no issue. The building is great with a roof terrace too.

Thank you for a great stay and one of the friendliest Airbnb I have been to. Your local knowledge and evenings out were fantastic![QWERTY123]David and Rick welcomed me to the city with open arms! I was here for a bit of work and fun and looking for a place to live when I move here in a month. D&R were beyond hospitable and welcoming and gave me lots of great tips. I had a very comfortable stay and got some of the best nights of sleep of my life. 

Great location near lots of restaurants, Chelsea market, the high line and easy walk to West Village and Union Square, where I spent most of my time. 

What an enjoyable experience. I highly recommend and will tell my friends and family to stay here when they visit me![QWERTY123]I've done lots of Airbnb's in NY and this has to be the best.  First time I've had my own floor.  Rick and David's home is great, the location is fantastic, and they are two engaging gents.  Two thumbs up.[QWERTY123]The host canceled this reservation 2 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.[QWERTY123]My husband and I had never been to New York, nor had we ever stayed at an Airbnb. I had actually never heard of them before. And we have to say  David and Rick definitely raised the bar. We absolutely loved staying at there place. It was tastefully decorated, clean, quiet, and beautifully cozy. When we got to there place we where greeted by a doorman, David welcomed us with open arms  showed us around and we got quickly nestled  in. The building was clean, secure quiet and we felt more than safe. They asked several times if we were o.k or if we needed anything. They had everything we needed. We ate out as we wanted to experience some great New York food but we would have been more than welcome to cook a meal in the shared kitchen that was always kept clean and well equipped. We went to a local market that they had suggested and got some snacks but they were more than generous and told us to help our selves to whatever we wanted in the fridge that was well stocked. 
Well besides having all the amenities we needed and more, We loved the fact we were staying with locals to the area, and what a great location loved it. Everything was close by market, liquor, subways, shopping, and great entertainment. David was more than happy to make some excellent suggestions for places to eat and go out and ways to get around the city. What a great experience David and Ricks is a must stay at if you are travelling to the big apple they are every bit as welcoming and pleasant as their picture shows . We give them a 10 out 5 thumps up.[QWERTY123]I wish I could give David and Rick more than five stars. I stayed here during a business trip when every single hotel in Manhattan was at least $400/night (Note to self: don't schedule meetings in NYC during the UN General Assembly). At $156/night, David and Rick's place is an incredible value. The location is ideal--close to the A, C, E train and L train to get across town, and close to Chelsea Market and a million bars, restaurants and cafes. I will definitely stay here again when I am in New York, and recommend it highly whether you're in New York for business or pleasure![QWERTY123]I can only confirm the very positive reviews here. Rick and David are outstanding hosts and they really made me feel welcomed and I felt very comfortable at this place. The apartment is as described and pictured - spacious, stylish and spotless clean. The basement space is like an Aladdin's Den :) I slept like a log:)) Excellent location! Only 1 block from the subway and right around the corner from the Chelsea Market, everything on your doorstep! 
Highly recommended! 
Thank you guys for making my stay a memorable one;)[QWERTY123]Loved the place and their hospitality. The place is as seen from the pictures. Great location for the apartment, one block to public transit and around the corner from Chelsea market.[QWERTY123]Great location, comfy and private. Very laid back hosts. Would definitely stay here again![QWERTY123]When I walked downstairs into what would be my ""home space"" for the next six nights, I was kind of flabbergasted.  I had seen the pictures online but they didn't do the space justice.  I felt like I'd been transported to a seraglio in Morocco or somewhere, but one with a beautiful baby grand, lots of books, super comfortable gigantic sectional with amazing pillows, a big entertainment center, light fixtures from Egypt that I loved just looking at, and a bed on a kind of ""dais"" where I would sleep like a baby every night.  It's the most fun & spacious Airbnb space I've ever had the pleasure of staying in.  And Rick And David were fabulous hosts: generous, helpful, fun and easy to be around.  I had a great week!  
They provided cold bottled water, and told me to help myself to coffee, tea, breakfast makings and treats, which was just lovely for me since I hated leaving the house sometimes!  I was in NY to perform my solo show, and they even lent me a fabulous pitcher to use onstage the night of my reading.  And helped me get my costume cleaned quickly and very well!  Love these guys!
My only suggestion might be that since the half-bath downstairs in the space is so incredibly large, they might want to add one of those new freestanding bathtubs so that the guests don't even have to bother their hosts upstairs when going to shower or take a bath.  They're about to recarpet downstairs, so it will be even nicer for future guests!  I can't recommend David & Rick's place highly enough; if you're looking for a unique, private, comfortable space in a fabulous location, stay here![QWERTY123]Wow, what a great find. Above and beyond our expectations. The hosts were the 'icing on the cake'. This is a great neighborhood and location. We were able to walk to most of the places that we visited in NYC. All of the recommendations by Rick and David were great. Make sure to visit Smalls Jazz bar when you visit. Whitney Art Museum is a must, it's the neighborhood with great views of the lower city area and Jersey city. 
Would definitely book this place again.[QWERTY123]David and Rick are awesome hosts!  Great location and very responsive.  Their place was better than home away from home!  Lots of private space and very welcoming.  On a scale of 1-10 I give them a 15![QWERTY123]Honestly this is the best Airbnb I’ve stayed at in terms of location and overall beauty. Very quiet space (almost impossible to find in NYC) and accommodating hosts. David and Rick were incredibly accommodating and the location was perfect. 10/10[QWERTY123]Muy lindo lugar , muy buena gente , muy recomendable[QWERTY123]A very nice place to have as base for the theater district and Meatpacking scene. Rick was very friendly with great suggestions for things to do and eat as well as local transportation. Very clean and easy access. The only downsides are shower up stairs and smaller but comfortable bed. Very good value and would stay there again if we ever are able to get back. Thanks Rick for a great stay and hope to meet David next time![QWERTY123]David and Rick’s place is a great place to stay!  It was like staying in a romantic Morrocan hideaway with all the modern conveniences one could ask for.  We had complete privacy when desired and free rein in the shared kitchen area.  Everything was spic and span. Rick and David were friendly and gracious hosts who made themselves available to us when needed and provided wonderful information about the history of the area as well as interesting places to check out.  We are looking forward to our next visit![QWERTY123]I loved staying at David & Rick's place. 
The amenities were fabulous and I loved how well I slept and how private my room was.
I was able to focus on my work which is what I was there for.
David & Rick were fabulous hosts. I loved getting to know them and truly felt comfortable and welcomed into their beautiful home.
Thank you both for allowing me to stay.
I will certainly be back!
[QWERTY123]Great location next to Chelsea Market! Easy to get to so many places.  Friendly hosts provided beverages including great coffee, bottled water and beer. Thank you![QWERTY123]Great location, close to all subway lines in West Village.  Close to everything.  Private lower floor.  Good value.[QWERTY123]Fantastic Airbnb.  Great location.  Close to subways, Hi- Line & Chelsea markets.  Excellent amenities provided from kitchen, washing machine & drying facilities.  Very comfortable,  private and stylish.
David is a very kind, generous host & we immediately felt comfortable with him. We had a few rainy days & David provided umbrellas, warm jackets etc.  He gave us great tips on food places, music spots & things to do while in NYC.  We did not get to meet Rick.  However communication with Rick was excellent. 
Terrific value. Most highly rated Airbnb.  It would be hard to find better.[QWERTY123]Rick and David were great! Just a block away from the subway and close by to so many things! They were great hosts and helped us find where we needed to go![QWERTY123]Had the best Airbnb stay ever at David and Rick's! The location was perfect for me (a 3 minute walk from my office). The room/floor was the classiest Airbnb I have stayed in. To top it of, David and Rick are amazing hosts. 

PS: David, I listened to your album on my way back and loved it![QWERTY123]David and Rick's place was quite comfortable, the downstairs having a great feel and on an extremely quiet street, not typical in NYC.  Plenty of room and with access to the upstairs to shower and have a cup of coffee it was perfect.  The location was ideal for us, near the Highline, short walks to great restaurants and jazz clubs.  We can't recommend it highly enough, thanks to two great hosts! John&Julie[QWERTY123]Perfect Apartment! Perfect Rick and David. Really appreciate for your care to Ray.  Look forward to seeing you in near future.[QWERTY123]Location: This place has a very convenient location, with Chelsea Market being almost right across the street. Subway station is there at the end of the street and neighborhood is full of restaurants, bars and markets. If you want to go for a let evening stroll, High line is close by. 

Space: Super spacious compared to match box size rooms that you get in typical NYC hotels. 

Decor & Amenities: Tastefully done place with a very cosy feel. Fully equipped kitchen, washer, dryer are all for your use. Wifi was good as I could take video calls for work right there.[QWERTY123]Wonderful host[QWERTY123]David and Rick’s appartment is a real good place to stay for a few days in NYC.  We enjoyed our private and spacious room downstairs. It has no real daylight, but that was no problem for us as we were out most of the time. The appartment is very near the subway, the highline and the Meat Pack district. David and Rick made us feel at home and were very helpful![QWERTY123]Really enjoyed my stay with David & Rick, their place is lovely. Great location for exploring downtown and they had a wealth of suggestions for food and activities for my stay.[QWERTY123]David and Rick’s place is an absolute treasure.  The location is perfectly situated around a lot of great places to go and see, wether you are interested in food, the sights, night life, or just relaxation.  Both David and Rick were exceptional hosts who I would even call amazing friends now, they went above and beyond to help us find things to do or advice where to go.  We have not had a better airBnB or vacation experience than what we had here with David and Rick!  I would recommend this place to anyone thinking of spending time in New York.[QWERTY123]Great location!!!!!![QWERTY123]Wonderful and vibrant home. I had the entire downstairs to myself. Next time I come to nyc I will stay here again.[QWERTY123]This was my first time using Airbnb and I didn’t know what to expect. Rick and David’s place and hospitality completely surpassed expectations. If it’s available, I’d definitely book here.[QWERTY123]David and Rick are the consummate hosts. Friendly, engaging and very responsive.  Even the doormen were charming![QWERTY123]Generous hosts in a lovely setting"	40.7413791415638	-74.00196685879914	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/18728	3	150.0	0.833333

I had a very good time.[QWERTY123]nice[QWERTY123]Cynthia was a fantastic host.  Her place was cozy and meticulously clean.  It was also beautifully and artistically decorated in Cynthia's own personal style.  In many ways i thought the place was a work of art in itself.  The bed was also very comfortable.  Cynthia went out of her way to be both a helpful and welcoming host and she cooked some fantastic and healthy meals. The area is also great for shopping and food.  My stay at Cynthia's was a very pleasant, comfortable and enjoyable experience.[QWERTY123]Cynthia's apartment was absolutely beautiful. It is definitely a work of art and reminiscient of a life-size doll's house. It is in a lovely, quiet location, and just one block from the 6 train an buses, which take you pretty much anywhere you want to go. I stayed here with 5 other girls and although there was a good amount of space, it got messy very quickly, so I would definitely recommend a smaller group. Especially because Cynthia likes to keep the place meticulous at all times - and rightly so! She was a very good host and kind enough to show us around the neighbourhood on our arrival. Staying here definitely enhanced our fabulous NYC experience![QWERTY123]Cynthia was an amazing host- You will love her place, it is beautiful! She made us a delicious, healthy breakfast. She was helpful and went out of her way to help us find great things to do while we were there. Good neighborhood, we felt safe walking back at 2am. We would love to stay with Cynthia again...fantastic experience.[QWERTY123]Cynthia was very friendly and helpful. Her place is beautiful and very clean. Easy to get to and a good neighborhood. I would absolutely stay there again.[QWERTY123]What can I say about Cynthia?
We stayed at her apartment for 3 nights & it was fantastic. I booked it at very short notice and was slightly worried as I was travelling with my 11 year old daughter and hadn't been to NY for 20 years but I had nothing to worry about, Cynthia went out of her way to make sure we were comfortable and happy. She is the perfect hostess & we felt we were staying with family than renting a place.
The apartment is amazing & oozes style. The location is great with Central Park a few blocks away & the Subway round the corner. Thank you Cynthia it was a real pleasure to meet you & you made our NY experience a lot more pleasurable. 
I wouldn't hesitate in recommending this apartment hope to return again soon! :)[QWERTY123]This worked out just perfectly for our quick weekend in NYC. With free parking on the street and the train just a block away, we were able to get around quickly and easily, and Cynthia's place is gorgeous, clean, and comfortable. She's an artist whose stunning work is everywhere in the apartment, and we loved hearing about her work, too.[QWERTY123]absolutely the best experience I've ever had at Airbnb. Cynthia's place is AMAZING... it's spacious, impeccably clean, peaceful and a one of a kind artistic space. She has remodeled the space and added her artistic touches to just about every square inch-- and it's done very well. Additionally, Cynthia is a great host and goes out of her way to make sure your stay is the best it can be. The physical location of the place is also superb; half a block away there are restaurants and a CVS, one block away is the subway, grocery store, and specialty produce store. The neighborhood is safe, beautiful and residential with a mix of really good shopping and restaurants a walk away; no need to take cabs. Do yourself a favor and book here, you will certainly enjoy your stay.[QWERTY123]WE HAD A PERFFECT WEEK AT CYNTHIA'S PLACE. THE APARTAMENT IS REALLY CONFORTABLE, CLEAN, WITH EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO MADE A LIVING, AND IN A GREAT LOCATION: TWO MINUTES TO SUBWAY, GROCERIES, PHARMACY... AND ALSO A GOOD PRICE. EVERYTHING WAS PERFECTLY CLEAR WITH CYNTHIA, SHE'S REALLY NICE AND HELPFUL. I CAN'T UNDERSTAND THE COMPLAINTS ABOUT THE DEPOSIT, SHE INFORMED US ABOUT IT, AND HAD NO PROBLEM GETTIN IT BACK. THANKS CYNTHIA.[QWERTY123]Let’s be honest. As a spoiled child who is partial to 1982 Château Margauxs and Nat Shermans, I enjoy the finer things in life. This usually means I stay at the Ritz Carlton and have grown accustomed to be waited on and cleaned up after.

 With that said, this was my first time using AirBnB and to be honest I was absolutely hesitant about “sharing” a room. Fortunately, I stumbled upon Cynthia’s listing and I was instantly intrigued. First of all, Cynthia offers the fairest rate out of all the Upper East Manhatten listings. Other people wanted to charge me twice or triple the amount for run down studios that I could have by myself or maybe share the place with a few cockroaches. Secondly, Cynthia’s apartment is akin to spending a few nights in a Lautner home. She has meticulously designed the bathrooms and the bedrooms so that you are constantly reminded that you are living in a piece of artwork. Finally, Cynthia was a fantastic and attentive host. She knows the city well and was constantly making sure that I was comfortable. (LA people beware: she thinks that walking fifty blocks is normal) I know for certain that if I ever find myself in the city of blinding lights again, I will stay with Cynthia or at the very least invite her out to dinner so that I can dispel her opinions with mine.
[QWERTY123]When experiencing a city as special as NY, its important to experience the people that make the city so special.  Cynthia's home is, in my opinion, the epitome of the spirit of New York.  She puts the same thought and consideration that goes into every piece of her artwork, into every space in her home, combining art and comfort, something that takes a lot of insight to create.  She is also so full of energy and life, so positive, which adds to the excitement of being in New York!  The location is perfect, a block from the 6 train, close to great shopping and restaurants.  She's very accommodating and easy going, a perfect host!  Thank you for everything, Cynthia!  I will be seeing you soon ;-)[QWERTY123]Staying with Cynthia MADE our trip to New York City. Her house is AMAZING. She is AMAZING. And we had the most memorable time thanks to her. First of all, Cynthia's house is a work of art. All the rooms have the 'Cynthia' stamp. Waking up each morning in the beautiful rooms with the exposed brick walls, layers of velvet and contempory artwork masterpieces made us, my mother and I, feel like we were in a dream. The beds are oh so comfortable and Cynthia goes out of her way to make you feel right at home. Everything is meticulously clean and the bathroom is devine! Studying the carefully handcrafted mosaic mirror bathroom you will appreciate all the attention and love she has put into the apartment. I will miss her yummy healthy breakfasts and her warm smile. She is the best tour guide and shared with us the best places to eat, drink and shop like a local. I hope to only stay at Cynthia's when I am in New York City-my time with her was that enjoyable!!! Three days after leaving Cynthia's and I already am missing it!![QWERTY123]Cynthia is just amazing. So helpfull, knows everything about NYC. A wonderful person. Staying with her is the best one can do. I love that girl.
Dennis[QWERTY123]It was just like living in the city!  Close to everything, nice, clean, comfy and safe.
The blue room isn't really that private because you share a window area with the red velvet room and  a sheer curtain with the living room.  The bathroom is amazing and a work of art but the door doesn't close all the way or lock.  I had a restful experience there.  Cynthia is the hostess with the mostest![QWERTY123]I had a fabulous stay with Cynthia. The house is a work of art in itself, and Cynthia was great company. The house is very near the subway so it's easy to get around. Don't hesitate to book![QWERTY123]Great area to stay in and very unique and artistic apartment.  Cynthia couldn't have been more kind to us.  We had the whole place to ourselves, but Cynthia was really helpful in recommending places to go, etc. When two of us found ourselves stranded in New York, Cynthia kindly offered to put us up, despite having another guest due. We didn't have to take her up on the offer, but we appreciated it very much.[QWERTY123]My stay with Cynthia was fantastic and made the NYC experience all the richer. A warm and comfortable retreat from the hustle and bustle of the city. Cynthia is a generous host who provides a wealth of information and was great company. I could not recommend her and her apartment more highly.[QWERTY123]Cynthia`s apartment is a work of art. The place it`s cool, cosy, and extremely clean, a 5 star bed and breakfast located in a good&safe neighborhood surrounded by subway and bus lines, restaurants, antiques, groceries, bank offices, post office, and all sort of shops you can imagine.


Besides all that (plus the fact that the Blue Room is fantastic), Cynthia herself should be considered a NYC must: her amazing company, joy of life and sense of humor will make your stay in NYC be anything less than remarkable (just like it was mine).

in other words: HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.[QWERTY123]I have had the privilege of staying with Cynthia at 97th street for two weeks during my first visit to NYC.

It is no exaggeration to say that her home is by itself, a work of art. Every space is tastefully designed and furnished to combine aesthetic appeal with functionality. The blue room which I rented may appear rather small, but it has everything from a full length mirror, a closet, shelves, vanity top to a working space for the laptop! Cynthia also uses top quality sheets and linen which are extremely comfortable and clean.

Cynthia herself is a delight as a housemate and host. During my stay, I felt more like a longtime friend rather than a short term guest, not once did it feel like a commercial rental arrangement. Cynthia is warm, accomodating and generous, willing to involve you in her
day-to-day activities and events if you so wish. Everything is left as an open invitation, so you will not feel obliged if you already have other plans.

Would recommend to any of my friends without hesitation.

Good luck getting a reservation![QWERTY123]Cynthia  is a very gracious host, and the location is very convenient.[QWERTY123]Cynthia is delightful, and her home is incredibly creative and filled with art and architectural innovations. We unfortunately came at an extremely hot August time, and there wasn't adequate air conditioning. We would highly recommend a visit at any other time of year. Note that Cynthia tried hard to accommodate us with a fan, but we ended up having to move the final night when there would be 4 of us.[QWERTY123]Staying with Cynthia was a pleasure. 

Her home is a work of art, spotless, beautiful and artistic. 
Not only was the setting perfect but Cynthia's friendliness and helpfulness went above and beyond. 
Nothing at all was too much trouble for her and she went beyond her role as host many times, I was apartment hunting during my stay and Cynthia asked her friends, looked online and did everything within her power to help me find somewhere. 

A wonderful woman, you would be lucky to stay in her home. 
[QWERTY123]Friendly and generous host. Convenient location for getting around NYC.  The apartment on E 97th is an artistic upgrade of a traditional NY apartment.  I think most people looking at this site would enjoy staying with Cynthia, and I certainly did.[QWERTY123]Cynthia is a delightful and helpful hostess.  Staying there is like inhabiting a work or art.  One block to subway makes location convenient.[QWERTY123]There is no place like home and Cynthia is the best hostes I've ever know.
She is a friend, a companion and reminds you of the good things in life ;)
The apartament is beautiful and cozy and her greates masterpiece :)
Great sport, will recomend her anywhere in the world!!!

Obrigada!! :D[QWERTY123]Cynthia's apartment is artistic and clean and she was a warm and welcoming host.  The room I stayed in was large and the bed comfortable.  The place was conveniently located near my family so that was a big plus for me. Sharing a bathroom turned out to be OK, but the design of the bathroom sink made it hard to use so I used the kitchen sink instead. All in all, it was a nice place to stay for a few nights.[QWERTY123]Cynthia is an amazing host and her home a beautiful piece of art. I was really impressed with how spotlessly clean the place is. This is without a doubt the best place for the price in all of Manhattan...and nicer I'm sure than most places twice the price.[QWERTY123]I spent 7 fantastic days here and felt at home from beginning to end. The apartment *is* a work of art - there is nothing like it which contributed to make it a unique vacation for me.
Cynthia is a great host and person.[QWERTY123]I don't know if i can praise the experience enough. It is my first time using AIRBNB as well as staying at a bed and breakfast, but I would not stay at a hotel room for my vacation anymore. The apartment is a work of art, Cynthia is a wonderful host, and location awesome. Walking distance to central park and museums there and even shorter walk to the metro.[QWERTY123]I had a wonderful time staying with Cynthia. Her home is truly a work of art and credit to her for the hard work and creativity she has been able to adopt to her amazing home. I enjoyed being a part of her developments for a short time and look forward to a return visit. Her warmth, kindness and positive enthusiasm to life was energising during my stay.[QWERTY123]I really enjoyed staying with Cynthia in her beautiful, thought-provoking home.  Cynthia is an artist, and everything in her home is crafted to be comfortable and beautiful.  Cynthia was a laid-back host -- when I was around, if she happened to be eating or cooking, she shared delicious chicken soups and avacado salads with me.  More enjoyably, we shared numerous conversations and I even got to weigh on decorating choices for the next guests!  Anything I needed for my comfort, Cynthia made sure that I had it, and she was also very laid back around my intensive, early and late scheduling needs.  Cynthia made me feel like an old friend, not a new guest, and when I can next come to Manhattan, I plan to stay at Cynthias.[QWERTY123]Our stay at Cynthia house was excellent. Cynthia was really helpful and helped us when I lost my bag in the shuttle. The room was very nice and the flat is just as the pictures shows, awesome ! The place is just next to the metro station which is very convenient to discover the city. If I had to come back to New York I would definitely choose her place again. Thanks a lot.[QWERTY123]Cynthia’s apartment is a work of art. It was a gorgeous place to stay, very clean, warm and convenient for sight seeing. Cynthia is a wonderful host, supplying plenty of New York info and hospitality. I very much look forward to returning.[QWERTY123]We looked for a true NYC experience when booking Cynthia's apartment and we got it. Cynthia is a marvelous host and presented a truly unique apartment; something of herself that she seeks to share with others.  Cynthia had a genuine interest in us as her guests and treated us like family. We would thoroughly recommend Cynthia's apartment as a base for exploring NYC.  Thank you so much Cynthia.  See you in Oz some time down the track.[QWERTY123]Me and my other half stayed at Cynthias from 28th Dec until 4th Jan 2011. The apartment is in a great location about a ten second walk from the subway, and then a quick route straight down to times square. The area is lovely with a great smoothie shop with cheap prices just round the corner which Cynthia kindly took us to. The apartment itself is AMAZING!! Me and my other half absolutely loved everything about her place it was very homely, clean and just stunning!! After a stressful 18 hour journey thanks to many delays, we arrived in the middle of the night and what a relief to arrive to such a nice welcoming apartment was fantastic. Cynthia is a lovely kind hearted, warm person and we are very grateful to have met her and stayed at her beautiful home. We look forward to visiting again hopefully in the summer :)  

ps... We stayed in the Grand Room, the bed is extremely comfortable and you will get a great nights sleep!![QWERTY123]Cynthia was a wonderful and accommodating host. I stood the first night with my daughter, and we had a blast playing in the loft rooms she created. Nights two and three I was there with my girlfriend and Cynthia was so helpful with recommending places for us to have breafkast and dinner. She even invited us along to an event and dinner on the last evening we were there. We had a lot of great conversation, and I really enjoyed our little walk and talk while we were looking for a cab. I really appreciated her welcoming demeanor, and I'm sure anyone interested in this location will appreciate this quality of hers as well.[QWERTY123]Living in Cynthias fab apartemment was/is luxury and welbeeing from start to end:-) Cynthia greet you as an old friend or a family member, and you will feel right at home.
Cynthia is so easygoing, fun and she takes care of you in a way that I havent experienced anywhere else.
I left her place and felt lke we had been roommates forever, and Im SO going back soon:-)[QWERTY123]Cynthia is a warm, talented, vibrant woman, generous to a fault and an total pleasure to spend time with. Her place is true labour of love, its relaxed and feels very much like home, with central park, top notch but reasonably priced restaurants (the local sushi is great!), the illustrious Madison Avenue for shopping, or more downbeat relaxed third avenue. Transport is excellent. In short, it's all you need. Would highly encourage you to stay with Cynthia - you won't regret it. I'll be staying again.[QWERTY123]The facts of staying with Cynthia are these: her home is as spectacular as the photos suggest; the location as convenient as the map indicates; the hospitality as generous and considerate as other reviewers testify.

The experience of staying with Cynthia is harder to express. I'm back now from five days in New York that might just have changed my life forever. Cynthia's warmth, wisdom and kindliness were a springboard to a rather brilliant adventure that I'm hoping will bring me back to New York, and to this amazing house, again and again.[QWERTY123]Cynthia is an amazing host, she's so welcoming and treats you like family the second you buzz her apartment. I only went to New York for 4 nights and only used the apartment as a place to sleep and leave my bags but even so its been one of the best places i've ever stayed. The apartment it self is in a great location thats quiet, and conveniently located next to 96th street subway which gets you by 5th avenue in 5/10minutes or times square in 10/15minutes. The pictures do not do the apartment justice seeing is believing its like walking into an art exhibition you feel apart of her home straight away. I honestly can write pages upon pages upon pages of how great Cynthia was and how amazing her apartment is but seriously if your even considering booking her apartment do it straight away you wont regret it. I'm already planning my trip back.[QWERTY123]To say that my stay in this beautiful home was a wonderous experience would be understatement.  The place is a beautiful work of art in a wonderous city with a host who went out of way to make me feel at easy with kindness and helpful advice and a welcoming smile.  If all my airbnb experiences are like this I'd be truelly blessed.  Thank you Cynthia.[QWERTY123]I have been at Cynthia's during 5 nights last week (April 2011) and everything has been excellent. She is a great host and the best guide to enjoy the city (as well as her apartment, which is a very nice place to be, a work of art). My name is Diego and I am 34, from Buenos Aires Argentina.
[QWERTY123]Cynthia is a (Website hidden by Airbnb) first Airbnb experience and what a way to start. Extremely accomodating, sociable and caring. The apartment is fantastic and so brilliantly located; I was mainly In Manhatten and walked everywhere. The apartment was very clean, tidy, warm and cosy. I felt at home and safe (as a female travelling on her own I think this is important) Would most definitely book with Cynthia again if in NY. An extremely talented artist too.[QWERTY123]Cynthia's home is very UNIQUE NEW YORK! My friend and I had an amazing time staying with Cynthia. She was an amazing host and a great person to be around. Very helpful and only a phone call away. My friend and I loved her place, it is colorful and creative, and has a story of its own. I can say her home is my favorite place I've stayed in so far. Her location is great, the subway is right around the corner, and Central Park is only 3 blocks away. I truely would recommend others to stay at Cynthia's home. Cythnia thanks for letting us stay at your home we had a lovely time!![QWERTY123]Un séjour parfait !!! Cynthia est une hôte fabuleuse qui s'aura s'adapter à vos envies : si vous avez des questions elle n'hésitera pas à vous aider et à vous proposer des sorties. Si vous préférez vivre votre aventure seul, elle vous laissera faire ce que vous voulez ! L'appartement est vraiment somptueux, en plein upper east side à quelques pas d'une station de métro ! Vraiment idyllique ! Une première à NYC pour ma part, et ça risque de ne pas être la dernière ! Vous pouvez y aller les yeux fermés ![QWERTY123]Best holiday ever, facilitated by Cynthia´s supreme hospitality, warmth and not least her breathtaking apartment. My girlfriend and I enjoyed our stay from start to finish and Cynthia treated us like old friends from the moment we walked in the door.

The location was excellent - just a minute´s walk from the nearest subway. The bed was comfortable and the apartment was spotless throughout. But the greatest plus was Cynthia herself - always smiling and helpful with plenty of great stories to tell and full of interesting ideas for sightseeing and restaurants.

I can´t recommend this apartment highly enough.[QWERTY123]We started our wonderful trip to the big apple with a town car at the airport that was arranged by Cynthia.  Then a warm greeting by our host.  She showed us around her neighborhood and gave us very sound advice about the subways and how to get around.  She prepared us a hearty breakfast every morning and sent cheerly on our way. 
Her apartment is cool, very comfortable, very clean and easy to get to. We had a wonderful time in NYC and she was definitely a contributing factor.
I will stay there again.[QWERTY123]I enjoyed my stay with Cynthia tremendously!!  Her home is more beautiful than I ever imagined.  It was a wonderful experience spending time with her and she is brillant at making her guests feel comfortable.  She offers a warm haven to live that feels like home and her beautiful artwork is a festival for the eyes in every room.  I did not want to leave.  I felt like I was not just a guest, but part of her family. She goes the extra mile to welcoming her guests into her home.   She spent a lot of time helping me get settled and giving me valuable information about places to eat and and have fun.  
This was my first real visit to New York City and Cynthia was a most wise philosopher and guide to the city and to life. I couldn't believe how fortunate I was to have her as my host.   She has so much positive passion and energy about her work and about people and she had a life changing effect on me.  I am thrilled I got to meet her, and  honored to call her a friend.  People like Cynthia do not come around all the time, and when you get a rare opportunity to know them,  PLEASE GRAB IT!!!!!!![QWERTY123]We had a great time staying here!

We had a fairly packed schedule, so we didn't spend much time talking to Cynthia, but she was super friendly, made us feel very at home, and was full of good recommendations.

The apartment is amazing. The photos really don't do it justice, and we loved the kitchen in particular.[QWERTY123]Cynthia is nothing short of awesome!!! Her home is gorgeous, I liken it to a museum yet it's cozy and comfortable too. Cynthia wants only the best for her guests and it shows - super plush towels, soft soft sheets, lots of laughter and if you're lucky, an escapade or two. A few blocks to one of the most gorgeous areas of Central Park and 1 block from a central subway line. Live it up in style and comfort in this fantastic one of a kind experience![QWERTY123]I had a fantastic 4 days staying with Cynthia in her beautifully decorated apartment. Her warm hospitality and caring nature made my stay in New York all the more memorable.  She even invited me to join her for lunch and dinner with her friends, and we had a great time doing some shopping, especially in antique stores!

I highly recommend Cynthia's place when staying in New York.

[QWERTY123]Very nice flat, I felt well at home. She even cooked me a awesome breakfast..... Healthy eating it was indeed. Thank you Cynthia, Awesome host ...... Easy excess into all the main attractions too[QWERTY123]A fantastic stay - Thank you so much!! The apartment is beautiful and Cynthia is an excellent host, always ready with helpful info, or the offer to join her in whatever her plans are. Highly recommended!![QWERTY123]This place is really ""cocooning"".
Cynthia was quick to respond to all of our requests and made her best to make our stay great. She was also very flexible with check-in and out times. We took a shower after our last day in NYC and could let our luggages over there. 
However for us : a family who travels with a child combined with the jet lag (early wake up at 5 am), this is not the most convenient place to stay as we felt uncomfortable to disturb our host. We should have opted for something more anonymous but this is our mistake.[QWERTY123]First, take your shoes off, because you are about to enter holy ground. It's an honor to be in a home with so much love put in it, where you can truly relax. Forget the city you can spend your days exploring all the exquisite craftsmanship that goes in for your pleasure. Central park, the shopping and museums are amazing too, which are walking distance away. But the reason why you'll fall in love with everything New York is your incredible host on E 97th. Save some granola for me. Cynthia, you soulful divine woman you, who had me in stitches most of the time. So people, this is a place and a host who is not to be taken for granted. Only book here if your heart is oversized and you want your experiences inside and out to be Himalayan. Cynthia, you are New York. (Phone number hidden by Airbnb)[QWERTY123]This Property is located in a wonderrful area of the city, I walked to  wonderful coffee and carrott cake shops. I took the trrain eveyday from a subway stop a block away it as great. The decor is just wonderful I love the electic/victorian feel and it was very clean.
Cynthia is a very concerned hostess and makes sure you don't get lost and she offerrs money saving ideas.
My room was nice but if you are suffering from arthtis and hot flashes it  may be a little diffcult climbing up to your loft bed. The steps are higher than normal steps and air circulation is tight. The next time I will rent the grand room.[QWERTY123]Cynthia est une hotesse chaleureuse, agréable, qui fait tout pour que le séjour de ses visiteurs se passe au mieux. Elle vous donnera les informations pour vous rendre autonome dans la ville. L'appartement est charmant, et il est à 5mn de central Park et à 2mn de la station de métro.[QWERTY123]Cynthia is a very warm, gregarious and generous personality and her place is one of a kind.  We were in town but due to lesve the night of Hurricane Irene but Cynthia was flexible in the circumstances and willing to let us stay on if we needed it.  The house is warm, colorful and very social and entertaining, so it would suit travelers seeking a social experience rather than more private types.  We had lots of great moments, and only some minor misunderstandings  (our host was away when we first arrived, which we knew would be the case in advance, but were unsure of just some basic stuff like house rules which then had to be explained when our host returned!). All in all, highly recommended for anyone seeking a social and fun NY experience in the Upper East of Manhattan[QWERTY123]Cynthia is so nice! She met me at the door and helped with my luggage on the rainy night in which I arrived. The next morning ( every morning) she made breakfast or made sure I had something to eat before I headed out for the day. I stayed in the blue velvet room in which I felt I was climbing into a special Moroccan tree house every night. This place is perfect if you need a clean, single place to sleep and shower. You will enjoy the special experience! Good luck![QWERTY123]In one word - WOW! I really had the time of my life during my week staying at Cynthia´s place. This place and Cynthia are amazing. You directly feel this great atmosphere and spirit that sourrounds them when you first enter the door and meet Cynthia. I did not want to leave this place and I will be back soon!!! 
The location of the appartment is absolutely great, the place itself is even much more amazing than the pictures already reveal and Cynthia is a person you should not miss to meet.[QWERTY123]Cynthia is an amazing lady.  Very generous and accommodating with her space.  I highly recommend her flat and would certainly stay with her again.  Super host![QWERTY123]This was my first shared AirBNB experience and it was interesting and enjoyable.  Cynthia is a delightful hostess who made my stay very comfortable.  The bedrooms are not ideal for tall people (like me) but her location is super close to the subway lines and her home is very artistic and clean!  I would stay there again just to hang out with Cynthia![QWERTY123]Cynthia was a fantastic host. By the end of my stay it felt like we were close friends. Her apartment is amazing, literally overflowing with style and character. I highly recommend staying with Cynthia![QWERTY123]Our host provided a clean and well equipped apartment that was perfect for our stay.  All the little touches were well appreciated in this beautiful setting.  Our host provided support and was available if we had any problems.  It was a great stay.[QWERTY123]Cynthia was a wonderful, warm host, she showed us around her area and suggested several restaurants which were excellent.  We enjoyed the location and walked to Central Park several times, used the subway and the buses all nearby.  Thank you, Cynthia.[QWERTY123]Cynthia is great! Can't wait to be back on 10 December![QWERTY123]I had a great stay in NYC by grace of both lovely apartment and charming owner!! The apartment is beautiful, original, peacefully decorative and so agreeable.You have to be careful not to sleep too much there for your sight-seeng in NYC!! The location is Upper east side, near the Subway! very safe area and you can easily walk to the Central Park and the MET! The host owner is very nice, kind and friendly lady! If you love the art, it would be great to meet her!! Why?You can see there..    Perfect for a stay in NYC and moreover,for making a great memory. I'm sure to go back!! Thank you☆[QWERTY123]Cynthia’s endearing comments about Judy and I as her houseguests make my eyes misty.   Staying with Cynthia gave our fabulous trip an added dimension for enjoyment.  Cynthia’s persona is very spiritual to me.  She has a unique quality that captivates you….and she is also funny.

Cynthia’s home had never-ending artistic discovery on a daily basis for us, such as the totally unique water basin, the odd choice of a lamp shade in the kitchen, the mosaic mirrored kitchen back-splash as well as the shower surround, etc.  Cynthia’s highly acclaimed photographic artistry translates to her home décor.

Cynthia’s warmth and kindness were so appreciated as she escorted us around the neighborhood with dining recommendations, subway lessons—which we flunked on our first adventure differentiating UPTOWN vs. DOWNTOWN, but her subsequent tutorial straightened us out.

Cynthia and my traveling companion are twin “neat freaks” as far as cleanliness whereas I required forgiveness from time to time; to wit, the ultimate infraction of  wearing my boots in the house.  However, after Cynthia recovered from the shock to her cleanliness gene, she quickly forgave me with the admonition, “NO SHOES IN THE HOUSE.”

Cynthia’s blended energy drink in the morning enabled me as a 79-year-old broad to keep up with my young sidekick Judy.  Cynthia became our “House Mother,” waiting for our safe return at night with our daily report.

The most surprising revelation on this trip was how sweet and helpful the local New Yorkers  are to tourists.  There is a misconception that New Yorkers are rude, brusque and arrogant.  The opposite is true! In all my travels worldwide, I have never encountered nicer people who go out of their way to help you.

This is one of the beauties about airbnb, you get to meet people that you would not normally get a chance to meet. Carol came with her friend Judy. The 2 took to NYC and rode the tour game in joy and laughter, making the home-towner me see the city again. Carol is also the hero, where love wins the day. She married her high school sweetheart, while now in her late 70's, she wears the smile of a happy ever ending story. I can only hope that more people will get the chance to meet this fabulous woman. Thank you Carol and Judy for staying here, I had fun.
[QWERTY123]I could not expect more than that Cynthia offered me. I got really well along with her, she's a special person. The house is great, I stayed in the blue room, a little cosy one. Great nest where to shelter after myNYC hectic days![QWERTY123]From the moment I saw the photos of Cynthia's apartment in New York I wanted to stay there. She is a fabulous hostess, so helpful and considerate. Nothing was too much trouble for her and I appreciated being invited to some of the activities that she was doing. That was a great way for me to learn more about New York (particularly as I was travelling on my own).
I've often thought about the option of taking an apartment by myself (as I did in Paris last year) but my experiences with Cynthia strongly tip the balance in sharing with an owner, it is so much more sociable and  enjoyable. 
Thanks for your hospitality Cynthia!!![QWERTY123]Cynthia was great! Made me feel at home! She prepared lovely smoothies and fruit drinks every morning to start the day.

I stayed there for 8 nights. Privacy was never an issue until the second room got booked. Made the last couple of nights uncomfortable. 

Overall, excellent place to stay. Cynthia will invite you to meet her friends and welcomes you with such great energy. She's hilarious! Awesome sense of humor. She's extremely easy going and fun to talk to. Her art work is amazing and she'll tell you all about it.

If you ever get sick, or need to stay the day in, she has a variety of films on her Netflex. She's honestly a genuine and lovely person to be around with. I will definitely book her home again.[QWERTY123]I came from France Aix en Provence to stay 8 days in NYC. My trip was a success with Cynthia who gives so much advises when we need. Always she is very helpful and facilitate to come from the JFK Airport or other places you want to visit. Cynthia's apartment in the Upper East and close from subway stations and buses. The home is very clean and quiet, my room was comfortable. After the day in NYC, it is relaxant to come back easily with subway or bus to the home. Cynthia knows to be considerate . I will recommend this place for friends who wants discover NYC and living in one friendly apartment and need help when it is necessary. xavier[QWERTY123]A fantastic and generous host. Very much looking forward to staying with Cynthia again soon.[QWERTY123]Cynthia is a great person to stay with; expect smoothies, art and noodles. Her apartment is appropriately luxurious and you're well situated on the 4-5-6 Metro lines which give you connections to the rest of the city, not to mention being a stone's throw from the bigger galleries and museums of Manhattan. A fantastic few days. Strongly recommended.[QWERTY123]
To meet Cynthia and to stay in her tasteful outfitted appartement was a great pleasure for me. Cynthia is a very sympatic and warm person and she has an amazing positive attitude towards life. She is a wonderful and provident host, helpful in every situation. I had a phantastic and secure time in New York and after tiring tours in 'downtown' I felt like coming home. Her smoothies in the morning are the cherry on top.[QWERTY123]Amazing place and location, i would recommend this place to anyone who is traveling to NYC! the place to stay!  Cynthia was so helpful and she is the most amazing person that you will meet in your travels! THANK YOU CYNTHIA FOR EVERYTHING :)[QWERTY123]stay was wonderful, the place makes you feel home and cosy. cynthia made her famous smoothies every morning. she is a great host. i would recommend her place to everyone. not only because cynthia is so taking care of her guests and beeing helpful in any kind of matters, she just got something, that not everyone has it.[QWERTY123]This is, indeed, one of New York's most-unique destinations.


Cynthia is an internationally-known visual artist with formal architectural training, and her home is the product of 22 years of sustained artistic focus. The photos are accurate but cannot capture a myriad small details such as the elegant solutions for concealing piping and wiring runs, or for ensuring adequate airflow between the lofts and open areas. At one point, I got a glimpse of a concealed wiring closet as she relocated her wifi base station -- I was impressed by the carefully-designed infrastructure that lies beneath the sumptuous exterior. 


As an extra treat, Cynthia's artwork graces the walls. The overall effect is stunning, like living in a bohemian fin-de-siècle palace -- admittedly a compact one, but a palace, nonetheless.


Cynthia herself is the epitome of the perfect hostess.  Her warmth and generosity is beyond compare. Her morning smoothies are the perfect metaphor -- healthy, fresh, and sustaining.  


Living successfully in a small shared place requires the willingness to balance intimacy with privacy, and she handles that balancing act with effortless grace. In the last week of my two-week stay, I fell ill. Cynthia went overboard to ensure that I was comfortable, even to the point of getting chicken soup for me! 


There is a large community of people around Cynthia, some drawn initially by her miniature palace.  I feel lucky to have joined that community.[QWERTY123]I enjoyed staying with Cynthia so much!  She works very hard to  take excellent care of her guests. She offers shelter that not only gives the body rest and renewal,  but also feeds the mind.   If you are lucky enough to get a chance to stay with her, you will never forget this trans formative experience.[QWERTY123]A truly lovely experience! Cynthia's gorgeous home was an excellent base for me to really explore the Upper East Side and her suggestions for the very best places to dine and visit were perfect. Cynthia organised everything seamlessly and she was so helpful that it was very easy to move in and have an excellent week. Thank you Cynthia - I shall return![QWERTY123]I stayed 2 weeks in Cynthia's home, which really is a place of artwork. I spent all days outside and made my daily reports after that in the blue room. I often finished at midnight.  The days were fully planned. So I was happy to be in a place next to the subway. Cynthia gave me some advices, called a taxi for me, and I loved her smoothies in the morning. Thank you for that very much, Cynthia! 

But I would like to point out a few things which should be mentioned. The pictures do not show the true dimensions of the blue room. The blue room is only about 6  square meters bed included. There is only a bench to sit on with no backrest. Stairs lead you to your bed. The bed goes over the floor. The room is open to the ceiling. Underneath is place for your clothes as well as on the opposite side. Real space to live in is therefore very very narrow.  The room is not separated enough. Everybody in the flat can hear everything you say.  There is no privacy in that room. 
There was not a single table with a chair in normal size in the kitchen nor in the living room nor in the blue room. I found a few bar stools in the kitchen, one of them I could use  in my room to reach my laptop. If you prepare your meal in the kitchen you have to eat from the working place sitting on a bar stool or standing. The fridge is too small for more than 1 person if rooms are booked. There is no microwave. The flat is shoe free, but Cynthia did not say that she does not like sandals or slippers. She walks barefoot and wanted me to do so or in my socks. I do not like that.  The place is beautiful, but to pay 95 $ for a room of 6 square meters?  Cynthia is nice at one hand. But she gave me the feeling that she cared at first about every piece in her flat, then about her guest. I would wish to see more respect for the dignity of guests from different countries with different aspects of life. Do I recommend? For people who like such very small places, yes.
[QWERTY123]Cynthia  makes you feel at home immediately , and her home is  a fabulous and special  place to stay when visiting NYC . Her home is  wonderful with thought given to every detail from the mosaic on the kitchen wall, the Aladdin treasure cave rooms ,the gorgeous bathroom and the stunning living room. But even more lovely is Cynthia herself , who takes care of her guests from the morning smoothies to the evening welcome when you return after a day in the city. I feel really  lucky that I stayed with her and will come back next year.[QWERTY123]One amazingly inspiring woman.
A warm and wonderful place with a soul of its own.
An unforgettable experience...[QWERTY123]One of the best things about my trip to New York was meeting Cynthia.  Waking up to her blending her famous 'happy juice' or arriving home to hear about her latest home project after a long day exploring New York was refreshing.  Simply, we clicked like sisters...and were never at a loss to find things to talk about.  As numerous other guests have said, her place is an inspiration to anyone artistic.  It's a continual work in progress with creative ideas flowing.  The two weeks I spent with her flew by.  As it was, we ran out of time for Raman noodles!  If you're looking for a place to stay where you immediately feel like you're with family or a close friend, this is the place.  She's spotlessly clean and graciously attends to any needs you may have.  If I have the opportunity to use Airbnb again, I can only hope I find a host as amazing as Cynthia.  Thank-you 'Mama' for a great introduction to New York.  Until I see you again...  :)

October, 2012[QWERTY123]Cynthia, oh Cynthia. How can I start about her and her lovely home?
Well it all really is perfect. She is a very thoughtful hostess: she makes ‘happy juice’ every day, she is talkative, inviting, patient, interesting and warm.
Her home is just gorgeous, being an Interior Designer myself, I totally fell in love with the whole European flair and uniqueness of this lovely and well located apartment in a safe and nice area in the Upper East.
You just can’t ask for more. An experience I am so thankful for having!
[QWERTY123]As everyone has said, Cynthia's place is beautiful and she is great fun. I regret that I was out and about so much that I didn't have much time to chat.  But that said, the place is perfect for social folks who want to get out and around. It's convenient to the subway, there are restaurants in the area, and the apartment is clean. Cynthia is a wonderful host. It's not the place for someone who wants to spend a great deal of time in their room alone. The room is small (but has plenty of room for all your stuff and a comfortable bed), and even with all the lights on, it's quite dark. But who goes to New York to stay in their room! The living room is wonderful and bright and comfortable, so if you have work to do you can sit in there. I'd definitely stay here again.[QWERTY123]Staying at Cynthia's apartment was an amazing experience, as not only is it perfectly located, but it's a beautiful, restful space to reside in. Cynthia made amazing smoothies every morning, and was a perfect host to hang out with. Everything in her apartment was geared towards making my stay as comfortable as possible. I would definetely recommend her apartment and I would also stay there again. 
You do require some athleticism to climb into the bed space, but this didn't cause an issue for me.[QWERTY123]My stay at Cynthia was simply fantastic. The location could not be better. Only a block away from the subway station. Three blocks away from central park... How about a walk in the park? Yes, please!! Plenty of restaurants, coffee shops (Yes, including Starbucks for those of you who are not willing to support small but great businesses). Cleaners, delis, clothing stores, barber shops... You get my point!. 
The actual place is UNIQUE. I doubt that many places in NYC are as nice as this little apartment. The building, like many in NYC is old but very well kept. Cynthia's apartment is beautiful. Small but so well organized and decorated that every little corner has personality. Cynthia is an artist and she is constantly working on her apartment and expressing her art throughout the entire place. The room is small but I was amazed with how much she was able to accomplish in that little space. She certainly has been able to create the feeling of an entire bedroom in the two cozy niches she has put together. She is a smart and charismatic lady. Always concerned about one's comfort. I enjoyed every conversation I had with her as she did not hesitate to share her thoughts on any given subject. Her fruit smoothies are just great and energetic. The perfect start for every morning. 
I can go on and on about this place but let just put it simply. Go ahead and book. You will not be disappointed. It will add to your whole experience next time you are in NYC.[QWERTY123]Cynthia was the perfect host for me. She took me out and about, showed me around the area and filled me in on pretty much everything that I needed to know for my first time here in New York. Her home is absolutely stunning![QWERTY123]Cynthia was a great host! I really enjoyed my stay. Her home is situated in a great location right by the subway. She was very helpful and gave lots of suggestions for good restaurants. Highly recommend for any traveler.[QWERTY123]Beautiful and comfy oasis in perfect location! 
Cynthia is a lovely, accommodating hostess. Loved waking to smoothies in the morning! Best Cuban coffee is around the corner at Judy's. CVS literally at the corner for any last minute items you might have forgotten. Easy subway access.[QWERTY123]All expectations fulfilled-- beautiful apartment, gracious host, delicious morning smoothie, wonderful conversation, practical help with whatever was needed.[QWERTY123]Cynthia is a very friendly,warm and a very easy person to get on with.She was very welcoming and made my stay in New York city very pleasant.I got a really bad cold when I was in NY,Cynthia really looked after me and made sure I was back on my feet sight seeing again!
Her apartment is a work of art clean and comfortable even her bins are vintage!!!
Love love that apartment ( I still cant decide which is my fav room  between the bathroom,the kitchen or the living room...)
If you are looking for a comfortable,great location apartment with a great friendly host I would def. recommend Cynthia's apartment.
Thanks again Cynthia for making my stay in NY city very memeorable!!!!
[QWERTY123]I had a wonderful time staying with Cynthia! Beautiful apartment perfectly located in a great neighbourhood. As a host, Cynthia is helpful, warm and extremely welcoming and relaxed. I will definitely stay again![QWERTY123]Cynthia was an incredible host. She was warm, and kind, inviting me to gallery openings, taking me for runs on Central Park, and helping me plan my subway rides each day. The house is gorgeous, quiet, and unique. I slept wonderfully in the Blue Room, and Cynthia sweetly accommodated my early to bed, early to rise schedule. I'll be reaching out to her any time I'm in NYC. .[QWERTY123]My second time to NYC & first time solo; also my first time using Airbnb. I am very glad I stayed at Cynthia's. I would highly recommend staying here if you want to get away from the ""touristy"" part of the city & explore the neighbourhoods. She is right in the heart of the Upper East Side. It was a wonderful stay. Here is my review: long & hopefully detailed enough. Cynthia as a host was fantastic. She had booked a car service for me to & from the airport (cheaper than a cab), & greeted me with open arms when I arrived. She immediately struck up conversation; this girl can talk, & her conversations are intriguing & wonderful. She respected that I wasn't a morning person, & kept quiet in the mornings. She let me borrow her umbrella during the one day that it poured. She gave me a subway map & explained the lines to me. She provided me with a list of nearby cafe's, restaurants, & grocery stores. She also gave me the low down on what's up with the museum admissions... I suggest staying with her if you want to know about that as well. Overall, she was very kind & helpful & I appreciated it all. The apartment itself looks exactly like the photos & is so thoughtfully & artistically designed & detailed. It was also extremely clean! Staying here was an experience in itself. Keep in mind the ""no shoes in the apartment"" rule is a strict one; all shoes are kept outside. Cynthia walks around barefoot, & I was comfortable doing the same, but if you aren't, make sure to bring socks or slippers. I found the loft very comfortable after my days of wandering around. There is an air conditioner up there that you have control over, which was very nice. The room was small but cozy, & the only thing worth mentioning is that the walls of the room & loft do not go all the way up to the ceiling so you will hear everything in the apartment. Also, the door to the room is see-through, so you do not have 100% privacy. Changing in the little dressing room was a bit tough for me at 5'4"" tall; consider changing in the bathroom if you are taller. The rest of the apartment is perfect. The area is wonderful. A pharmacy & Starbucks & a subway station within a block walk; Central Park steps away with the Reservoir greeting you when you enter. Museum Mile is close as well. Getting down to Brooklyn Bridge took about 20 minutes on the express lines & another 5 down to Bowling Green & Battery Park. Not too difficult to get to Times Square either. Overall, fantastic location. Lots of cute shops & places to eat. Very non-touristy feeling. I will be contacting Cynthia again if I ever need a place to stay in NYC. 5 star rating from me; fantastic stay. Would highly recommend....[QWERTY123]From the moment i walked into the apartment i knew this was a different kind of airbnb experience. The interior decoration is beautiful and each room looks great in its own unique way, with chandeliers, mosaics and chic modern art all around.

Cynthia is a generous and kind person who went out of her way to make my five days in New York as fun and easy as it could possibly be. There are lots of grocery stores, restaurants, and things to do in the area, and walking around was pretty safe at night. Central Park is a five minute walk, the subway is 90 seconds away, and there's also the metro museum of art about a 15 minute walk away. All really convenient, but if you'll be spending most of your time downtown then lower Manhattan is very easy to get to in about 20-25 minutes on the subway, and Times Square is about the same with one train transfer on the way.

Cynthia was extremely considerate and always thinking ahead - she really is a wonderful host in what many might see as an intimidating city. New York is a great city full of predominantly great people, and Cynthia really made it feel that way as soon as i got there - after the first night i was more than comfortable and really enjoyed myself, when maybe i would have been a bit tentative going out at night by myself, it was great. I absolutely loved my stay and will be trying to make sure that all my friends stay with Cynthia when visiting this great city in the future.[QWERTY123]The best place to stay in NYC! Cynthia is a wonderful person, and her house is very clean and beautiful. It was my first experience using Airbnb and  I absolutely loved it!  I slept wonderfully in the Frette sheets and her towels are great too, as everything else in the apt. Great neighbourhood, I will definitely stay again![QWERTY123]Five stars!  I'm a first time Airbnb user and wasn't certain what to expect; I'm so glad I picked Cynthia's location.  The room was exactly as pictured and promised.  This apartment is a dream, very well-loved and cared for, and the location is fantastic.  Cynthia provided me with fantastic restaurant suggestions, directions, shopping destinations- I felt immediately at home.  This will be my new UES location of choice.
[QWERTY123]Cynthia is a wonderful host! Friendly, helpful, did everything she could to make my stay comfortable, easy, and memorable. Her home is beautiful, albeit eccentric, and tip-top clean. The shower is great, I felt at home in the kitchen making tea and helping myself to cereal, the bed was very comfortable and linens exquisite and it's quiet quiet quiet at night. Location is great too -- an easy subway ride downtown, walkable to Guggenheim and Met, good restaurants in the hood, I felt fine walking home late at night too. I recommend it and would stay again.[QWERTY123]I had an amazing time  at Cynthia's place in Manhattan. 

Cynthia is an honest person and full of energy, willing to have interesting conversations about any subject you or she pops up. She helped me getting to her place from the AirPort and responds to email on à Really short notice.

When I arrived she showed me around in the neighbourhood, gave me a metrocard and explained me how to get on the train. The place is very close to all of the major things to see in NY.

Her place is totally clean and is flourishing with her own art., if thats your thing you would be amazed. Otherwise, it's stil very Nice and interesting to see.

In other words, Cynthia is an amazing person to spend your time in NY with, the place has à very good location is totally clean, and the city ofcourse is wonderful. This is an outstanding place to stay, I would recommend it to anyone.

[QWERTY123]What an amazing host. Caring and looking after your every need. I cannot recommend Cynthia or this listing highly enough.[QWERTY123]I had a great time staying at Cynthia's place! She was such a great host! She was helpful, friendly, and made my trip in New York so memorable :) And the house is beautiful, clean, and extremely cozy. I'll definitely go back! :D[QWERTY123]That's what I call home in NY. Did I already say it? =)[QWERTY123]A great location to stay and lovely host.  Particularly liked the Mexican restaurant (Cynthia's local). I went back the following night on my way back for a busy day out![QWERTY123]Cynthia is a wonderful person and a great host. The location is ideal. Her place is clean, comfortable, and an artistic experience. I definitely plan to return![QWERTY123]I had a great stay with Cynthia. She is smart, helpful and very quick to respond to queries. She makes a delicious breakfast that kept me energised during a pretty exhausting week. The apartment is beautiful and scrupulously clean. The room is small but perfect and the bed is up some steps and really comfortable (but not advisable if you have mobility problems). 
Good location, close to restaurants and subway. I felt fine coming back to the apartment at night by myself. All in all, a brilliant experience.[QWERTY123]Cynthia was the nicest host I could expect, and she made me to feel at home. The house is really stylish and was a warm place to rest inside that very cold city. If I go back to NYC, I will know where to stay.
Thanks a lot Cynthia![QWERTY123]Cynthia is a generous and engaging hostess and her home is itself a work of art. She like having people around.[QWERTY123]Clean affordable place, very comfortable bed for me, convenient 1-block to Lex train to mid-town, good neighborhood, 24-hour produce store on corner, quiet space to work in living room with wi-fi, good capable host with good quiet work can be done in apartment, but the fun conversation is there if you want it.  Thumbs up.[QWERTY123]I feel so lucky having this opportunity to stay in Cynthia's home, which makes my NY trip a perfect experience! Thank you Cynthia![QWERTY123]Staying at Cynthia's place was just great and would recommend it anyone who's interested! She's very sweet and the place is just awesome :)[QWERTY123]Being a first time Airbnb user, I had a hard time trying to sort out where to stay in such a big city...however, this apartment was a true adventure and haven at the same time. A great find! 

Opulently decorated with art work by the owner/host, it is well presented, clean and comfortable. Even though the rooms are snug, it is more than enough for the single intrepid traveller. 

Breakfast is a healthy mix of granola, hemp and chia seeds, raw chocolate a dash of agave oil and a generous dollop of natural yoghurt. A great starter for the busy day of sightseeing or shopping aead. 

Close to the subway direct to downtown and a short stroll to Central Park, it also has many facilities in the area including a 24hour convenience store/pharmacy, some great eateries and drinking holes. 

Best of all, the host, Cynthia, is a warm and most approachable person. She is helpful, has great tips for exploring the city and loves a chat. 

I would recommend this apartment to any one who wants to explore and experience New York like a local. 
[QWERTY123]Le séjour chez Cynthia a été vraiment très agréable, la situation de l'appartement est idéale, près de Central Park et du métro, et le décor de l'appartement est magnifique, digne d'un palais vénitien !!! Cynthia et une hôte très accueillante, prête à donner des informations, nous aider dans nos recherches, nous donner des conseils. On se sent vraiment chez soi.[QWERTY123]Just returned from a stimulating few days chez Cynthia. The apartment is warm, comfortable and beautifully furnished and decorated (check out the chandeliers...).  She is great company, interesting but also interested in you. And helpful, whether recommending great bookstores, alerting you to art exhibitions or printing out your boarding pass for you. I enjoyed my stay immensely and hope to be back soon.[QWERTY123]L'appartement de Cynthia est idéalement situé, à deux pas de Central Park dans un chouette quartier. De là, il est facile de joindre tous les sites remarquables de Manhattan. Cynthia, artiste engagée au grand coeur, donne beaucoup de son temps et de ses connaissances à ses hôtes. Qu'elle bichonne lors de leur séjour.
Une vraie rencontre et des découvertes.[QWERTY123]lovely as usual[QWERTY123]Cynthia was a great host. Very flexible, courteous and available. Her place is a beautiful experience and the location can't be beat: diverse area, a block away from the subway and a short jog to central park. Would recommend.[QWERTY123]Staying with Cynthia was a great experience! She's a caring host.who wants nothing but total comfort for her guests. She makes great beverages for breakfast, has amazing feather-soft bath towels, amazingly comfortable bed, air conditioning (you'll need it in NYC in the summertime) and fast wifi. The location is very good and the neighbourhood is safe. Besides physical comfort you also get a great interesting person to chat with, she will tell you anything you need to know about the city and more. It was my first time with Airbnb and I am so happy: I found this intelligent and smart woman and I'll definitely stay at this place again.[QWERTY123]I loved staying with Cynthia. She is very nice and accommodating. The place is beautiful and a great location in the middle of Manhattan. Breakfast was delicious and made a great start to a fabulous day in New York City. A great safe neighborhood to stay in if you are a lone traveler wanting to explore this amazing city. The room is quite small but very dark and quiet so it is great for sleeping and getting over jet lag.[QWERTY123]When looking for accommodation I insist that three conditions are always met, cleanliness, easy access to public transport and lots of positive reviews, and this property delivered on all three and more besides. Cynthia replies promptly with booking requests and general queries about her place and when I arrived she showed me round her immediate neighbourhood and helped me with purchasing my MetroCard. She takes her responsibility as a host seriously and that can only be a good thing for any future guests. 

This was my first  Airbnb booking.[QWERTY123]Cynthia est une personne chaleureuse qui sait recevoir les voyageurs. Sa sensibilité artistique donne à sa demeure un coté atypique et très personnel. Ça restera une belle rencontre.
a bientôt Cynthia. 
[QWERTY123]Cynthia was very friendly and nice. The room I stayed was small and cozy.The apartment was beautiful and comfortable. I think the location was perfect and close to central park and subways. She made sure to make me comfortable and apartment was  clean and maintained really well. I could use the kitchen and had choices of breakfast which makes you feel like being at your home :). I look forward to staying her  again too.[QWERTY123]Cynthia's apartment is beautifully unique, you need only take the detail of her images & description as a guide of a thoughtful host. The furnishings and decoration are such a pleasure, comfortable and full of creative energy. A perfect location for art lovers, little more than 10 blocks from the Guggenheim, and with the Whitney & MET just beyond, along with Central Park's Conservatory Water. All central sights are walking distance, and key subway lines are just 1 block away if you prefer. Such good conversation from a like creative mind, someone who made me feel considered, thoughtfully accommodated and made me feel safe as a lone traveller, even inviting me to dinner. No small detail was not thought of. An excellent apartment, great recommendations and someone who added even more flair to a wonderful trip.[QWERTY123]This was my first airbnb and it was a great experience at Cynthia's. The atmosphere of the apartment and her charming personality added greatly to my NY experience. In short: prompt and great communication, a clean, relaxing and comfortable apartment with the facilities in perfect working condition. A helpful and friendly hostess who takes care of her airbnb in a professional way. Access to main subway line is just around the corner. I would definitely book it again if i am staying in NY.[QWERTY123]Cynthia was a great host who really helped me to feel comfortable at home and finding my way into the New York jungle. The room was tiny but had everything I needed. Most important, it was completely quiet - something to appreciate when staying in a big city! The apartment is just beautiful with all decorations and details, and it is close to Central Park, the subway and museums.[QWERTY123]Great location, one block from metro stop and 3 blocks from Central Park which. Was important for me as I needed to continue some training. Cynthia's created a unique and warm home and she has fantastic energy, I don't know how she does it. Great suggestions on local places to shop and available for advice at any time. Hope to visit again and would recommend to anyone.[QWERTY123]I had a wonderful NY experience with Cynthia K. For a start, she was very responsive, and communication was easy and efficient. Before I arrived she provided many suggestions and tips of how to get there and things I could do and see.
When I arrived her welcome was warm and made me feel at home immediately. Cynthia was a great host - she was there when I needed her but I had privacy otherwise. In addition, she helped with all those little things one may need - an umbrella on a rainy day, a laminated subway map, etc.

The house is a real gem - everywhere you look there is another thing to explore. And everything is spotless and well maintained.
It is under 1 minute walk to the nearest subway, very close to central park, and within an easy walk from some of the most famous museums.

I had a great time and certainly hope to stay there again.[QWERTY123]Cynthia is a fantastic host. She made me feel welcome from the very first moment I entered her apartment. She cares for the well-being of her guests, is very helpful with practical information (transportation in NYC, good places to eat etc.) and she is always open for a chat. 
The room is small but clean and very quiet and you are free to use the living room and kitchen. The apartment itself is worth a visit! Every room is furnished and decorated with an artistic touch that is a feast for the eye. The atmosphere is nice and comfortable. 
Situated on a quiet street on the upper east side, the apartment is in walking distance from Central Park and very close to a subway station with a direct line to downtown Manhattan (approx. 15 min.). It is thus easy to get to and from the place and the area feels secure, also at night.
I can warmly recommend a stay at Cynthia's![QWERTY123]Cynthia provides so much more than a bed to sleep in (which was extremely comfortable by the way). The apartment is also her studio so expect to see art in the making and witness her passion and excitement about her work. It is also her home, so there are a few rules (alas I managed to forget most of them at least once - *sorry* Cynthia). Highly recommended.[QWERTY123]The location was great[QWERTY123]A Home Away from Home. The property is incredibly well located on the Upper East Side. 40min from JFK. 10min from Hyde Park. 15min from the Guggenheim. Great pizzas & burger joint nearby. 

The flat is incredible. Totally art deco. The rooms are small but very well furnished. The bedding is soft & the shower warm. 

Most importantly, Cynthia was a terrific host, welcoming, caring & attentive. 

I will be back.[QWERTY123]Cynthia was really friendly and helpful. The place was really cool. My bedroom was very small but wasn't claustrophobic at all! The rest of the house looked really awesome too. And it was all very clean and well taken care of. The area was very calm. It was very convenient that there was a subway station very nearby.
So all in all, it was a very good experience[QWERTY123]Lovely apartment, impeccably kept. Close to Central Park. Safe neighborhood. Cynthia is a very warm, friendly and inclusive host - I had a much more enjoyable trip as a result of staying with her than I would have in a hotel.[QWERTY123]Cynthia's place is just a beautiful as she describes.

And her house is ideally located, very close to the subway and near Central Park... great for going for a run! I much enjoyed my stay, and I will not forget the very good times shared with Cynthia and other guest during breakfast. It was a dream to go to New York, and it was wonderful to meet Cynthia. Thank you for all yours attentions. I will be back.[QWERTY123]I stayed with Cynthia for two weeks during Christmas and New Years and definitely my trip couldn't be better. She is a really nice and interesting person who is up to help you to have a great experience around NYC. We spent a nice time together, her place is LOVELY!!! The Oak Room is a nice space, with a comfortable bed, space to your things and be sure you gonna have a good rest there. Like the description, the apartment is really close from the line 6 of the Metro Station, something that makes easy go and come from wherever you want. The neighborhood is really safe (walked around late at night few times and totally safe)

As well as being only one street away from the underground station, which was very nice after walking around manhattan all day. Cynthia was a very nice host and helpful.[QWERTY123]Sono stato 5 notti in questo meraviglioso appartamento. Cynthia si è rivelata un'ottima host, sempre gentile e premurosa.

So there is absolutley nothing bad to say! 
Highly!!!!!! recommended! :)[QWERTY123]My week-long stay was simply fantastic.  The apartment and facilities were exactly as described.  Really well located for easy access to the subway (96th) and a short ride from the centre of the city.  I also appreciated the relative peace which you don't get if you're staying in the centre in a hotel which meant I slept really, really well there.  My stay offered me the opportunity to feel like I genuinely lived in NYC; which is exactly what I was looking for.  Staying there was a luxurious, quirky &  thoroughly enjoyable experience.  Being so close to Central Park was a real bonus.  The plethora of high quality coffee shops, bars, restaurants and shops within 5 minutes walk was brilliant.  Cynthia was totally amazing; an absolute gem!  She was welcoming, super helpful, fun, creative interesting and intelligent; what a fabulous combo!  Just brilliant to be around.  Her beautiful homes reflects her and is handcrafted with love.  Without a doubt I will definitely be back to stay there again - I like to think of Cynthia's beautiful apartment as my Carrie Bradshaw getaway in the gorgeous NYC.  I loved every minute of it!  Don't hesitate - book it now!  What are you waiting for?![QWERTY123]Great room, excellent location, and Cynthia was a fantastic host who have me lots of tips!! Highly recommend!!![QWERTY123]Had a great stay - the entire flat is beautifully decorated and very well looked after, and Cynthia is a very welcoming host with lots of ideas for things to do in the city. The location is great as well, being just a block away from the subway. Recommended![QWERTY123]For my first time in New-York, I had a really great time. Cynthia is really kind and she helped me to have the best journey. I felt like at home in her beautiful apartment which is really quiet and peaceful. From her place, it's really easy to go Downtown and Central Park is really close. I hope I will stay there once again and spend time to talk with Cynthia about art and life.[QWERTY123]Cynthia was a great host, who was happy to answer questions, give tips, and share stories. I enjoyed my stay at her house a lot!

The room is indeed very small, the bed is great though. The house is beautifully decorated. The area has some nice restaurants, and is walking distance from Central Park and the Museum Mile. 

All in all, I can warmly recommend this place.[QWERTY123]Everything were great. Nice apartment, best location. Cynthia was kind and helpful. Excellent experience[QWERTY123]To sum up my visit in one word, amazing! The apartment was just lovely, the room was quiet and welcomed a restful sleep after a long flight.  Cynthia was warm and welcoming right from the get go.  In short, I loved my stay here![QWERTY123]写真のｲﾒｰｼﾞどおりの素晴らしいお部屋でした｡
ﾍﾞｯﾄﾞﾙｰﾑ､ﾘﾋﾞﾝｸﾞ､ｷｯﾁﾝ､ﾊﾞｽﾙｰﾑ､すべての室内の内装が美しく､清潔に保たれていました｡静かな住宅街にあるので､夜はぐっすり安眠できます｡お部屋は写真で見た感じ､少し狭いのかと予想していましたが､全然問題ありませんでした｡ﾘﾋﾞﾝｸﾞが広々としているので､こちらでくつろぐこともできると思います｡
一番心配していたのは治安でしたが､地下鉄の最寄駅から近く､24時間空いているｽｰﾊﾟｰ(日本のｺﾝﾋﾞﾆのような感じ)もいくつかあり､夜中でも人通りはわりと多いので､安心して帰宅することが出来ました｡生活に必要なものは大抵最寄駅周辺で入手できます｡
私は､毎日朝早くから観光に出かけて､夜遅く帰っていたので､家でくつろいだり､ﾎｽﾄと会話を楽しむことができませんでしたが､わずかな交流の間でも､旅に役立つｱﾄﾞﾊﾞｲｽをたくさんくれました｡帰りの飛行機が早朝便で､朝6時前に起こしてしまったのにもかかわらず､ﾀｸｼｰの手配や荷物運びを手伝ってくれたり､最後まで面倒見がよく､とても優しかったです｡
気持ちのよいおもてなしと美しいお部屋に癒されて､最高のﾆｭｰﾖｰｸ一人旅が出来ました｡[QWERTY123]Super as always[QWERTY123]5日間泊まらせていただいて､素晴らしい経験ができました!
ﾍﾞｯﾄﾞﾙｰﾑやｷｯﾁﾝ､ﾘﾋﾞﾝｸﾞ､ﾊﾞｽﾙｰﾑは隅々まで手入れが行き届いてていて､空調や収納など､使う人の目線に立った設備が整っていました｡
Cynthiaさんの統一感のある部屋の環境づくりには､ただただ脱帽です｡ぜひ一度泊まることをお勧めします｡

ﾆｭｰﾖｰｸを旅する際には､さまざまなｱﾄﾞﾊﾞｲｽを下さるので､それもすごく助けとなりました｡

Her apartment fascinate me. It has an exquisite taste in decor and admired both for her achievements at home and by the great person she is. Greetings and i hope we are in touch for the next.

Best. Isis[QWERTY123]Staying at Cynthia's was a special event.  First, her place is exquisitely decoarated with an eclectic touch that only an artist like her could provide.  Coming home each night to her warm abode was like returning to a familiar surrounding you knew all of your life.  But most importantly, was Cynthia herself.  She not only made me feel very much at home but offered such an engaging conversation I look very forward to staying with her over and over again. I definitely found a wonderful new friend to talk and laugh with on my often otherwise weary travels about.

Five stars!  Highly recommend![QWERTY123]Good location,amazing decoration,warm care!All about Sweetie Cynthiais is a pretty good host. 5 days stay with a artist is a good experience.The room which I stayed is clean and warm,every morning she made apple&banana smoothie for me and we sit together and talk about our life.If u come to NYC,you cannot miss her place which felt like stay at home.[QWERTY123]Nice room, nice owner. The apartment is very near to the subway.[QWERTY123]I had a wonderful stay at Cynthia's apartment. Cynthia was a great host and her apartment was absolutely incredible and very clean.  The apartment is located on the UES and around the corner of the apartment there is a subway station. I would definitley stay here again the next time I'm in NYC.[QWERTY123]Cynthia's home was beautiful and made the trip to NYC quite special. The apartment is clean and creatively designed (and redesigned). It's in a great location, being one block away from the subway, and only a casual stroll away from Central Park.

Cynthia is an inspiring person and full of energy. She taught me a lot during our Life Conversations. She made me delicious smoothies every morning and gave genuine hospitality. More than anything, I'm grateful that I've made a new friend.[QWERTY123]Cynthia was an amazing host who made my stay most comfortable and homely. A truly beautiful NY experience in her home. It is a great location with everything within reach. I would definitely recommend Cynthia as a host and would happily stay again. A++[QWERTY123]Cynthia is: 
HONEST
KIND
HIGHLY INTELLIGENT
CARING
CLEAN
ORGANIZED
HELPFUL
[QWERTY123]Cynthia is very warm welcoming and treat her gast with heart, her apartment is an art piece, if you come to New York for visiting museum and looking for art inspiration, then you should live here, if you are looking for good advices for New York City, here is your choice. if you love clean environment and well metro connection, just book here 

and breakfast smoothie from Cynthia is awesome! 

will definitely visit again if i ever come back[QWERTY123]Cynthia非常有熱情,無論是對客人還是生活:) 地點也非常好,兩分鐘內到地鐵站,周遭生活機能也十分方便｡最重要的是家裡的裝潢汗氣氛都很棒很有巧思,是在飯店裡找不到的｡房間有點小但是住的很舒適｡[QWERTY123]It was my first Airbnb experience, and I'm glad I chose Cynthia's! She kept her apartment very clean and well-organized, and made sure I was comfortable with everything. I'm definitely going to miss chatting and cooking with her -- and having her delicious smoothies as breakfast!

I was having an exhibition in New York, and Cynthia helped me spread the news around and she even brought friends to attend the opening. Cynthia was not only a great host but also a great friend![QWERTY123]My stay at Cynthia's was exactly what I imagined in terms of location and space. I was more than elated by my hostess'  kind guidance, neatness and profound concern with making every second count! Cynthia pays great attention to details where and when they matter.[QWERTY123]This is one of the most beautiful, unique apartments I've ever had the pleasure of seeing. Cynthia is an artist who has spent decades making her space into a haven of mosaic walls, rustic doors, and antique chandeliers. It's a lovely surprise tucked into an otherwise straightforward, unadorned building. 

The room itself is small, but high ceilings and well-placed mirrors make it seem more spaciousness. As a place to sleep, the room reminded me of an old-fashioned sleeper berth on a very fancy train; it was dark, calm, and quiet. 

Cynthia is a wonderful and generous host who makes tea, breakfast smoothies, and even fresh, warm soy milk; she also knows the best places in the neighborhood to get ramen, pizza, and cheese—all very important. Staying with her was a very special unique experience, and I can see why her room is so consistently booked! Would definitely stay here again and recommend to others.

Cynthia was a more-than-gracious host[QWERTY123]Cynthia is a lovely host and her place is a real pearl of the Upper East Side. Apt is under 1min walk from subway station that connects you to downtown. I had really good tips for my trip from her. Not to mention morning smooties, tea and nice conversations.

Thanks C and my highest recommendations to all who are looking for a place to stay in NYC.

--juha[QWERTY123]This host made me feel like I really need to work on my host game. Cynthia is amazing, kind and thoughful. She booked a car for me, she checked in on me on the day and offered an invitation to get ramen. She was sweet and welcoming on everyday that I was there. 

Ok. Her home: Is a well curated museum. It beautiful, the art is surprising in it's beauty. The dragon fly thorax alone is worth the stay here, even if nothing were true. 

This place is a treasue.[QWERTY123]Cynthia was a terrific host! The room and beautiful apartment were exactly as advertised. Proximity to trains was a 2 min walk. I had a terrific time and would definitely stay again - thanks Cynthia![QWERTY123]Cynthia is a perfect host. She is very welcoming and accomodating. She is nice and lovely person. She was always available and helpful.
Her house is kind of museum. Neat cozy very clean and comfortable...[QWERTY123]Do you have to give extra ""stars"" when your host quite literally saves your life?  What the heck, she gets them.   Going above and beyond what one expects of a host, Cynthia helped me carry my (VERY heavy) duffle bag to the cab, and as a bonus, she yanked me out of the path of a bus I was distracted enough to almost walk in front of.

I very much enjoyed my stay at Cynthia's place--the pictures don't begin to do it justice.  Works of art and lovely, quirky little touches are everywhere.  She made her crust-less apple ""pie"" (which was delicious!) as a welcome, and kindly left a light on at night to make it easier to navigate to the bathroom.  One evening when I got home early we sat on the front stoop talking for an hour--she's a very interesting person.

The bedroom is TINY, and the bed is small but very comfortable--I slept great for the five nights I was there.  Everything was very clean and well-maintained.  

I highly recommend this lovely spot with its welcoming host--it is right down the street from the subway, as well as a Starbucks, a drugstore, and some very cool little restaurants.[QWERTY123]Cynthia is an exceptional host! Very welcoming, supportive and funny. The place is perfectly clean, beautifully designed and very inspiring. I would definitely recommend it, location is very close to the central park and metro.Had a pleasure to stay there![QWERTY123]It was a great experience to stay with Cynthia and in her home. She is a warm person, great host and cares about making my stay happy and comfortable. Whenever she was home when I went home, she welcomed me and made me happy to be home. 

Her place is like an art museum and unique and cozy. Location is close to subway no.6 so that means you can get to grand central station easily.

Great place to recover from jet lag since the room has thick curtains to make it completely dark without light from outside and comfortable bed mattress.[QWERTY123]Cynthia was great host ever! She's so cheerful and outgoing!
She provided everything what she mention on the website even more.
We had a dinner together and chatted a lot! Very enjoyed to stay there. Highly recommend![QWERTY123]If you want a true NYC experience, stay here! Cynthia is not only an amazing host, but an extremely talented artist as well. She was incredibly hospitable in every sense of the word. This will come to be your home away from home. The apartment is the coolest.... artfully and tastefully decorated and well maintained. I loved it. The bedroom is small, but (Website hidden by Airbnb) cocoons you in comfort. You will get the best nights of sleep and rest, which is needed for your days of fun. It is perfectly located in the upper east end and 4 blocks from Central Park. The metro to downtown in right around the block. Your restaurant selection is vast. I cannot say enough good things about my stay here and how much I enjoyed myself!! Cynthia is the loveliest of hosts and a wealth of NYC knowledge!![QWERTY123]some rules can makes living and staying little uncomfortable 'for someone'

But still
She is quite nice host and
her house is clean and have special atmosphere[QWERTY123]This's My first time to U.S. and travelled alone. I'm glad that I chose Cynthia's place which was definitely  elegance and museum atmosphere as many reviews, and it also made me feel relax and safety. I slept well from first night and went to toilet every morning on time and productive.Sometimes traveling can cause stressful,but Cynthia and her apt helped me end up with a wonderful trip and memories.
Thank you,Cynthia! Every part of your amazing house art works, and the movement I spent there will be unforgettable for me.[QWERTY123]I arrived early in the morning and the host allowed me to arrive early; that was considerate.[QWERTY123]Cynthia is a very nice host and I enjoyed the stay very much. Can highly recommend it![QWERTY123]Fabulous accommodation in Manhattan - quiet, comfortable and always with a very warm welcome![QWERTY123]My stay at Cynthia's apartment could not have been more pleasant. The apartment is beautiful, in the best possible location, and Cynthia could not have been more kind and gracious.  I can't  recommend this Airbnb highly enough![QWERTY123]Cinthya Department is a true work of art, built with patience, dedication and love, hardly you will find a most original place to stay in Manhattan  than this Department, she is also a good hostess.[QWERTY123]Sehr führsorglich und Gastfreundlich[QWERTY123]Cosy single room in an immaculately clean and warm home just around the corner from the subway, few blocks from Central Park and museum mile. 

Cynthia is a warm and friendly host who is always up for a chat about anything and everything.

Fab stay![QWERTY123]Perfect place to stay in New York! Subway, shops, restaurants and high park right around the corner, a quiet and cozy room, and a great location. The best thing about the  apartment is Cynthia though, what a great host!!! I felt right at home from the first moment and had many interesting and inspiring conversations with her. It was like staying with a friend! Also, the apartment is stunning, a total piece of art, meticulously decorated in the most unique way. I highly  recommend staying with Cynthia. You will not be disappointed!![QWERTY123]Spent a few days while on vacation in NYC and had a great time. Great location with easy access to subway system, walking distance to several restaurants/museums, and Cynthia was a great host. Would definitely recommend staying here for your stay in the city.[QWERTY123]Cynthia's is the perfect place to stay in New York. She made me feel so comfortable and at home, it was as if I'd known her my whole life. While I was stressed with work during my trip, Cynthia made my trip to New York so fun and memorable. Her apartment is very comfortable, with a great location near the subway. I can't wait to stay with her again next time I come to the city and I can't say enough great things![QWERTY123]Very good experience, thank Sny provides a sweet and comfortable space, although the room is small, but very warm.[QWERTY123]It was great stay at Cyn's place. She was friendly and very easy to communicate with. The location is great, very close to public transport, museums and Central Park.[QWERTY123]Every time I get back to Cynthia's, I get amazed by the positive energy the place has and love the diving experience into Cynthia's art.[QWERTY123]The location is great. The two subways will take you almost everywhere downtown.
The area is relatively quiet and safe at night.
Cyn is so warmhearted and caring that you'll feel like visiting your relatives.[QWERTY123]The room is really clean, and the location is great. It's convenient to go to the metropolitan museum and central park. The host is the best host I have ever met. She is really nice, kind, and friendly.[QWERTY123]Cynthia is a super nice host, she is so nice, easy to communicate and show me the around city. Her house is near the train station and Central Park. Thanks for your smoothie every morning![QWERTY123]The wife asked me to post this as is:  Cyn's place is like an artist's haven. The room is small (it's NYC), but everything you'll need is there. It's also beautifully whimsical. The neighborhood is quiet, close to the subway and the 24 hour pharmacy. As for Cyn herself, she was warm and welcoming... always reachable by phone or email to answer any questions, and even before I checked in, she got in touch with my hubby to make sure we had a clear idea of how to get there. Would definitely recommend her place, and am looking forward to staying there again.[QWERTY123]Cyn fue un host maravilloso. De los mejores que he estado (sino el mejor) el lugar es limpio bien ubicado. La habitación no es muy grande pero está bien, contrasta con el corazón de Cyn y lo Buen anfitriona que ella es. Siempre ofreciendo cosas, ayudando, y preparando un smoothie todas las mañanas. Es muy atenta y considerada. La recomiendo 120%!!!![QWERTY123]I'm so thankful for AirBnB because it's only by this service, a stroke of luck, and planets aligning that I was able to meet someone as interesting and unique as Cynthia and stay at her fittingly unique and interesting place. I think the major value of AirBnB is not just finding a place to stay, but being able to see life through a different lense, that of the host. 

That said, the place is something else and I don't think I'd do it justice by trying to describe it. Do yourself a favor and stay a few nights there. The location is great as the museums and the park are right there. The 6 train is right around the corner and it'll take all the way down to the lower parts of Manhattan fairly quickly[QWERTY123]Limpeza, localização, hospitalidade excelentes[QWERTY123]I had a most amazing time at Cynthia's place. She is one of the best person I've ever met. You'll like every part of her place since it's beautiful, unique and clean! And the room is perfect for recovering from your jet lag. And she can make the best smoothie for you(a real good one)! Cynthia is not just a host but a real friend for sure! Can't wait to meet her again ![QWERTY123]Très bon logement à Manhattan, joliment décoré, bien situé et à deux pas du métro. Cynthia est d'une grande gentillesse et toujours disponible pour aider et donner de bons conseils.     Je n'hésiterai pas à y retourner à mon prochain séjour à NY. 
Je recommande fortement.[QWERTY123]She is an amazing host and artist! She got unique taste for her apartment! The apartment is located very close to train station to downtown ! I appreciate her taking care of me and showed me around for the first day ! It was wonderful Airbnb experience! Highly recommended![QWERTY123]Cyn is an awesome host, very welcoming and lots of fun. Her apartment, while small, is charming and full of her original art and interesting ornaments. 
On arrival, Cyn took me for a walk around Central Park (only 5 minutes away) and was full of great local advice. I highly recommend staying with Cyn.[QWERTY123]Lovely place, terrific host, great smoothie
Thank you so much, cyn! It was a wonderful stay![QWERTY123]Cyn was an awesome host! You'll love the unique vibe you get from her place and the great smoothies you'll get to start your day with, thanks again![QWERTY123]Cyn's house is really beautiful! Her craft is embodied in every corner of the house. The location can not be more perfect (just a 5 min walk from Central Park and 2 min from the 4, 5, 6 and Q subway lines). Everything is very comfortable and Cyn is in every detail. I loved living a week at her home ... and I will surely come back... hopefully soon ;)[QWERTY123]Thanks to Cynthia's apartment, every day the breakfast,enthusiastic help. Let me in New York had the most wonderful holiday.If you go to New York, here is the best choice[QWERTY123]Cyn's apartment was so comfortable, and she was so welcoming. I had the use of the whole space even though she was also there. She was helpful, but not intrusive, recommending restaurants in the area, and there were many small, inexpensive, but excellent places, and also travel tips to different parts of the city. I found the neighborhood very convenient to all the places I needed to go and felt quite safe no matter what time of day I was out and about. Having Central Park right at my fingertips was also a plus for an early evening stroll. I highly recommend this AirBnB for your next trip to NYC.[QWERTY123]The apartment was beautiful and clean. Cyn was extremely considerate and welcoming. The breakfast smoothie was a nice surprise. Conviently located next to the 6 train and department stores.  I would definitely stay there again.[QWERTY123]L'appartement (encore plus beau en vrai!) est très bien situé métro tout proche et central parc à 5 minutes à pied. Et l'hôte, Cynthia est ADORABLE : très réactive aux messages, attentive aux détails et à l'écoute de son hôte, de superbes discussions, bonne conseillère sur les bonnes adresses et endroits à visiter, un smoothie wouaouh tous les matins. Avoir une hôte comme Cynthia rend le séjour encore plus parfait![QWERTY123]Tolles Apartment mit schicker, liebevoller, wenn auch leicht toskanisch-viktorianischer Einrichtung. Bett himmlisch. Lage hervorragend. Gastgeberin ungeheuer nett und hilfsbereit. Wer allerdings viel sitzen möchte, hat schlechte Karten, da es keine Stühle gibt.[QWERTY123]I stayed at Cyn's place for 5 days, but thanks to her great hospitality, I felt as if I've already lived many years there. Everything in her place is aesthetic until the tiniest details, I felt like living in the museum. The location is perfect, too, it is very well connected with public transportations, you can go everywhere easily. She also gave me a great introduction to the NY city. Cyn is an energetic, super cool and open-hearted person - one of the most amazing persons I've ever met! Sincere thanks again for all lovely time during my NY stay, and hope to see you soon again![QWERTY123]I had a fantastic trip in New-York and Cyn's place was great !
The location is very good (next to the metro '6', some good restaurants in the neighborhood...) and Cyn is friendly, everything good ^^[QWERTY123]The bed was very comfortable 
The room was an adequate size for one person
The bathroom was clean 
Privacy was good
Public transport was close by[QWERTY123]So much to love about this place! It's arty and interesting and comfortable and clean. It's also in a great neighbourhood. Right away from all the touristy hoo-har of mid-town and downtown, but easily accessible on two subway lines - the 6 and the Q. If you're staying for over a week like I did, Cyn will provide you with a metro card. All you have to do is load it up for $32 and you go anywhere and everywhere you want. But the best thing about this place is Cyn herself. I started most of my mornings with a healthy smoothie and oodles of interesting chit-chat. NYC is an awesome place anyway, but staying here made it even more awesome![QWERTY123]I had a wonderful stay! The apartment is beautifully furnished and decorated and the neighborhood has great shops and restaurants and so close to Central Park! And course the subway. Cynthia is a fantastic host and her smoothies are amazing! Would thoroughly recommend staying here[QWERTY123]Un séjour douillet, dans un décor féérique et une hôte souriante, joyeuse et pleine de bons plans. Une artiste au coeur grand  ❣[QWERTY123]Cyn Is a photographer and artist.   Her home has been an ongoing art project for about 20 years.  It is beautiful, comfortable, and every detail has been thought through. Committed to her guests’ comfort, she happily oriented me to the neighborhood and gave me ideas for what to see in Manhattan.  I had a great time —and a much better time than had I stayed In a hotel. Thank you so much, Cyn![QWERTY123]Un bon spot au calme proche du métro.[QWERTY123]Cyn's place is amazing.  She is friendly, courteous, helpful and a great hostess with the mostess![QWERTY123]Absolutely terrific. Excellent communication leading up to my arrival, including quick and helpful responses. Flat itself is spotlessly clean and beautifully furnished, with real care evident throughout. Cyn was a perfect host - incredibly generous and willing to share local's tips for New York. Great location, too - just a minute's walk from the subway, so east to get anywhere. Plus lots of the main museums and galleries are within walking distance from the flat anyway! Would highly recommend.[QWERTY123]I love Cyn’s magic house ,which makes me feel warm and cozy. She always tell me the best tips and gives me the nice caring. The location is also good that can let u go anywhere u want to go within the least time. 
If u want to experience the local American life,I really recommend that. Thanks Cyn![QWERTY123]O apartamento é muito estiloso e bem localizado, a 1 quadra e meia do metrô, 1 quadra de Starbucks, farmácia... então facilmente você pode ir onde quiser. Na chegada há escadas, mas ela te ajuda com a mala. Fui no extremo inverno e o chuveiro é bem quentinho. A cama, o edredom e o travesseiro são maravilhosamente confortáveis, e o quarto é 100% silencioso então você pode dormir até a hora que quiser. O  quarto é bem pequeno, então se você tiver com muitas malas pode ser complicado. Cyn é uma excelente pessoa e te deixa muito a vontade, como se fosse sua própria casa. Ela deixa você tomar 2 banhos no dia (e até gosta que você tome), é muito limpa e organizada. Te trata calorosamente e amigavel, e mesmo se você não dominar o inglês, ela tem toda a paciência do mundo e te ensina quantas vezes for necessario como funciona as coisas da casa te mostrando na prática, não com bilhetinhos, o que torna mais agradável. E sempre dará um jeito de ajudar você quando você estiver em apuros. Ela me ajudou muito, não sei o que seria de mim sem ela. Pediu até para uma amiga dela intermediar a conversa em português comigo e me deu muitas dicas e atenção quando teve uma tempestade de neve. Eu só tenho a agradecer. Eu realmente recomendo que você se hospede em lugar onde você possa se sentir seguro.[QWERTY123]Cyn is the most amazing host, super welcoming, friendly, warm, attentive, communicative and caring. Her house is a spectacular artistic project, spotlessly clean, super comfortable, perfectly located. I truly enjoyed staying with Cyn and believe this is the absolutely perfect place to stay in NYC. Highly recommend![QWERTY123]Cyn es una gran anfitriona. Pasé ocho noches en su apartamento y aun habiendo otras dos personas hospedadas, siempre tuve privacidad. La habitación es muy silenciosa. Cyn está atenta a lo que necesites y a responder a las preguntas. La ubicación es ideal porque hay dos estaciones de metro, una a 70 metros y otra a 300 metros, desde donde se puede acceder en 15 minutos al centro de Manhattan. Por Lexington hay muchos lugares para tomar café, almorzar, cenar y se percibe tranquilidad y seguridad a toda hora.[QWERTY123]Great apartment to stay in, nice size room with enough space for all clothes and essentials. Location is excellent for public transport, local food and shopping. Will definitely be staying here again if I go back to New York[QWERTY123]Cynthia is an amazing host. During my month long stay, she made sure that I had clean sheets, fresh pillows and towels, and even made smoothies and dinners for me and the other guests during our stay! Her place is beautiful, eclectic and cozy. Great location as well as it is one block away from the 6 subway line, a few blocks away from Central Park, and close to many grocery stores, places to eat and a 24 hour pharmacy.  Would not highly recommend more for a great and convenient place to stay in New York!!"	40.78962413372014	-73.94802016385479	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/6990	1	75.0	0.8
39	7064	"What a great spot. The apartment is spacious and relaxing. The neighborhood has tons of great food and is great for getting to Manhattan or other neighborhoods in Brooklyn. To top it all off Joelle is very communicative and went out of her way to accommodate my travel plans. I would certainly go back the next time I'm in NY.[QWERTY123]Unfortunately, I didn't get to meet Joelle, but her place is super cool and with lots of character. It is located centrally in the Williamsburg area. There are a lot of interesting shops, cafes and bars just a step away from the apartment. I had a chance to meet and chat a bit with Joelle's roommate below as well as one of the neighbours and they were both extremely friendly and helpful. I had a great time here and would love to return again when in Brooklyn/NY.[QWERTY123]un lugar ideal para relajarse y vivir el ambiente de Williamsburg en un espacio muy acojedor y con buenisima energia. Excelente anfitriona.[QWERTY123]The apartment was great, the location was perfect and Joelle was a great host - very helpful ( especially considering I booked very last minute ). I'd definitely stay again.[QWERTY123]We had a very great time at Joelle's place ! the neighborood is a very charming one and the room we lived in was very spaceful and nice.[QWERTY123]My daughter and I stayed at Joelle's place for about a month and it was an overall wonderful experience. To start with Joelle was great throughout about providing consistently clear and concise communication,  just enough to be helpful but not at all intrusive.  
She was there to meet us even as our arrival time was somewhat ""iffy"" and late night.  She provided us with several pamphlets about local attractions, events, etc., suggested several late night eateries, and drew maps to subway stations close by. 
Though Joelle was out of town for the remainder of our trip, she left us well supported with information, contact info. for herself and neighbors, and checked in with us a couple of times throughout our stay. 
Joelle's roommate, Annie, who was there for part of our stay, was a wonderful balance of friendly, helpful, yet respectful of using the common areas and of our privacy. 
The apartment is just as fantastic as it looks in the photos. The bedroom area is a large open area containing within it a cozy living area and a long desk/work area backed with wall-to-wall book shelves. The kitchen and bathroom(on the same floor) were a nice size for our needs.  Both spaces have ample skylights which of course provided great natural lighting and completed that amazing airy loft feel. Joelle had thoughtfully cleared storage space in the closet, kitchen, and bathroom areas, so we had more than enough space for our belongings.  We ended up eating quite a few meals at home and the kitchen efficiently met our needs. The space in general provided a very comfortable and peaceful refuge at the end of our busy days.
The apartment is located in a great neighborhood, very convenient to a wide variety of restaurants, shops, etc.while not being in the midst of too much noise and commotion.  There are two subway stations within comfortable walking distance, a bus stop close by,  and there's even a movie theater at the end of the block. (My daughter, a cinephile, was in heaven!) In terms of security, the neighborhood felt very safe and the apartment itself has two locked doors to gain entrance, so security was never an issue.
In a one-sentence wrap-up, we loved the whole experience and would do it again in a heartbeat! Thanks Joelle and Annie!

[QWERTY123]You'll find Joelle's Boho-chic apartment deep in the heart of boisterous Williamsburg. If you wanna get to know the area there's no better place from which to do it. Joelle is responsive, kind, open and full of only good intentions. With the L train a short walk away you're minutes from Manhattan. I recommend the waterfront and the Polish bakery on North 8th.[QWERTY123]Such a wonderful place, super calm and relaxing, and very welcoming host at the last minute![QWERTY123]Joelle is fantastic. Intelligent, classy, and welcoming. She made sure everything was taken care of, and followed up to make sure I am enjoying my stay. The place is beautiful and spacious. I would gladly stay here in the future (though thankfully my housing situation is resolved!)"	40.71264260808676	-73.95862442929824	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/7064	1	150.0	0.783333
40	7097	"A great space for a fair price in one of Brooklyns best neighborhoods. Bed was comfortable and had access to a washer dryer which was extremely helpful as well as nicely appointed sitting room   There were many wonderful eateries within a 4 or 5 block area
I highly recommend this one[QWERTY123]Gorgeous brownstone renovation in a nice neighborhood.  It definitely WAS ""perfect for parents"".  We had the top floor with big, comfy bed.  Attention to detail, immaculately clean, welcoming host.  Highly recommend this.[QWERTY123]Highly recommend.  My parents recently stayed with J., they loved her house.  J was friendly and hospitable, offering a tour of her entire home which blew them away - J. has put tremendous love and effort into restoring her brownstone.  

The garden unit was clean, large, and beautifully furnished.  And the attached garden was extremely attractive.  

The bed is a foldout but reportedly quite comfortable (and my father is a big guy, he presents a real test for a bed!).  The ""kitchen"" has a sink, coffee maker, fridge, but no stove/oven.  

I give J.'s place four stars only because the last guest had not adequately cleaned the dishes and there was no sponge with which to do the job, we had to go out and buy one.  Minor quibble.  Apart from that, it was a five star experience for a fair price.[QWERTY123]We felt so lucky to have found this garden apartment and were well taken care of by J! Fort Greene is an amazing area close to the city but quiet, lush (at least in May) and full of great places to eat. The apartment is on one of the nicest streets in the area, close to everything but still peaceful. It was very clean, beautifully renovated, the bed was comfy and the kitchen perfect for our needs - which was breakfast, because honestly, if you are in NYC to visit you should eat out as much as possible. The garden is lovely and was perfect for breakfast or for drinks in the evening. Highly recomended![QWERTY123]J made us feel at home instantly.  The townhouse is airy, bright, and VERY clean. The top floor was a comfortable and roomy getaway.  We hope to return.[QWERTY123]Beautiful place, excellent location and great accommodations. J was very considerate and gracious. Would stay there again on our next trip to New York.[QWERTY123]Clean, private and lovely accommodation. Treated well. Would stay there again.[QWERTY123]My husband & I had a Wonderful stay in Brooklyn, we loved the neighborhood~& were bowled over by the beauty of J's home & furnishings.

An absolutely perfect little getaway, Highly Recommended!![QWERTY123]Great place and great location.  Everything you need is less than a block or two away.[QWERTY123]i stayed on the top floor, which had beautiful light. Everything was clean and new, the place felt like a fancy hotel. J is an excellent host.  I would certainly stay here again.  The neighborhood is safe and full of great places to eat and useful stores, and a nice park. I wish I lived there. 5 stars without hesitation.[QWERTY123]My wife and I stayed in the garden apartment for three days and we could not have been more pleased.  J made it very easy to get in and get ourselves comfortable.  The WiFi worked great, the bed was comfortable, and the shower is fantastic.  This is a spacious place with your own entrance, the rooms are clean, and the sleeping is at the back where the overhead fan makes it even more likely that you will sleep peacefully.  We needed to set the alarm to get up in the morning — it's that quiet.  We would be glad to stay here again, in fact, we will make this our first choice the next time we're in Brooklyn.[QWERTY123]Even though I would not recognize her from her photo, the person we met was lovely, as was her apartment, conveniently located in a beautiful part of Brooklyn, and so quiet that we overslept! We hope to stay there again on future trips.[QWERTY123]Beautiful, quality rooms and garden, in a lovely neighborhood; so much nicer than a top notch hotel room. Convenient to subway. Owner is practical and helpful but not intrusive.   A great way to experience Brooklyn brownstone living at it's best. We will be back.[QWERTY123]We rented the top-floor space and found it beautiful, spacious, and very clean- and just around the corner from many excellent bars, restaurants and cafes. Conveniently located to several subway stops.

J was also an excellent host and made the entire transaction easy and worry-free. 

We'll definitely be back.[QWERTY123]We spent two nights in the beautiful Garden Apartment, and we didn't want to leave.  The apartment was spacious, clean, comfortable, and thoughtfully decorated.  We really enjoyed the large garden in the back--quiet and peaceful.  The host J. was great, very friendly and accomodating, giving us helpful info on everything.  We would most definitely stay here again.[QWERTY123]The top floor is gorgeous and very clean. The photos don't adequately show the charm and spaciousness of the place. There is a beautiful stained glass skylight in the landing area and a small room that is connected to the bedroom by French doors that has the closet and dresser as well as an additional window. The ""laundry room"" is also on the top floor and looks more like a dining room with a big table and chairs and was only used by me. 

The place was very quiet with a view through the trees outside of the other brownstones on the block. The neighborhood is very attractive with restaurants and stores.

J was very responsible. 

[QWERTY123]My stay at J's place could not have been better (stayed on the third floor).  It's gorgeous and much bigger than the pictures make it seem.  There's a kitchen-like room with a table and chairs (though just a sink, no fridge or stove/microwave), a beautiful bathroom, a bedroom and a dressing room off to the side.  Plenty of natural light through windows and skylights and very tastefully decorated.  It was an absolute pleasure to be there.  Feels very private even though people are living downstairs.  We neither heard nor saw anyone until we were literally walking out the door to leave.  However, J made it known that we could reach if we needed anything.  Would return in a heartbeat.  Thanks, J![QWERTY123]J's place is beautiful, and my parents really enjoyed their stay.[QWERTY123]Wonderful stay in J's garden apartment -  charming, spacious, clean, conveniently located, and safe.  
J was great - very friendly, helpful, and thougtful. We appreciated everything from the coffe beans and coffee grinder to the wine glasses.  We hope J's place is available if we go to NYC again![QWERTY123]J's place worked out perfectly for our stay.  We walked to wine shops, restaurants, my daughter's apartment... It was a perfect location for us.  The apartment was quite nice.  J even had a coffee grinder and whole bean coffee in the room for us.  On our 1st stay in Brooklyn we stayed at the Nu Hotel.  It was nice, however, the price, room, comfort and location of J's place was a MUCH better option!  Thanks J![QWERTY123]Excellent stay. Beautiful building with five-star furnishings. Great interactions with the host. Fun neighborhood. We're true believers![QWERTY123]A beautiful space in a gorgeous neighborhood.  J made us feel comfortable and at home.  I will recommend her place to my friends.[QWERTY123]This was a great find - and really perfect for parents. Plenty of space and well looked after, the garden is beautiful for relaxing days reading the papers. It's right around the corner from Fort Greene and the C, G and N, Q trains.  Perfect.[QWERTY123]What an amazing place to stay (we were in the garden apartment)... the rooms are of a generous size and the quality of the furnishings and design work is of an extremely high standard.  The garden is such a treat to have, especially in a big city like NYC.  The kitchenette was perfect for making tea and had plenty of useful dishes, glasses, utensils, et cetera.  The bed was large and comfortable, the television is huge, the shower is powerful and gorgeous and J was so helpful and responsive to any questions - we had total privacy while we were staying in the apartment, but she left us her number so we could ring her if we needed anything.  It is such a wonderful place to stay, so much nicer than a hotel - we would definitely go back and will recommend to all our friends.[QWERTY123]Nice/safe location. We had the whole top floor and it was lovely. Very clean and nicely decorated. Had a kitchen area, own bathroom with a deep tub, and a separate room area for the closet. It felt very roomy and made you forget you were in the busy crowed area of Brooklyn.[QWERTY123]Stunning home in great location.  Perfect for ""parents"".  We stayed on the third floor; beautiful furnishings and very private.  Host was entirely accommodating with facilities.[QWERTY123]I booked the garden apartment for my parents and it was indeed perfect. They loved the place and thought it was wonderful to have a ""home"" to stay in while visiting their new grandson in Brooklyn. They found the bed very comfy and the apartment was charming. We will definitely look to use this location again for future visits![QWERTY123]We were in the garden flat. Great and adorable place in a quiet neibourhood in Brooklyn. The subway is quite close. Safe. Jay is a good person. I recommend it 100%.

Thanks Jay for all!![QWERTY123]My visit to NYC was wonderful. I love Fort Greene! Jay's apt  is lovely and cozy. The apt is a couple of blocks from the subway and an easy ride to the city. I will stay again![QWERTY123]The  apartment is beautiful and comfortable and located in a great neighborhood--good restaurants and cafes, and a block from the park.  J couldn't have been more friendly or accommodating.  We hope to stay there again.[QWERTY123]we stayed for 6 nights in November / December while visiting our daughter and were delighted to have found this accommodation. Every bit as nice as it looks in the ""advertising"" and in a picturesque, accessible Brooklyn location.
the host is welcoming and accommodating and it was indeed ""perfect for parents""
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED[QWERTY123]Great place in a perfect location.[QWERTY123]This garden apartment was lovely, with interesting appointments throughout and careful attention to decor. I stayed 4 nights, and enjoyed being able to work in the apartment. The weather two of the days in March was nice enough to sit and work outside. J was very accommodating, prompt in responding to any questions or needs, and flexible on check in and out.[QWERTY123]Pros: Good location within walking distance of many good restaurants along Dekalb. Seven blocks to G or C subway. The bathroom is large and well lighted. The apartment is large.

Cons: Bed is uncomfortable. Second mattress atop sleeper sofa is foam, it's mushy, soft, worn-out, has a tendency to roll you to the middle, not good with two adults. Sheets, bedding are showing signs of wear, pulled off around corners every night. Would give this place more stars if the bed was better and for the price per night it should be better. 
The back yard chairs and tables were very dirty and could not be used.[QWERTY123]Very private fairly spacious flat. Lovely garden was a major plus over a beautiful weekend. Wonderful location, close to everything! 

The only reason I'm not giving it 4 stars and not 5 is because the bed is on a pull out frame, so it may not be comfy sleeping for everyone, but we slept fine and truly enjoyed 2 nights at the apt. 

We plan on being repeat visitors![QWERTY123]We had a delightful stay at Perfect for Parents visiting family in Clinton Hill. The apartment is spacious and the weather was great for enjoying the garden patio. Jay is an accommodating host as well. Great location with everything we needed within walking distance. Highly recommend![QWERTY123]Great quiet apartment with great light and a lovely backyard.  Beautiful new bathroom with a fabulous shower.   It really did feel like a home away from home.[QWERTY123]As advertised.  My mother and sister stayed there for my wedding  in early October and had a great time.  The garden is beautiful.  The kitchen area is lovely.  Everything was clean.  It is my favorite neighborhood in Brooklyn.  I'm sure my relatives will stay again.  Jay is very helpful.[QWERTY123]We had a very pleasant experience at Jay Al's place.  Jay Al was an excellent host and the apartment is as seen in the pictures.  No complaints whatsoever!!![QWERTY123]I loved our stay at Jay's.  The setting and beauty of her place was unexpected. The photos don't do the home justice.  We were very happy.  There was plenty of room to spread out.  The little sunroom doubling as a place to snack and make coffee or tea was so cozy.
The neighborhood is beautiful, close to subways, little cafes and restaurants.  Fort Greene was made a historical landmark in the late 70s so history is present and thick.[QWERTY123]excellent host.  very friendly and prompt communication.  place was  bigger than I thought it would be.  would stay again.[QWERTY123]J's property is beautiful. She is a gracious hostess, very thoughtful and welcoming. We had complete privacy in the basement apartment with our own private entrance. The apt is tastefully decorated and clean, the garden is beautiful to wake up to in the morning. The neighborhood is lovely, lots of brunch places within 1 to 2 blocks and an amazing coffee shop 1/2 block away. Fort green park is a short walk, we spent a few hours just roaming around the neighborhood.  
I highly recommend this apartment. We had an excellent time![QWERTY123]Loved our stay![QWERTY123]Epic apartment laden with character! Stellar backyard, fantastically located near Fort Greene park! Why would we ever consider a hotel ever again?![QWERTY123]Lovely apartment in a very cute neighborhood. Very comfortable, adorable garden. Slightly longer walk to the subway then I would have liked but easy to get to. Thanks![QWERTY123]We had a fantastic stay in this beautiful garden apartment in a really cool part of Brooklyn. We couldn't fault the apartment or our host and would highly recommend it. A great first air bnb experience![QWERTY123]We've been travelling to NYC/Brooklyn for over 13 years.  We've never had two nights as quiet and peaceful as the two we spent here.  The neighborhood is quiet, yet close to anything one could want in entertainment, food or necessities.  The garden is beautiful (but you do have to be careful as there is some poison iv y growing).  As long as our family lives in the area, we will try again to stay here.[QWERTY123]This is a great space-- quiet and private and actually very lovely. We particularly enjoyed being able to go out and sit in the garden when the weather was good-- it's so unusual to have your own private green space in NYC! Also quite convenient to a number of trains, and such an adorable neighborhood.[QWERTY123]It was a wonderful place for our holidays. Everything excellent, we felt at home. Exquisite details on decoration and attention. The appartment is private and located in a very nice neighbourhood, near the subway and some good restaurants.
We were received by a very nice and kind woman, who was always available for us, and offered us help, information and advice, very useful to enjoy the amazing New York city. Thank you!!![QWERTY123]A very lovely apartment that suited our needs perfectly! Highly recommended.[QWERTY123]Best place in Fort Greene neighborhood, and not just for the money, all around. The location is prime with all the great shops, cafés and restaurants within walking distance (I recommend Dekalb Ave. and Myrtle Ave.) This is one of the nicest and safest neighborhoods in I have stayed in in Brooklyn. Oh, and a cool Farmers Market in the Forte Green park every Sat. Jane was phenomenal. She made early morning accommodations to meet me upon check in and gave a bright eyed and bushy tailed tour of the place. Everything was super nice, loved the decor and it was very very clean...spotless! There is also a private outdoor patio that most people in Brooklyn would kill to have...[QWERTY123]We stayed at Jane's place at the end of September and really enjoyed this garden suite. The place was very clean, nicely decorated and spacious, with access to a pretty garden and patio outside. The house is located on a beautiful and quiet street and is close to many great restaurants and shops. Jane was accommodating and responsive to all our requests. The only thing to be mindful of is that the bed is actually a pull out couch. We found it rather comfortable nonetheless.[QWERTY123]We had a great stay at this apartment!  Everything went very smoothly--we felt bad having been delayed in transit, but Jane met us with the key and explained everything very graciously despite the late hour.  It was a nice set-up--a separate ground floor apartment with its own entrance, but the owner lived in the building, so we felt like it was easy to be in touch with her if we needed anything.  As it happened, the place was great and we didn't need any help.  

The apartment is nicely decorated and very homey.  We liked the huge bathroom and the views of the pretty garden.  We were nervous about the sofabed, but it turned out to be very comfortable, and we slept very well each night.  

Fort Greene is a gorgeous neighborhood full of classic brownstones, and though we'd lived in New York before, exploring this area was a whole new adventure.  The park is a short block from the apartment, and it is lovely.  We also walked to Brooklyn Flea and many great restaurants in the neighborhood.  There is quite a brunch scene around! (Our favorite place we tried may have been Cafe Paulette, with its classic French atmosphere--it is only a few weeks old!) We also walked to Park Slope a few times, another lively neighborhood which is not too far.  Just be aware that most metro lines are a 10-15 minute walk--it was totally fine for us, and we spent most of our time in Brooklyn, but just know that getting to Manhattan is not a matter of a few minutes, if that is important to you.

We had a great stay and would highly recommend this apartment!  It was comfortable and left us well-positioned to explore one of New York's most charming neighborhoods.[QWERTY123]We had a wonderful time!  The space is private and lovely - the garden gives it an airy, even larger feel. J. was there to greet us, knows the neighborhood and was very accommodating.  We are looking forward to our next visit.[QWERTY123]My dad loved the place and will come back.[QWERTY123]Airbnb

Fantastic place for enjoying Brooklyn … or even Manhattan since it’s close to transit.

We drove in from Virginia and found parking within a few spots of the door in mid-afternoon. (Left the car parked there the rest of the weekend, but noticed a regular turnover of parking spots.)

Space is tastefully done, quiet … and really spacious. This is not a hotel room or a suite – it’s a full apartment. I enjoyed having coffee in the rocker in the kitchen/sun room every morning. (There’s coffee to be made or you can dash down to the corner and buy two bagels and two coffees for less than $5. We bought.)

The only hitch was the bed, which J. clearly states is a sofa bed. I slept (and napped) like a rock. My wife, who is half my size, complained that she kept rolling into me. Lesson for all of you: Don’t sleep with me.

We sampled the neighborhood restaurants, all very good, and strolled through Fort Greene park people watching New Yorkers being surprisingly normal. 

Too cold for garden, but we enjoyed looking out at it. It must be spectacular in the spring.

Never used Airbnb before. We’ll be back. And we'll be back to Perfect for Parents, With Garden.
[QWERTY123]J. was very accommodating and answered all the questions we had before and during the stay. The room was convenient, clean, and cozy. I booked this room for my parents and they were very comfortable there. Thanks, J.![QWERTY123]Amazing place, really friendly host! Absolutely great place to stay in Ft. Greene, 1 block away from the park.[QWERTY123]My kids planned a weekend in Brooklyn in April 2013 to celebrate my 50th birthday  My daughter and I stayed here, and loved it so much, we came back again on May 16/17/18, 2014, to visit my son, who lives near by. The apartment is lovely, comfortable, and well furnished. The garden is beautiful and we enjoyed coffee, cocktails, and long conversations there. This neighborhood has great coffee shops and restaurants, and is within walking distance of Fort Greene Park. We especially love the Brooklyn Flea, Cafe Paulette, and Bergen Bagels. 

J. is a thoughtful and considerate host. We are already planning another visit for late October.[QWERTY123]J.'s Apartment ist ein wunderbarer Rückzugsort nach einem langen Tag in Manhattan. Die ruhige Strasse und der grüne Innenhof wirken nach den hektischen Grosstadteindrücken sehr erholsam. Die nahe gelegene Dekalb Ave bietet eine Vielzahl an guten und abwechselungsreichen Restaurants. Wir haben uns in der geschmackvoll eingerichteten und gemütlichen Wohnung sehr wohl gefühlt.
[QWERTY123]Our stay was outstanding! We loved visiting with our two Brooklyn sons on the back patio among the rhododendrons. The shower was one of the best I've ever had, the bed was comfortable, and morning coffee at the Red Lantern/Bike Shop was just two blocks away.[QWERTY123]We stayed here while visiting family in Fort Greene.  Location was perftect - close to the park and restaurants on Dekalb and Lafayette.  The apartment was very large and clean and had everything we needed for a comfortable stay! J was very easy to work with.[QWERTY123]J's home is on a beautiful quiet street in Brooklyn. She was easy to communicate with and completely flexible about check in and check out times. The house is spacious and has everything you need. The back garden is beautiful and a nice change of pace for NYC. We loved staying here and would do it again![QWERTY123]J was a very nasty and negative person. From the first moment we met I felt I had to go out of my way to be nice just to get her to feel more comfortable with me. Her place is nice I will say that but she is the only person I have ever had a problem with in my entire airbnb experience![QWERTY123]Yes i felt welcome and the location is perfect!  The home is gorgeous and well appointed.[QWERTY123]This is a very comfortable and quiet apartment in a great Brooklyn location, close to restaurants, bars, coffee, trains, and Fort Greene Park. The owner was very accommodating to our schedule and made sure we had everything we need. The apartment is large, the bed is comfortable, and the garden is private and relaxing. And all on a beautiful tree-lined street. A great choice.[QWERTY123]J's place was fantastic!  Cool neighborhood, great apartment.  J was very accommodating on my arrival time.  Thank you![QWERTY123]Super location in pretty neighborhood. The garden provided a quiet retreat. J. was kind enough to rush home to greet us when we arrived earlier than expected. The place and experience were perfect for parents, indeed.[QWERTY123]J is a welcoming and gracious host. The accommodations are exactly as described, and actually much better when experienced.  The apartment we had was the bottom floor of an exquisite brownstone, located in the middle of the Fort Greene section of Brooklyn. What we really liked, is the easy access to other parts of New York via the subway.  Easy walking distance to the Q (at DeKalb and Flatbush) which goes right to mid-town; the A&C (at Metro Tech) which goes right up 8th avenue through Times Square; and the G (at various stops) which goes to Queens through the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn.  Plenty of restaurants and coffee nooks for meals and bagels within easy walking distance.  J was easy to communicate with, and went out of her way to help us out when needed it.  This is an A-one stop for a New York visit.[QWERTY123]This is a great place to stay!  My wife and I stayed here for 2 days, over New Year’s, while visiting friends just a few blocks away.  We drove in and there was plenty of free on-street parking. We arrived early and found a great place to have a cup of tea and a bit to eat before our host arrived, exactly when she said she would (J was very easy to coordinate with).  
 
The place is beautiful – just like in the pictures.  The bed is quite comfortable.  As an insomniac, I was worried about the sofa bed, but I had no trouble sleeping.  The kitchen was perfect for what we needed (microwave, sink, coffee pot) – just keep in mind there is no oven or stove top. 

The neighborhood is fantastic, with plenty of shops and restaurants within easy walking distance. I wish we were there in warmer weather to enjoy the garden.
 
My wife and I highly recommend this place![QWERTY123]Our host was on site when we arrived and showed us around the apartment, pointing out specific things that would be good to know during our stay.  The apartment was nicely decorated and had everything we needed.  The location was terrific, right near our son and daughter-in-law, who live in Fort Greene.  We were able to walk easily to their apartment, to BAM, Prospect Park, and Pratt Institute.  
We really enjoyed our stay and hope to come again.[QWERTY123]Great place! Warm and spacious for Brooklyn - has nice garden out back. Good location near the park and not too far from subways. Really enjoyed staying here and my father liked it as well.[QWERTY123]J was very accommodating for my mom's recent stay in Brooklyn. The apartment was exactly as described: a very well kept, beautifully decorated and clean apartment in a lovely brownstone with a backyard garden. We especially enjoyed the location - right around the corner from Fort Greene Park and walking distance to a wide variety of restaurants, cafes, and, if you're around on a Saturday, the farmers market and Brooklyn Flea Market. Thanks J![QWERTY123]Lovely garden apartment in great location in Fort Greene, Brooklyn. Clean and spacious! The bed was a pull-out couch but very comfortable. Towels were fluffy, shower pressure was super strong, bathroom was spotless; bring your own shampoo. I'm already booked for my next business trip to NYC![QWERTY123]This space is not only perfect for parents but for anyone wishing to stay in Brooklyn.  We were warmly welcomed by J., the host.  This home is a carefully restored Civil War era Victorian Brownstone.  It is worth a visit to enjoy the interior.  We stayed in the bottom level which has three rooms including the bedroom  There is a kitchen area with windows that look out on a private garden.

The location is convenient with easy access to local restaurants, markets, and the subway.  We found our visit was enhanced as we were able to experience some of the local Brooklyn  culture.  It is within easy walking distance of Pratt Institute.
[QWERTY123]perfect place near to the park and restaurant
Nice and patient owener[QWERTY123]Clean and spacious in a great area. There is now a real queen bed rather than a pull out, which is great.[QWERTY123]J was very welcoming and helpful.
Communication was great.

The apartment is in a perfect location - there are some amazing restaurants and bars around and it's close to the park and subway.
The apartment is quiet and peaceful.

All in all an wonderful stay.
Thanks!
[QWERTY123]Great location![QWERTY123]Nice location on a quiet street.  Apartment is located on the bottom floor of a charming brownstone with access to a nice garden in the back.  

The set up is a bit different than the pictures (bedroom is where the living room is pictured and living room is where the bedroom is pictured) but that does not affect the quality of the stay in fact enhances it as the room in the front can be darker for better sleep in spite of being on the street side.  There is a real bed (not sofabed).  Very nice and modern bathroom adjacent to the bedroom.  

Kitchen facilities were perfect for us; small refrigerator, microwave, sink and coffee maker.  Guests should be more mindful of future guests by leaving clean cups and silverware (we found coffee cups put back like they were clean but were not - the host should not have to inspect every cup, plate and piece of silverware on departure of every guest).

Wifi worked very well for us and there were lots of channels available on the tv.

Several Metro stops close by; getting into the city center is very easy. Nice diverse neighborhood where we felt quite safe walking home later in the evenings.

Host is very accessible if you need her and kindly offered the use of laundry facilities when requested.  

We found several excellent restaurants within walking distance of the apartment and lucked out on arrival to find a parking spot right out front.

This was our first Airbnb experience; we would recommend staying here and hope to visit again.[QWERTY123]We enjoyed staying in this comfortable, spacious, clean unit. J. was entirely accommodating, and it was fun to be walking in the neighborhood and see our host out and about too. This is a great location, super close to Fort Greene Park, but also within walking distance of the Brooklyn Navy Yard (interesting guided tours) and just a bit farther, Brooklyn Bridge Park (fantastic views, great public spaces). Downtown Brooklyn and the subway are not far. There are plenty of interesting restaurants close by. Hope to visit again![QWERTY123]J. was great! She was super accommodating and flexible as I had some communication problems with my parents at first. Her place was absolutely perfect for my parents. The location doesn't get much better for Ft. Greene and my mom is already talking about how she wants to come back. I highly recommend staying here.[QWERTY123]I had a great time with nice host and cozy house and town.

[QWERTY123]The place was cute.  I wish I had more time to spend in the apartment itself. It was a great place for what I needed. The shower was awesome.[QWERTY123]My mother and I had a lovely stay. J. met me when I arrived and gave me a tour and orientation of the apartment. Everything was as described - no surprises. It was tastefully decorated and well-maintained. The neighborhood is great - centrally located with lots of restaurants, coffee shops, and grocery stores, and Fort Greene park is a block away. We would definitely stay here again.[QWERTY123]This was a beautiful, spacious place in a very nice neighborhood.  J. has decorated this so well and created a space that seems homey without being too obviously someone else's actual living space. Because she lives upstairs, you are not dealing with someone else's clothes and toiletries which often seems too intimate and invasive.  We did not need her help for anything since our son lives in the neighborhood but she seemed like she would be available if we had. We did not use the outdoor space but it looked lovely.  We would definitely stay here again.[QWERTY123]Perfect for Us!  We have stayed in ""Perfect for Parents"", private upper floor, as well as ""Perfect for Grandparents"", private entrance garden apartment.    Both accommodations are architecturally pleasing, quiet, with comfortable bed(s), while providing all the amenities (restaurants, farmer's market, neighborhood parking, access to subway) of Fort Greene area.   
J. was very accommodating and helpful during our stays!  Whenever we go to Brooklyn we keep our fingers crossed that ""Perfect for Parents"" or ""Perfect for Grandparents"" will be available!  Just stay here![QWERTY123]This is the best Airbnb I've had in Brooklyn. Great location. Great shower![QWERTY123]J contacted me with key and entry info...and the process was simple and easy. She makes it hassle free to stay there. The space was very open and felt like a home away from home. I maintained contact by email and when I returned ""home"" each night, she had fulfilled mu requests. The apartment is very quiet and in a good neighborhood...near restaurants, a great farmer's market and...near my son and his family.[QWERTY123]Clean, pleasant, and very spacious for the neighborhood.[QWERTY123]This was a terrific place to stay. The apartment was large and very comfortable and very clean The host was kind enough to let us leave our luggage late into the afternoon of our departure day.  We liked the neighborhood. It is  quiet residential.  We would go there again. 
[QWERTY123]An excellent place to stay! The apartment is very spacious and comfortable. The street is quiet and pretty, and walking distance to many great restaurants. The host was very accommodating with check in and check out, and showed us around the apartment when we arrived. Highly recommend![QWERTY123]This is the second time that I've stayed here and everything was as smooth and professional as the first time. The location is great with lots of restaurants and coffee shops nearby. The home is very comfortable too.[QWERTY123]We loved the neighborhood.  We have traveled many times to Brooklyn and this is one of our favorite neighborhoods to stay in.  The apartment was convenient to many of the restaurants we like and also to our son's apartment.  It was very quiet at night and we loved that.  The apartment was comfortable and nicely decorated.  We would definitely recommend this apartment to others.[QWERTY123]J. was a wonderful host, our every need was taken care of.[QWERTY123]J.was welcoming and very helpful with information about the neighborhood and how to make our way around the city. Our spacious rooms were in a beautiful art filled brownstone on a quiet street in a charming neighborhood. Parking was easy and there were excellent restaurants within walking distance. The beds were comfortable and the large garden area in the back was a great place to sit and relax in the afternoon. We look forward to returning.[QWERTY123]J. was a great host. Checking in and out was a breeze, and any questions we had were answered quickly. The pictures are accurate, and the place was beautiful, clean and comfortable during our stay.[QWERTY123]Comfortable and convenient!  We really enjoyed the neighborhood, the comfortable bed, and the interesting décor and art.  It was rainy during our visit so we didn't go into the garden much but we were still able to enjoy it from the large kitchen windows.[QWERTY123]Nice place, great location, responsive and helpful host.[QWERTY123]Fantastic apartment in a wonderful and quiet neighborhood. Very relaxing, but still easy access to Manhattan[QWERTY123]Great space, amazing location, and a beautiful garden. I would definitely stay there again. Though I never met J, she made sure that we had everything that we needed to be comfortable.  A great find![QWERTY123]The neighborhood is vibrant and a little funky.  It was Afro-punk weekend, which contributed.
Our host was available and willing to chat, and ""stoop-sit.""   
It's a very nice apartment and garden, very comfortable.[QWERTY123]J was very helpful and accommodating. Her place was comfortable, clean, and in a beautiful neighbourhood. Would definitely come back.[QWERTY123]J was a perfect host - she let me in and gave me all information I needed without prompting.  Communication was great and the place is lovely - beautiful old brownstone with plenty of space and  great interior decoration.

Thanks for having me and hope I can stay with you again![QWERTY123]J was not able to meet me when I arrived at her lovely apartment, but she made good arrangements for me to get the key.  I met J that evening and was very helpful getting me settled.
The apartment is big and very comfortable.
The kitchen was my favorite room.
I would stay here again.[QWERTY123]J's place is fantastic! Great location. Comfortably appointed with everything we needed. Very quiet street in lovely neighbourhood. An easy 10 minute walk to the train to get into Manhattan.[QWERTY123]This was our first stay with Airbnb and it set the bar pretty high. We were given a tour upon arrival to make us aware of all the amenities. The accommodations were warm and inviting, the mini fridge came in quite handy, and the shower was excellent. The television was big and cable was provided, but we were too busy with our trip to need this feature. Although the weather was quite gloomy, the outside garden area looked very welcoming. The bed was on the firmer side for my tastes, but my husband had no issue with it.[QWERTY123]Jane was super accommodating. She met us later in the evening when we were able to arrive and she was so incredibly sweet and caring with my kids. This place is really perfect for parents though and I would definitely book it again.[QWERTY123]My family was so very pleased with this beautiful apartment. Communication was great, home was spotless, amazing location. We would absolutely recommend it![QWERTY123]J's place is just as described. A lovely and spacious garden apartment in an excellent neighborhood.  It was very comfortable for my parents' stay. Even though it does not come with a full kitchen, which we knew - J offered them to use the kitchen upstairs. J responded quickly and answered all our questions and was flexible in our arrival time. I will plan on requesting her place on subsequent visits and would recommend it to anyone.
[QWERTY123]""Perfect For Your Parents"", yes![QWERTY123]Charming and spacious place that was perfect for my mother-in-law. Brooklyn garden unit in an authentic beautiful brownstone. Host was accommodating and communicative. Will book here again![QWERTY123]Our accommodations were on a quiet street in Ft Greene, handy to the Ft Greene Park, restaurants, cafes, and shops.  Our rooms were large and elegantly furnished; the kitchen small but perfectly functional; and the garden peaceful and calm. For a couple this is a great place to stay for weeks on end; but if others are  with you sleeping on the fold out couch in the other room, it is a bit awkward as the shared bath is off the master bedroom.
This is a lovely, stately, comfortable place to retreat to whilst in NYC.  Highly recommended.
[QWERTY123]Had a wonderful time a J's place. Very spacious, amazingly comfortable bed, and she everything we needed. Safe, quiet neighborhood, amazing location. Great restaurants and coffee nearby. Also would be great for anyone who can't handle many stairs-- it's garden level, so it's two steps down and that's it. Definitely would stay there again.[QWERTY123]We have stayed here three  times, for a week each time. It is everything you could ask for in a getaway. It is homey, very spacious and beautifully decorated. The kitchen is on the opposite end of the space so you don't have to creep around in the morning if someone is sleeping. And you couldn't ask for a nicer host. The neighborhood is lovely, interesting and people are very friendly. You can easily walk to the Brooklyn Academy of Music in ten minutes, where we saw three first run movies. There are plenty of bars and restaurants and you are close to Fort Greene Park and public transport. You won't be disappointed![QWERTY123]This is our second time staying with J and, as seems to be a theme, everything was perfect.[QWERTY123]Jane has decorated this Brooklyn garden apartment in a way that synced with our own eclectic tastes in detail. The location was perfect for our needs when visiting a nearby friend it gave us our own space.[QWERTY123]I cannot recommend this apartment enough. Beautiful, clean, excellent location and excellent host. What more could you ask for? J. was incredibly accommodating of our needs and did everything she could to make sure our stay was lovely. Would absolutely stay again in the future.[QWERTY123]We enjoyed the proximity to several subway stops.   We were within 30 minutes combined walking and riding time on the subway to anyplace in manhattan.  J's place is close to good stores, drug stores, a nice wine shop and good restaurants. The place is exactly as pictured.  We really liked the historical brownstone building.  We felt safe.  J was very responsive and helpful.[QWERTY123]Excellent apartment.  Great location.  The outdoor garden was beautiful.  The host was very nice and helpful.[QWERTY123]We used to live in the neighborhood and wanted to stay there during our most recent visit. All the reviews were great, so we booked. When we had a few questions, communication was easy and J. was helpful.
The place was clean and comfortable and more beautiful than the photos, as good as they were, depicted.
We'll look into this again next time we visit.[QWERTY123]A very comfortable stay, close by to wonderful restaurants and transportation and located on a beautiful tree lined street. We would definitely stay there again when visiting family in Brooklyn.[QWERTY123]we really like the Fort Greene area of Brooklyn and we really liked this particular airbnb  - delightful place, slept well[QWERTY123]Lovely apartment. Would definetly recommend. It doesn't have a full kitchen but all the amenities of a hotel room plus charm and a garden.
Was perfect for our brief trip!
Thanks J![QWERTY123]Definitely perfect for parents.  Garden level with pretty garden.  No stairs to climb.   Very roomie ....large bedroom with bath,  large living room but small kitchen with microwave and refrigerator only.    Clean and J was always right there if anything was needed.  We would definitely return.  It was perfect for us as it was only down the block from our daughter's place .   Hairdryer included .   Felt very safe in neighborhood and great eateries .   Love Brooklyn ![QWERTY123]J was a fantastic host, the apartment is beautiful and the location in Brooklyn is  great with lots of restaurants and cafes within walking distance.  We spent 10 days there and enjoyed our time a lot[QWERTY123]We loved this space. The apartment was comfortable, welcoming and spacious. The garden was a lovely space to have tea and read in the morning. So may little thoughtful touches made us feel very welcomed. J was very communicative and helpful. We HIGHLY recommend this lovely AirBnB![QWERTY123]Wonderful stay, lovely garden and convenient to everything! We will return!
[QWERTY123]Had a great stay. I booked this airbnb for my mother and myself. J generously made the pull out couch bed for me. The kitchen nook was a great place to have coffee in the morning. I love fort greene so i thought this was a great location.[QWERTY123]J's place was, as advertised, great for parents! My MIL and Brother in law were in town to meet our new baby so we needed something close (we live in downtown Brooklyn) and spacious. The location was ideal and J was an exceptional host. She met me in person to give me the lay of the land, which offered plenty of space for the two of them. J had an extra room available at the time of their stay and graciously offered it as well at no extra charge. The garden was a big part of why we booked the place, and it was gorgeous. J had warned me ahead of time about the mosquitoes...I would recommend bringing repellent if booking in the summertime, they were pretty aggressive! Overall very happy with J's place and her generous hospitality.[QWERTY123]great place to stay! Super cute and super attentive host![QWERTY123]J's place is the perfect place for us to stay when we visit our daughter in Brooklyn.  J is quick to respond and helpful with any questions.  We hope to stay there again in the future.[QWERTY123]J's place is spacious, homey and nicely decorated. Good communication with host and the neighborhood is great. Definitely a great home base if you are wanting to stay in Brooklyn. Loved it and felt very much at home.[QWERTY123]The home is a comfortable, clean, large space with a lovely garden space. It is well decorated to feel like a warm home. Amazing water pressure and comfortable bed and seating. It's in an ideal location-- on a leafy, brownstone-lined street, in walking distance to restaurants, the park, and the subway.  A great way to experience Fort Greene and beyond.[QWERTY123]J, was a great host! The apartment was just what I and my husband needed. The location couldn't have been any better.[QWERTY123]This was EXACTLY what we needed. My family is scattered about Manhattan and Brooklyn, and when we come back to visit we really need to be in a central location that is a spacious ""home base"" for us. This location is the best! It's central to all the best places in the neighborhood and it's so easy to get into the city.  We generally don't spend that much time in the actual place, but this was perfect for coming in, relaxing, and having a comfy place to do our morning routine and sleep.

1) the bed is huge and comfy...and you should set an alarm if you need to wake up early because it gets SUPER dark. We slept so late the first morning because it was so cozy.

2) note that there is a kitchenette--no stove, but a coffee maker, and J. had a bunch of take out utensils and stuff like that for anything we might bring in. There's also a yard that we didn't have the time to use, but it's there. 

3) the wifi isn't as strong in the living room as in the bedroom, and my husband had to do work, but there is a couch in the bedroom so he was able to work in there. 

J. was super responsive and helpful with check in and check out. We'll be back.

Thank you![QWERTY123]This was the perfect place for our visit to NY. Not far from the subway to get to the tourist spots of the city - absolutely beautiful walks.  The garden was like you’re own private Central Park. J was a wonderful host and made us feel at home.[QWERTY123]J's place in Fort Greene is SO lovely and comfortable. A beautifully decorated and accommodating space in one of my favorite parts of Brooklyn. Would stay here again![QWERTY123]Great spot.[QWERTY123]Great location in Fort Greene! The apartment was clean, comfortable, and extremely well decorated with many unique furnishings. J. was communicative, and check-in and check-out was very easy. I would absolutely recommend this apartment, and would happily stay here again next time I am in NYC![QWERTY123]J. was very accommodating and communicative, and her place is terrific!  It has a great, cozy vibe and is right in the center of wonderful Fort Greene. Can't recommend it enough.[QWERTY123]J's space is terrific.  The king bed is comfortable and the bathroom is roomy by NY standards.  The amenities you hope for in a place to stay ""away from home"" are there.  Quiet street ... great location ... all good![QWERTY123]Short walk to subway and ride into Manhattan. Plenty of local options to eat. Safe and quiet neighborhood. Easy to find on street parking.[QWERTY123]Great location - a minute's walk to Ft. Greene park and wonderful restaurants and coffee shops.  Easy to get to public transit.  Beautiful brownstone full of interesting art work and books.  Comfortable and cozy sitting area and private kitchenette.  Modern bathroom.  Quiet neighborhood.[QWERTY123]Great place in a great location.  This is the little downstairs apartment you wish you had when out of town family comes to stay. Warm, homey, and just a block in either direction to everything you need. J was so very accommodating in every way. She was there for our late night check in and totally flexible with check out time. Thank you thank you for sharing your home with us.[QWERTY123]This was our second time staying at Jane's airbnb and both times were excellent! She was very accommodating with flexible check-in and check-out times, and the house is SO beautiful. We will surely be staying again the next time my parents are in Brooklyn![QWERTY123]Jane was very helpful and responsed quickly. Easy check-in and check-out and we could even put our bags in her apartment until we left for the airport. The apartment is very pretty and quiet. Nice neighbourhood with cafés and restaurant. Subway is close (3 different stations) and gets you almost anywhere. Overall a great place from which to explore Brooklyn and the rest of New York![QWERTY123]Jane’s place is a lovely garden level space in her beautiful brownstone. The bed was very comfortable and the living area was great for relaxing. Her place is super close to Fort Green park, coffee shops, great restaurants and the subway. She is a great hostess. She is easily available, friendly, and it’s evident that she cares about the comfort of her guests. We would definitely stay here again.[QWERTY123]El departamento está muy bien con un jardín muy agradable . Bien ubicado y Jane es buena anfitriona[QWERTY123]We were so lucky to stay in a place as beautiful as Jane’s. You couldn’t ask for a more beautiful interior, to get the complete historic Brooklyn experience. And the space is huge - the big bedroom, the en suite, the living room, and terrific kitchen looking out onto the beautiful back garden which is a wonderful and peaceful oasis (which you may well need after escaping from Manhattan).

Outside, the apartment is on a quiet street of Brownstones, but only a couple of minutes walk from great coffee shops, restaurants, bars, train stations, and the tranquility of Fort Greene Park.

Most of all, Jane is a wonderful host - wonderful tips and thoughts on what to do in the neighbourhood, and being amazingly helpful in letting us store our luggage.

We’d stay here again in a flash, and would absolutely recommend this amazing apartment to anyone.

Thanks Jane - can’t wait to see you again soon![QWERTY123]Jane's place was the absolute best place that we could have stayed in Brooklyn. It was located near 3 subway stations so it was very accessible from the airport(s) and it was also super easy to get around Brooklyn and to Manhattan. The apartment was cozy and clean with a really nice kitchenette. Jane was very prompt in responding to messages and was very welcoming when we arrived. In a beautiful neighbourhood near lots of coffee shops, restaurants, and parks![QWERTY123]Jane's place was great - a great location, and clean, spacious, and comfortable for my husband and I and our 7-month-old. Jane was very responsive when we asked about check-in and check-out procedures. We didn't end up using it much, but the garden was beautiful, too![QWERTY123]A wonderful place to stay if you want a feeling of what Brooklyn used to be and is now.[QWERTY123]As advertised, it was a great place for my parents to stay while visiting. Jane was very responsive and accommodating.[QWERTY123]I highly recommend Jane's place as somewhere to stay in Brooklyn.  The space is very spacious and Jane is incredibly accommodating.  From start to finish, Jane was great at communicating with us to ensure that our weekend stay was everything we needed.[QWERTY123]Beautiful apartment in the Fort Greene neighborhood. A very short walk from the park, subways, and many fantastic restaurants (get brunch at Olea, especially the eggs + salmon or the French toast that includes seseme seeds). After spending the day in Manhattan, I very much enjoyed sitting in the quiet backyard with lovely trees and ivy for an hour. The backyard is also quite visible from the living room and mini-kitchen, which makes the whole place feel like a great oasis. Only small thing was that the wifi  was a bit slow, at least in the bedroom. Ooh...on the plus side, also a very nice bathroom and shower. Easy to walk or hop on a Citibike to nearby neighborhoods too. Hosts we're very responsive and easy to coordinate arrival with. Overall we really liked our stay in Brooklyn, and definitely feel like this place was a part of that.[QWERTY123]Jane is a great host - she checked in with us during our visit to make sure we had everything we needed,  The flat is lovely, the street quiet, the neighborhood and park vey nice - a great respite from the hustle bustle of the city for those of us visiting from more rural areas!  We'd definitely stay with Jane again if the opportunity presents itself.[QWERTY123]big, comfortable space very nice.[QWERTY123]Jane is a fantastic host. She was super accommodating and made our stay extremely comfortable.[QWERTY123]Jane is a fantastic hostess. She was very responsive and helpful. She has a beautiful place in Ft Greene.[QWERTY123]Jane,
Thank you so much. You have a beautiful home. Your  hospitality and flexibility was above and beyond all expectations. 
I am looking forward to a future stay with my husband.[QWERTY123]Great place. Comfortable and private. Very kind host who will anticipate your needs.[QWERTY123]This is a quaint place with a ton of character. Great value and awesome location! Recommend[QWERTY123]This is our second stay here because it is in such a lovely area near Fort Greene Park (and around the corner from our son's place).  It is really comfortable and stylish and Jane is great at helping you (personally welcomed us in case we had questions, gave us late check out, etc.) and the place is very roomy with a living room and garden out back.  The small kitchen is fine for breakfast with small fridge, microwave, kettle and coffee maker and she offers a kitchen upstairs if you contact her.  Also, she has laundry facilities upstairs.  I definitely recommend this place as a lovely spot in one of Brooklyn's nicest areas.[QWERTY123]Jane biedt een basement aan, dus je komt in een kelderverdieping. Met ramen boven de grond en een tuin aan het gelijkvloers achteraan. De locatie is schitterend: rustig, groen en met veel ruimte. Het bed is fantastisch als je goed wil uitrusten. 
Je bent in Brooklyn, dus als je naar Manhattan wil moet je altijd een hele tijd metro doen. Het verblijf echter is een ware oase na de drukte van de stad. Er is bereikbaarheid naar alle kanten. 
Denk eraan om zeker in de DUMBO area rond te lopen: een geweldig voorbeeld van stadsvernieuwing en -uitbreiding. 
Brooklyn zelf verdient uitgebreide aandacht, met het Fort Greene Park dichtbij en iets verderop het prachtige Prospect Park.[QWERTY123]Jane's place was wonderful! The space was much bigger than I expected and was extremely accommodating. Jane provided everything we needed for our weekend stay in Brooklyn.[QWERTY123]Great spot with lots of charming details. After a long day of work, it was the perfect place to unwind and relax with many of the comforts of home. Jane was super accommodating to my late check in and communicative throughout my stay. I’d happily be back![QWERTY123]Beautiful and comfortable space, great location. Jane is a very responsive and generous host.[QWERTY123]Location is ideal for walking to fun places to eat, drink, and shop.  Home is spacious and very clean with charming decor,  plus a pretty courtyard for outside time.  Jane was the perfect host.[QWERTY123]Such a good place to stay.  A lovely comfortable home in an area with character a little away from the main busy tourist areas but with easy access into all the central parts.[QWERTY123]This is a spacious, comfortable and attractive one-bedroom apartment, with a garden out back.  There is a small kitchen area with a small refrigerator, table and chairs, coffee making equipment (plus coffee, creamer and sugar),  and microwave.  The location in Fort Greene is close to the park, to many restaurants and bars, and in our case, to our son and daughter-in-law.  We very much enjoyed our stay."	40.69168544458396	-73.97184549390258	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/7097	4	215.0	0.733333
41	7241	"John was a great host,understanding and helpful.His place is perfect. Great location clean and quiet.[QWERTY123]Great location and clean apartment. Well equipped kitchen for cooking at home. John was very nice and helpful – he even showed us around in the neighbourhood before leaving. Very good accommodation for a low price![QWERTY123]The location is great! Apartment is clean with comfy bed and good water pressure in the shower. It's in a quiet neighborhood with a subway station just around the corner. We will definitely come back - good value for money![QWERTY123]What a fabulous location and John was great!! Very prompt in his replies and gave good advice about travel links. The apartment was clean and very quiet considering it's central location. There were shops close by and a 2 minute walk to the subway. Would definitely recommend!![QWERTY123]Lovely!  John is great, the place is neat and comfortable, the location is very convenient - I felt like a local for a week.  I would definitely stay here again.[QWERTY123]A perfect base for a perfect vacation. It couldn't have been any better - location nor the appartment itself. Clean, quiet and comfy. We are mos def going back![QWERTY123]We had a great first trip to NYC and John's hosting and the fantastic apartment he rented us definitely contributed a lot to the trip being as good as it has been.

John was an extremely approachable and helpful host throughout the experience and accommodated his plans to our very odd travel schedule (we got in to NYC at 11pm and left on a 4am flight). 

Superb location for all meals (Chelsea Market's dope by the way, and there's really good authentic Italian about one block up), shopping, and/or grabbing a quick drink.

Will definitely be heading back to John's on Horatio on our next trip to NYC.[QWERTY123]awesome pad:   i don't actually want to write the great review i have in my head, 'cuz i don't want the apartment to get all popular and overcrowded and then it won't be available for EVERY time i'll be staying there AGAIN...
[QWERTY123]An apartment very well located which allows to visit New York in ideal conditions, a subway nearby, great bars and restaurants nearby. John is also very available. Truly a great experience.[QWERTY123]Wow.  I lived in NYC for several years and would recommend this place to anyone!  The location is superb, the apartment charming and very clean, and John was a pleasure to deal with.  On my next NYC visit, I will make sure to arrange my travel dates to coincide with the availability of this amazing crib![QWERTY123]We had a great couple of days in New York and John's apartment had a lot to do with it. He was a delight to deal with: replying to our emails, giving us directions around the neighbourhood, and making it easy to get (and leave) the keys. The apartment is quiet, clean and in a great location. And along with a fantastic book collection and stylish furniture, the AC was an added bonus since it was over 90 when we were visiting. One of Airbnb's best kept secrets!!![QWERTY123]This place is so perfectly located,couldnt of asked for a better location, close to everything,the subway,all the restuarants and shopping.
The unit was very comfortable with a very comfortable bed, great water presure in the shower, and John was the perfect host, gave all the information that I needed about the area befor he left.
Thanks John, defenitaly will be back mate.

James.[QWERTY123]John is a great host.  The apartment is in a prime location in the picturesque West Village on the edge of the slick meatpacking district.  Subways to everywhere nearby and the Hudson River is blocks away for runners and walkers.  Truth is if you don't mind the walk up you can't beat this place.  And the walk up will keep you in good shape.[QWERTY123]The location, the apartment, and the host are all fabulous. John responds to emails quickly and is very friendly and helpful. I loved the location, wandered the neighborhoods in all directions, the subway is very close and convenient, and it was quiet for sleeping at night. I loved the decor of the space itself, vintage flower paintings and wood furniture, the raised bed next to the window where you can gaze at the city lights at night. The best thing was feeling like a local for a week. I highly recommend this place![QWERTY123]Very nice apartment in an unbeatable situation in New York (west village). Friendly neighbors and tons of restaurants/shops around.
John is a good host. We had some problems (which had nothing to do with him) and he did everything on his hand to solve them.
I'd recommend the apartment to any couple or single person who wants to visit manhattan. It's got also a big table, which is perfect for writing (my job!).
[QWERTY123]John was very nice and very helpful. He left several phone numbers so that we could find him for any question and at any time. The apartment is in one of my favorite neighborhoods in NYC. The bathroom is not the best because the shower doesn't meet my standards of hygiene but the apartment is bright, with a good bed, kitchen and a perfect location.

John es una persona encantadora y muy servicial. Nos dejo varios números de teléfono para que en todo momento pudiéramos lozalizarle para cualquier consulta. El apartamento está en uno de los barrios que más me gusta de NYC. El cuarto de baño no es lo mejor ya que la ducha no cumple mis estándares de higiene pero el apartamento tiene mucha luz, una buena cama, cocina y una localización perfecta.

[QWERTY123]John is really a nice host. He's fun and even speaks portuguese!

Perfect location, near the High Line Park, subway, restaurants and shops. We had a great time at John's place. The view from the bed is great. Everyday I woke up and spent a little time watching the children playing at the park in front of the apartment.

If we come back to NY, we would definitely stay at Horatio again.[QWERTY123]A lovely apartment in a phenomenal location. John, who is a passionate, creative and incredibly helpful person ensured that my stay was comfortable and stress-free.

I recommend this apartment without hesitation.[QWERTY123]Hemos pasado una semana muy agradable en el apartamento de John! La cama era muy cómoday está muy bien situado, a tan solo unos metros de la estación del metro y a 2 paradas de Times Square.
No tuvimos el placer de conocer a John en persona pero el trato por mail y por teléfono fue inmejorable, muy agradable y dispuesto a ayudar en cualquier cosa.
Nos dejó las llaves en una tiendecita cerca del apartamento y sin problemas.
Esperamos poder volver pronto!
Gracias por todo Jhon![QWERTY123]John's profile is very accurate, he is certainly a mellow person. We loved to stay at his place, which will only be even cooler when the playground outside is finished. I do not hesitate to recommend this place very highly.[QWERTY123]AMAZING location!  The subway is so close, and there are connections to many lines.  The street is surprisingly quiet even though there are lots of great restaurants and shops nearby.  John was very helpful.  We had the BEST time![QWERTY123]We had amazing time at John's appartment. The location is the best to get to any part of Manhattan (and the whole NY). The apartment is very clean and cozy, and even little funny. John was very helpful in any kind of quiestions. Thank you, John.[QWERTY123]The apartment was brilliant and John was fantastic to deal with. Friendly, honest and gave us great recommendations for obscure but incredibly delicious restaurants.
Perfect area to be in if you're visiting New york – close to markets, galleries, subway and restaurants. Can't recommend this place enough. Made our trip.
[QWERTY123]John was very welcoming and relaxed. The apartment was a great base for our New York holiday. Very close to L train station at 14th which helped alot when it started snowing. between West Village and Meatpacking district, there are heaps of great restaurants and bars nearby. 
There was a couple of hitches with the apartment (wifi and building issues) which John did everything he could to sort out. 
Would recommend this cute, functional, well positioned studio.[QWERTY123]The host canceled my reservation 21 days before arrival.[QWERTY123]The place was in a very good position. I really liked the furniture in the apartment. John is really nice and helpful. We'll come here next time we'll be in NYC! Reccomended.[QWERTY123]A trip to New York is always a great - no matter what. But when staying in an apt as super swell as John's, it's a life changing experience.

It's located perfectly in the meat packing district, a short walk from everything you will ever need. You can walk from the apt and straight into the very heart of Manhattan (think 5. avenue shopping district) within 15 minutes. There are lots of very nice restaurants and bars everywhere you walk in the neighborhood. The subways is just around the corner, not more than a five minute walk. 

The apt it self is very nice and clean as well. Perfect for a short and long term stay. We stayed for ten days, and it was all rosy. 

John was the perfect host and was very helpful in every thinkable way. He answered all our texts and e-mails promptly and was just great and friendly guy. 

The next time we visit NYC, we will not accept staying anywhere else than at John's place. A true gem.[QWERTY123]It's obviously a guy's apartment. But it has the top 3 essencial things: PERFECT location, relaxing shower and confortable bed. As a bonus, John is super kind and friendly, aswered every single question we had and helped us a lot. Thank you very much, John! Hope to see you again soon. : )[QWERTY123]John is a wonderful host with great communication and was gracious in accommodating our special request.  Excellent location, warm and cozy, comfy bed, hot shower, quiet building overlooking a playground.[QWERTY123]We enjoyed staying at the West village. The apartment is located in an amazing area and it's really close to a subway, restaurants, Bleecker street, shopping, etc. John was great to communicate with. He was overseas and always replied to our emails on time. We would definitely stay at his place again!.[QWERTY123]The location of John's apartment is the best one to knowing New York. It stays in a very cool neighborhood. It's near of a subway station, but you can go to a lot of amazing places by foot from there. The apartment is very comfortable and it has an excellent view from de bed to a little park in front of. I was there in the winter, and the heating system worked very well. John is a very interesting guy and could help us in every little problem. Besides that, he can speak spanish and some portuguese, what's may be very helpful if the guest is not so fluent english language (like me). I'd loved that place and I'll recomend, certainly.[QWERTY123]We loved our stay at John's apartment. The place is small but really comfortable, we felt at home from the first day. The high bed is so cool to look out through the window at night while lying! And the location couldn't be better.
John was very nice, easy to reach and helped us with all our questions. We have already recommended the apartment to some friends who will be visiting NYC soon.[QWERTY123]We had a wonderful time staying in NYC and at Johns studio - truly a gem, perfect location and surprisingly quiet (we slept with the windows open!). Nice to have an italian style espresso cooker, too. John is a great host, very sweet and caring, interesting and replied super fast to any questions. Overall a great experience![QWERTY123]The best location ever between Meatpacking and West Village. Bed and shower are good. Don't expect too much of the rest, but who needs that when you're in New York.[QWERTY123]John is a really wonderful host. Polite and easygoing all the time.
The apartment is exactly what he says: adorable. It is very comfortable with a  home feeling. The street is beautiful and there is a park just in front. The neighborhood is the best of NY for me, with streets full of trees, small buildings and good restaurants. Next time I go to NY I will call him!
Thanks John![QWERTY123]John's place is exactly as he says. It's a fabulous little bohemian hideaway seconds from Meatpacking and all the treasures of the West Village. It's small and simple, but a perfect way to enjoy this part of the city. John was a great host, despite being away when we visited. Can highly recommend a stay at John's on Horatio![QWERTY123]We really appreciated the location and good communication with the host. Would stay here again.[QWERTY123]really nice place in a very good position in a quiet area, but very trendy with loads of nice restaurants. John is a great host and always available in case of need.[QWERTY123]John was a perfect host, easy to communicate with and quick to respond to emails. The studio has everything you need if you choose to cook their own food, as happened occasionally during our two week stay. Comfortable bed and functional bathroom and shower. The apartment was bright, we liked that it was high up in the house and had a nice view. The area is superb, perhaps the coziest in Manhattan.[QWERTY123]Nice and well-located place, we spent an awesome stay. You can reach in 5 min the high line or the subway.
The bathroom is quite old-fashioned but clean.
We enjoyed the raised bed : we keep in mind!

Thank you John for your kindness and your warm welcome[QWERTY123]Excelente estadia en el departamento de John. El departamento es pequenio pero muy confortable y muy bien ubicado. El mejor barrio para vivir en NY. El edificio es muy tranquilo y la calle tambien a pesar de que a unas cuadras esta lleno de restaurantes lindisimos y el Chelsea Market, lugar imperdible.
A unas cuadras hay varias estaciones de subtes con las lineas para conectarse a cualquier lugar de la ciudad.
John y Cord fueron muy cordiales y solicitos. John  todo el tiempo me contesto en espanol haciendome las cosas mas faciles.
Recomiendo muchisimo el departamento  y espero volver pronto. Gracias John.[QWERTY123]John's place was in a convenient location and definately felt like home! It was clean and tidy, and a pleasure to stay in.
John was always very helpful and easy to communicate with! Would definately stay there again when I return to New York city!
Thanks heaps!!!!![QWERTY123]This was my first experience of Airbnb.  So I was very apprehensive!  However, John was a fantistic host and very communicative throughout.  
I travelled to NYC for the new york marathon which unfortunately had to be cancelled due to the after effects of hurricane sandy.  John kept me unformed prior to my arrival of the situation in the city e.g. the electric and heating problems.
I arrived in manhatten with most of downtown in a blackout.  However, John arranged for his friend (Cord) to meet me at the apartment to hand over keys and show me round the place (by candlelight!).  
After 2 days the electric and heating were restored which was a relief.  Although it was kinda fun to live by candlelight without TV for a while. :)
Johns apartment is exactly as seen in the photos and felt like authentic new york living! The futon was very comfy and a great design which I might copy! I've stayed in manhatten a few times and i think this was by far the most quiet place i've slept.
It's ideally located with restaurants, bars, shops and the underground close by.  I pretty much walked everywhere from battery park up to central park which was a great way to explore.  It's about an hour's walk to central park but if you're not as active there's 14st underground just round the corner and plenty of taxis around.

Overall, I had a great stay and would definately recommend John's apartment.  I'll be using Airbnb again based on this experience.[QWERTY123]John was a great host and very accommodating. The apartment is in a great area, close to everything you could want from NY. Shower was great and the apartment was warm to come in to from the cold. A great place to stay.[QWERTY123]Everything about my experience at John's place was great!  The apartment is wonderful, especially the natural light, open view and location.  John is extremely friendly and attentive before, during, and after your stay at his apartment.  I enthusiastically recommend his place on Horatio, and I look forward to re-booking it again very soon.[QWERTY123]It is our first experience with airbnb. And we are very glad that it began so well! We were met by Kenneth, it was very kind and waited for us despite that that we couldn't call in advance to it because of problems with communication. The apartment very much was pleasant to us, in it you feel comfortably, not as in the apartment which often lease. As it has a convenient arrangement, near the subway and shops. Golden mean between the Areas of Soho, Italian, Chinese and a time the square. Let's be always glad to return to John.[QWERTY123]Had the most wonderful time staying at John's apartment. The location is PERFECT to see the city. It is central to Greenwich Village, the Meatpacking District & Chelsea and even though so close to these busy areas, it is so peaceful!

The apartment itself is full of character feels so authentically New York; great comfortable bed, desk/working space & a great bathroom (brilliant shower pressure - this is important to me!). The building is great, secure and well kept. 

John was excellent to deal with; replying swiftly and extremely helpful with my stay - I can't recommend staying here more![QWERTY123]Super appart. Exactement comme la description. Quartier génial. Très simple de communiquer avec John et très arrangeant. 
Je recommande vivement !!

Great studio, like the description. The neighborhood is very nice. It was very simple to communicate with John, and very accomodating. 
I totally recommande this place +++[QWERTY123]Nice and cozy room.
John was kind and helpful.
Great location!!!
It was a great pleasure to be here.

Thank you John![QWERTY123]We had the most wonderful week staying at John's cosy apartment. It is in a perfect location to the West Village and Meatpacking areas, giving you a great taste of New York. John was a very kind and helpful host - nothing seemed to be a problem. We would definitely recommend staying with John.[QWERTY123]The flat is very nice and clean and John is extremely kind and helpful... The Meatpacking District is great and we enjoyed the holiday. Thanks John for all! Hope to come back![QWERTY123]we had a wonderful time at the apartment. the location is fantastic, everything you need and more is just around the corner. we could have spent the whole time exploring just the streets near us, and eating all the delicious food! the subway is very close by, an easy walk.
the apartment is exactly as John explains, and as you see in the photos. it is small, probably only good for a couple, but still very comfortable. the kitchen has all the basics. the bathroom is a little old, but functional.
the bed is fine, and has a great view of the street below. the apartment is also very quiet!
the whole place could have been a little cleaner, but this was not a worry. overall we had a great time, and would recommend it.[QWERTY123]loved this place.. location amazing![QWERTY123]The apartment was the perfect size for 2 people and had everything we needed - fridge, microwave, wifi and air conditioning. It's just down the road from the subway and close to plenty of restaurants and bars.
John was easy to get in contact with and would reply to emails quickly. Highly recommended![QWERTY123]No regrets ! John is an amazing host, friendly and available. Exclusive area in the heart of New York's life. Nice apartment. I would recommend it for sure ![QWERTY123]We had a fantastic stay at John's apartment. The apartment itself is small but comes well equipped (the kitchen is well appointed and has everything you need to either prepare full meals or just store and reheat leftovers) is exceptionally cozy and has a ton of character. In spite of being just a stone's throw away from the meatpacking district, 14th St, and 8th Ave, the apartment is quiet and peaceful - a great place to listen to sounds of the city without being overwhelmed by them. John was a very accommodating and helpful host. He was quick to answer questions, flexible with check-in and out, and provided helpful advice about the neighborhood. Thanks very much John - we hope to be back soon![QWERTY123]Un très chouette appartement très clair et surtout super bien placé ! Le quartier est top , tout proche de la high line et de chelsea market et de bleecker street ! John a été très gentil. Je recommande ![QWERTY123]John is a delightful and helpful host who was courteous throughout the entire process. The location of his apartment is beyond reproach with the subway, great restaurants and the river really close by. Highly recommended.[QWERTY123]It was a great trip to New York and the apartment was a part of it. The apartment and the neighboorhood was good. Everything you need is very close and you can reach every point in New York very quick. 
The apartment is comfortable and in a small street. John is a nice guy and helps to organize an easy and pleasant stay.[QWERTY123]PROS:
La comunicacion con John fue excelente y su predisposicion tambien.
La llegada y la partida fueron muy buenas.
La ubicacion del departamento es excelente, muy conveniente, en zona con varios recursos alrededor y muy cerca del subterraneo.
La cama es muy comoda.
La cocina esta equipada.
Internet funciono siempre bien.
Excelente relacion precio calidad.

CONS:
No es realmente una contra, pero si algo a saber, el departamento esta subiendo tres pisos por escaleras.

Suficientemente comodo para una o dos personas.
Definitivamente me quedaria de nuevo si fuera a Manhattan[QWERTY123]The appartement is really nice located in one of best zone of The city and John is always available and kind."	40.739083945189044	-74.00385050344381	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/7241	2	144.0	0.842857

Safe, comfy, friendly environment is key to a nice NY experience. Yaya takes care of all the details. If you're looking for a nice place to stay, this is the one. Nice TV, kitchen, tea, coffee, and you can cook anytime. It's a tourist dream come true! 

The neighborhood is nice, you'll be 5 to 10 minutes by metro to the museums, and the metro station is just a block away. 

I definitively recommend Yaya's places. It's better than a hotel, and almost home.[QWERTY123]I cannot recommend Yaya's place highly enough! She was making me feel at home.The apartment is nice and sunny and overlooks the main road. 1 minute walk from the subway, 5 min. to Central Park. The district is safe. Yaya thank you very much, I may see you again soon! 
G.[QWERTY123]If you had a long day in New York and you wanna say ""Home Sweet Home"" than this would be the right place for you. Yaya & Gus were very friendly, helpful and always there if you needed help.
The apartment is so beautiful and with your own keys you can come and go everytime. Subway is only a few steps away and it takes only 20min to the city.

So you should book it before someone other will do!!!

thx yaya&gus for everything!!![QWERTY123]and again 5 stars for your help after the ""vulcano-surprise"" :)[QWERTY123]Yaya Was a wonderful host. letting ,me use her appartment. she is so helpful with getting around in NY.

Arne och Annica from Sweden[QWERTY123]This was a really great apartment.  The pictures are nice but don't do it justice.

It was immaculately clean, very bright, lots of space and fully upgraded.  The location was very good - park across the street, shopping nearby and subway 2 blocks away.

Nicoletta was a very accommodating host and made every step of the process as easy as it could be.

I would rent this unit without hesitation and will again in the future.

Thank you Nicoletta!

Jesse[QWERTY123]My friend and I stayed in Nicoletta's apartment in early September and had a great time. The apartment is really beautiful and has everything you need. It is very close to the subway in a very colorful neighborhood. Great as a base to explore a really fabulous city! Thanks again.[QWERTY123]We had a great stay in New York - and much of that was having a great apartment to come back to after an active day.  Spacious, immaculate, and very comfortable. The apartment was true to the pictures.  While not in the heart of Manhattan, buses on Broadway and the subway stop two blocks away made getting around the city a breeze.  Check in and check out went very smooth. I highly recommend ""luminous and spacious"" apartment. This was my first Airbnb and it was great.[QWERTY123]Photos give a very accurate depiction. Very nice interiors, spacious and comfortable apartment. I really enjoyed the nice light and lack of clutter in the apartment. 
Location is extremely convenient, 2 blocks from subway on Broadway..can be in Columbus Circle in 10-15 minutes.  I returned around midnight a few times and area felt very safe.
Nicoletta is an excellent host: very helpful , considerate and responsive.[QWERTY123]I stayed in Niccoleta's NY app. with two other friends for nine days in April.
The apartment is very comfortable, clean and spacious, located in a very interesting surroundings.
Nicoletta was very nice and caring host who made sure that nothing is missing, so everything went according to schedule and appointment.
We really enjoyed it!
Next time we would definitely chose the same apartment:)
[QWERTY123]The apartment is clean, well equiped, near to subway station and close
to buses and comerce. The neighbourhood is not so clean but reflects the mix of people in New York..We had a pleasant stay in all aspects..[QWERTY123]Hi all, we stayed at Nicoletta's spacious luminous apartment for 9 nights (2 persons). It was really great. The apartment has everything you need and is very clean. The kitchen is very well equipped. My friend used the bedroom and I used the sofa-bed in the middle room, we slept like babies. The metro is just 1 block away (5 minutes walk) and from there you are in the centre of Manhattan in a blink of an eye. We very much enjoyed our stay in New York City, everything worked out well and we would definitely rent this apartment again should we decide to come and visit NYC another time. Many thanks!
Kitty and Marian
[QWERTY123]Great apartment, very roomy, wonderful kitchen. I stayed with my daughter so we each had our own bedroom. Apartment is very nicely decorated. Neighbourhood (Washington Heights, north Harlem) was OK, lots of small shops nearby on Broadway. Transportation (subway) close for line 1, a few blocks away for other options.[QWERTY123]It's been a pleasure to stay at Nicoletta's. She's been really helpful since the beginning, always in touch and answering all our doubts, besides she sounds (through email and by the phone) very very nice :)

Regarding to the apartment, what to say, it's incredible, very comfortable and very well equiped. Even though it seems to be far from the center, you have a subway stop (145 st -line 1) behind the building and within 20 minutes you are in times square. The neighborhood is not as busy as the center of manhattan but it preserves that pleasant hustle from the big apple.

I'll be back  in NYC, that's for sure,  and I hope I can stay at Nicoletta's apartment again.

Nicoletta,  it's been great ""knowing"" you.

Take care. Hugs

Javi&Cris (from Spain)
[QWERTY123]The apartment is really beautiful, really comfortable, really spacious, really clean, really luminous. It's perfect for 4 people and if you want for 5 too. When we arrived, we met Nicoletta's assistant who received us and who explained us some simple rules of the home. We also found some food for the breakfast. 
The only negative side is the big distance of the apartment from the main attractions of the city. For example it's 20 minutes far from Times Square with the subways or with taxi you can spend 25-30 $. 
The neighborhood is quite but there aren't there any restaurants, attractions or places to visit.
But a positive side is the price: it's very convenient!!
On the whole we are glad and pleased about our choice to stay in this apartment and about the owner Nicoletta of the home who was very kind and helpful with us and our questions.[QWERTY123]Having spent about two weeks in Nicoletta's apartement I can give it the highest marks. It is bright, nicely furnished, impeccably clean and adorned with works of art by the owner herself, who is a professional artist. The location is somewhat on the outskirts of Manhatten, but the subway line no. 1 is very close by. (Hint: Change at 96th Street for the express trains 2 or 3 to get faster to the City.) The neighborhood is ""ethnic"", mostly hispanic and black. It is safe - I walked around a lot during all times of the day without the slightest discomfort. Although not around in person, Nicoletta has been very helpful and most friendly.[QWERTY123]E' stato il mio primo viaggio importante da sola,senza mio marito ma con figlia ,amica e figlio dell'amica.
Mi sono messa alla prova, insieme abbiamo organizzzato tutto e le preoccupazioni non erano poche,soprattutto gli interrogativi senza risposta.
Attraverso AIRBNB,con la disponibilità della gentilissima signora Nicoletta,ho potuto gustare al meglio queta mia nuova esperienza di vita.
Nessun intoppo,nessun inconveniente.
La città di New York è talmente complessa,viva e colorata che stancherebbe anche un allenatissimo maratoneta .per noi quindi era piacevole la sera poter tornare nell'appartamento Spazioso e Luminoso della Sig.ra Nicoletta per riposare mente e corpo.
Pulito,accogliente,intuivo il passaggio di tante persone che come noi vi hanno abitato senza però notare un deterioramento.
Siamo felici di questa bella esperienza.
Grazie di tutto a tutti 

Elena Bodini & Co.

We love NY
[QWERTY123]We spent 2 great weeks in the apartment. It is very spacious, very clean, and well equipped.
The neighborhood is safe, a very short distance to the subway station and a short 20 min. subway ride to e.g. Time square.

The interaction with Nicoletta was very smooth an friendly

We can highly recommend this place![QWERTY123]Nicoletta's apartment is absolutely wonderful! So spacious and comfortable, incredible amounts of light. The building is easily accessible from the subway, plenty of parking as well, an elevator and a ramp. The apartment has everything you could want for your temporary stay in the city: clean linens, towels, fast internet connection, a kitchen stocked with the basics if you plan to do some cooking. I felt very much at home. Nicoletta was very easy to get in touch with if needed and always so pleasant.  I would absolutely stay in this apartment again and also look forward to her property in Italy one day![QWERTY123]Nicoletta's apartment was spacious and luminous, as advertised. Just a short walk (although up a steep hill) to the 1 train and across the street from a leafy park and the Hudson.
Although the host was not around, she was very attentiive. We definitely had the impression she wanted us to enjoy our time in the apartment.
Nicoletta's assistant was also very friendly and helpful.[QWERTY123]Nicoletta's Riverside Drive apartment was, as advertised, large, spacious, and light. It's also well equipped and thoughtfully decorated. For visitors needing work space it was particularly useful having a large desk and comfortable office chair. Communication with Nicoletta throughout the process was efficient, and check-in and out with her assistant - Nicoletta was out of town - went exactly as planned. Two bits of advice to potential visitors. If you're travelling as a couple note that there's only a double (rather than queen or king) bed in the bedroom; there is also a double sleeper couch in the living room. If you're a light sleeper this apartment may not be for you because of the traffic din from the Hudson Parkway close by; otherwise just bring earplugs.[QWERTY123]
The AP is great! very comfortable, spacious and have everything we need (We thought it was smaller but got surprised). The light apartment in summer time... UFF! AMAZING. Is the best choice you can do with your NYC vacations.

Next time we are going to stay here again :-)

Thanks Nico! =)

El apartamento es genial! muy cómodo, espacioso y tiene todo lo que necesitas para una estadía perfecta (Cocina equipada, baño, wifi, tv, aire acondicionado, blower, plancha, toallas, sábanas). Tiene una luz bellisima en horario de verano. Es bien seguro, cerca del tren 1 a dos bloques, y el Bus M19 en la 145 que te lleva directamente al tren A-C. Es la mejor opción que puedes hacer con tus vacaciones en Nueva York.

La próxima vez vamos a alojar aquí de nuevo :-)

Gracias Nico! =)[QWERTY123]First of all the host is the best, extremely attentive, she answers your messages immediately, she is in contact to address any concerns, tips for your stay, and so on. Secondly, the apartment is extremely comfortable, exactly as shown in the photos, the area is very quiet, a bit far, but with a subway station a block away. We had a wonderful vacations in Nicoletta's apartment and surely we will use it again in upcoming opportunities. 100% recommended.[QWERTY123]My friend and I loved staying at Nicolettas flat - it's artistic, tasteful, spacious, clean and well equipped. We really enjoyed having so much space! I loved the walk-in closet:-)There's a lot of beautiful light in the flat as on the pictures - and a big mirror. We loved Nicoletta's artwork - so colourful and inspiring to wake up to every day - it really added something special to the experience. Also, Nicoletta was very welcoming and communicative and her ideas and recommendations of art galleries, contemporary art museums and a lovely local restaurant was a great help and inspiration to us. There's a swim and a park closeby and the flat is close to the subway station. Our arrival and departure went smooth and Clara who helps Nicoletta was very kind and welcoming. We'd love to come back to stay in the flat and give our best recommendations. Thank you so much, Nicoletta! Our kindest regards, Anne Marie and Anders Michael, Copenhagen[QWERTY123]Nicolettas place is amazing. i had a great time beeing there. nicoletta was a wonderful host! she took care of every single detail to make my stay even better. her apartment is sonny as her art is. i recomend it to everybody who is looking for a really nice place.[QWERTY123]Dear Nicoletta, we had a wonderful and cosy time in your apartment. Everything was fine and we felt like home :-) The apartment is nicely furnished and well equipped. It's located in a calm district and we felt at a safe spot. The metro is very close (4 minutes sidewalk). We had a very warm welcome and the whole booking process was very smooth.

[QWERTY123]If there is any place to stay in New York -Harlem it's Nicolettas apartment. She cares about you all the time and makes you feel home. I was in New York with 2 of my friends for 12 days and we felt so welcome in the first minutes. This apartment has such a lovely and good energy. Actually in my opinion the apartment is better than on the pics. We had a wonderful stay and would love to come back one day. Thanks Nicoletta! ❤ Love Wiebke, Antje and Nina from Germany![QWERTY123]Ich war mit meiner Freundin 1 Woche in NY Manhattan, Nicolettas Wohnung, die sehr geräumig, freundlich und sauber ist, trug dazu bei, dass wir einen unvergesslichen Urlaub hatten. 
Wir fühlten uns wie zuhause, es hat an nichts gefehlt!
Die Umgebung ist für NY Verhältnisse sehr ruhig, der Weg zur Subway nicht weit, auf dem Heimweg konnten wir abends noch in einem Supermarkt einkaufen.
Wir würden immer wieder diese Wohnung buchen.

Renate und Christa aus Mönchengladbach/ Germany[QWERTY123]Appartamento luminoso, spazioso, pulito e molto accogliente, in grado di ospitare comodamente 4 persone, quartiere tranquillo  con la metropolitana vicinissima. Io, il mio ragazzo e suo fratello abbiamo soggiornato per sette giorni e ci siamo trovati benissimo!! L'host e la sua ""tata"" sono state molto gentili e accomodanti nelle nostre esigenze!! Speriamo di tornarci prestissimo![QWERTY123]We came to  NYC for the pleasure of discovery and the adventure of a new place. This began with our first written communication with Nicoletta, her gracious warmth was very welcoming, her honesty reassuring. Consequently, there were no negative surprises. Her apt.was very quiet, spacious and full of light, very comfortable indeed. On days of rest, we stayed  in the neigbourhood, walked in Riverside park by the Hudson river. It was only 5 minutes walk to the subway and bus transportation was great. For us, it was ideal: safe, and totally satisfying our sense of adventure. We never had the pleasure of meeting Nicoletta but she was with us in her emails. It was Clara, her assistant, who warmly welcomed us and gave us the keys and apt information we would need. If we return to NYC we would love to stay again in Nicoletta's apt.[QWERTY123]Our host responded promptly and helpfully to our emails. The host's agent was there to let us in. The apartment was clean and creatively decorated. There's the convenience of city living with the subway and supermarket nearby but, as expected, there's the noise of traffic.[QWERTY123]We felt very much at home. Thank you Nicoletta.
It was lovely to have a place like that in busy New York. 
Clean, spacious and so cosy decorated.
The communication was always prompt and very supporting and friendly. If we come back to NY we would always chose this place again.

Thank you so much
Philine[QWERTY123]Nicoletta is a wonderful hostess - friendly, generous, and responsive - and her assistant Clara is quite proactive and so very kind.  
Small glitches (as happen on every trip) were dealt with expeditiously.  
Nicoletta's lovely Hamilton Heights apt has large south facing windows that bring in lots of light.  The bedroom has a treetop view of Riverside Park with the Hudson River in the background from one window (open the gate) and nicely kept townhouses from the other.  Hardwood floors, newly renovated bathroom and kitchen, a very comfortable queen sized bed with soft sheets, plenty of towels, and even a nice superintendent in the building made this a great find.  
Note:  I stayed in June while beautiful weather was abundant.  Block parties with music did occur until 12:00 am two nights out of seven.
If you are a previous resident of NYC (as I was for 17 years) or a new visitor, you may not know this part of town.  In that case Riverside State Park (across the street and down a sloping walkway toward the river) will be a delightful find (a small fee for Olympic swimming pools, tennis courts - free collegiate running track and weight room).  
Best of all, Riverside walkway runs from North of here to the tip of the island.  Take a day to stroll South along the Hudson River past long stretches of towering high rises to Chelsea Piers and beyond.  Go inland and take a tour of the Freedom Towers and 911 museum.   

Subway or bus travel is easy from here.  Buy a metrocard from a machine taking cash or credit in a subway station or from a local bodega. Use one of the cab or private car apps to get a cab on Riverside Drive

If you want to shop Madison Avenue or hit the clubs in SoHo, this is not the apt for you.  This is a home base that feels like home - if you live in an apt that was decorated by an artist with a clean, clear, brightly colored, somewhat minimalist sensibility![QWERTY123]I had a wonderfull time in Nicoletta´s apartment, the space is huge, and the decoration is nice. Fully furnished, the apartment works well for people who like to cook and experiment new ingredients when traveling. The hostess, Nicoletta, is very kind, helpful and comprehensive, from the first moment to the check out she was amazing, and I hope we keep in touch.
Thanks Nicoletta......!
[QWERTY123]Nuestra estancia en casa de nicoletta ha sido muy positiva.respondía a lo indicado en la oferta.Amplia,luminosa,tranquila y muy comoda ,con todo lo necesario para estar unos dias muy agradables......como si estuvieramos en nuestra casa.Un poco retirada del centro pero perfectamente comunicada con la línea de metro y autobuses.estar alejados del centro a cambio nos dio tranquilidad,y posibilidad de disfrutar de la zona.Una experiencia muy buena en todos los aspectos.perfecta la tramitación a través de la página web,y perfecta la comunicación  y el trato recibido por parte de nicoletta que nos dio mucha confianza ,respondió amablemente todos nuestros mensajes ,sugerencias y peticiones,dándonos facilidades para que nuestra estancia fuese lo mejor posible .[QWERTY123]My husband and myself had a wonderful stay and can highly recommend this apartment . The apartment was a retreat which was so relaxing after spending the day out exploring . We felt safe and secure . We were central to everything - shops , laundry , and the subway . Nicoletta is the perfect host - we have been communicating for months - and we were met by Clara when we arrived who was kind enough to greet us and fill us in on all the information on the apartment and also the surrounding area . 
Thank you for making our first trip overseas so memorable .
If you are looking for a spacious , super clean , safe haven to relax in after your daily outings this is the place to stay.
[QWERTY123]We had such a perfect time in Nicoletta's apartment!!! It's very well decorated, clean, calm and close to the subway station. I felt like I was in my own house! Nicoletta is also the best: very kind and polite and she's always worried about giving you the best experience in NYC. I highly recommend it!!![QWERTY123]Thank you Nicoletta. We had a wonderful stay and enjoyed your nice apartment very much.[QWERTY123]Très bon séjour dans le bel appartement de Nicoletta pour la semaine de Noël à New York ! Ce fut un plaisir de vivre ces 10 jours dans un espace aussi vaste et baigné de lumière. La cuisine et la salle de bains sont parfaites et les matelas excellents. Le voisinage est calme, ainsi que les habitants de l'immeuble. Le plus proche est même venu nous offrir une énorme part de tiramusu le soir de Noël ! Une très bonne adresse loin de l'agitation du centre de Manhattan. Et surtout la grande gentillesse de Nicoletta, toujours à notre écoute par l'échange instantané via Airnb. Grazie mille ![QWERTY123]Great stay. Very nice house very well connected with downtown area.
The house is amazingly clean and comfortable. Nicoletta is a wonderful host![QWERTY123]We had a fantastic time in New York in every way and far over our expectations! The assistant Clara received us as agreed and was nice and helpful and gave us good information about this and that.

According to the Description of the Apartment it says it´s light and calm. Yes, it is very nice and light but calm…well…
the Apartment is on a corner at the Riverside Drive with fairly busy traffic. Below this street goes another route along the river. Traffic from there you hear quite well even at night so bring earplugs!

Besides the traffic noise at nights I will approve to the description of the apartment. We felt at home and comfortable and the location was very good in terms of closeness to both the shops and the subway.

Attention! Remember that you can´t check in on Sundays at all and not later than 7 a´clock in the evening the other days of the week. Our flight from Sweden landed at 9 a´clock in the evening and it would take us perhaps another 1,5-2 hours to get to the apartment.  It was then too late for us to get access to the apartment. I understood that it was too expensive for Nicoletta to have an assistant receiving us late in the evening. A bit surprising for us considering that we paid a substantial sum for staying in the flat for 10 nights. The first night we therefore had to stay in a hotel. I have rented apartments earlier (in Europe), it has never happened that a late arrival has prevented us from being able to check in the date of arrival. We didn´t arrive from next door so to say. 
    
With respect to not being able to check in the arrival date and the traffic noise we will still recommend the apartment.

Kindly
Anne-Marie and Lamia from Sweden 
[QWERTY123]Un appartement bien équipé et spacieux (nous étions 4) bien placé sur la ligne 1 du métro (20 min de Times Square) avec des supermarchés proches. Nous avons été bien accueillis par l'assistante de Nicoletta qui nous a bien tout expliqué. La chambre principale est un peu bruyante la nuit à cause de la route proche et d'une mauvaise isolation au niveau du climatiseur. Je recommande cependant cet appartement.[QWERTY123]The reservation was canceled 103 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.[QWERTY123]I spent 2 months in this apartment with 2 of my friends and I must say it is a perfect place for a long time stay. The apartment is very well equiped with everything you need for cooking, and plenty of room for personal belongings, and a very pleasant bathroom. The beds are very confortable, and there is plenty of linen. 
There is a washing machine in the basement of the building that can be used for 5$, and there is even an iron and ironing board in the apartment. 
We really felt like home during these 2 months. 
Nicoletta is a perfect host : she was ready to answer all our questions before we made the booking, and even called me just before we left for NY, and this makes us feel quite confident. 
She also stayed in touch with us during the stay, always ready to help us with kind and useful advice. 
Carla, who welcomed us on our arrival and regularly came for cleaning, is also a very nice person. 
The situation is very convenient, near the metro which takes you everywhere you need, and near places you can go shopping. The neighbourhood is quite safe and secure. 
I recognize that the heavy traffic on Riverside Drive can some times be a nuisance... 
I highly recommend this place. 


[QWERTY123]We stayed with Nicoletta in her fabulous apartment in New York for almost a fortnight in the summer of 2014. We loved to meet her and we loved the vibe in Spanish Harlem. Every night was like coming home. The apartment is very comfortable, room enough for housing all the four of us (family with two teenagers). Good bathroom, good kitchen, good airconditioning. Lovely decorated, very stylish! Metroline 1 is only two blocks away and within walking distance there are also other lines available. Making arrangements with Nicoletta was very pleasant. Her responses were so quick and to the point. She gave us great tips about the surroundings. We definitely recommend her and her apartment and would like to stay there again the next time we'll visit NYC.[QWERTY123]My daughter and her boyfriend had spent almost ten months in this apartment, as freshmen at the New York University. The apartment was a true home for my kids, with all the necessary amenities. The space is ample, with a lot of natural light - in short, a beautiful apartment.
The proximity to the subway station was a big plus.
Our relationship with Nicoletta, the host, was very good. Everytime we needed to get in touch with her she was very prompt with her answers and everytime she provided all the help or clarification, as needed.
Nicoletta is really a great host.
For both reasons: the apartment itself and the host, we warmly recommend this apartment as a good place to stay in New York: a nice apartment, with a lot of natural light and very close to the subway. What more could one ask for?[QWERTY123]I love Sybilla's apartment. It is extremely roomy and has plenty of room for 2 people. It is well appointed with modern kitchen and bathroom. On sunny days the apartment is flooded with light and it's comfortably furnished with some lovely antique pieces. It's also very handy for transport, shops and Riverside Park for walks. It is right on Riverside Drive which can be noisy in the mornings although personally I didn't find this a problem as I am used to wearing earplugs.  Sybilla was extremely friendly and helpful in her communications.  I highly recommend the apartment and hope to stay there again on future visits.[QWERTY123]My wife and I had a wonderful stay at the apartment for almost three months. The apartment is very convenient with generous space, tasteful furniture and a fully equipped kitchen, which makes it easy to feel at home. It is a very bright place with sunlight all day long. We appreciated the excellent transportation link (Subway 1, which takes you directly to most of the landmarks in the Midtown and Lower Manhattan, is only two blocks away) as well as the groceries and many takeaways in immediate proximity. The neighborhood is safe and calm. Sybilla was a perfect host with fast and courteous responses to every query. We highly recommend this place and look forward to come back any time.[QWERTY123]Myself and a friend, stayed in Sybillas apartment for six weeks. We very much enjoyed our stay over the six weeks, the apartment is very spacious and comfortable. Ideal location as it was close to the subway and food stores, we also felt safe in the area. Sybilla and her assistant Clara were very helpful and dealt straight away with any queries we had. overall an excellent stay.[QWERTY123]Sybilla was an incredible host. My roommate and I stayed in her apartment for 2 months (June/July) as we both completed grad school. Sybilla always responded to emails, questions and was understanding of any issue my roommate or I had.[QWERTY123]Our stay at Sybilla's place was fantastic! We had everything we needed and the apartment was perfect for the two of us.  We rented the apartment for our semester at Columbia and would recommend this to anyone who is thinking of doing the same.  The apartment was spacious and we felt at home a lot sooner than expected.  The apartment is just as described and comes with everything that is mentioned.  What is not mentioned is the amazing care and attention that visitors receive from Sybilla.  The service was over the top, and she was quick to reply to any issues that we had (such as deciding on cleaning days, activating the heating, etc.) and was very professional.  The communication between her and the visitors was exceptionally good.  We loved our stay here and would book with Sybilla again if we return in the future.  Overall, the experience was a 10/10 and we cannot complain at all.[QWERTY123]Super large apartment with 2 public rooms and nice modern kitchen- very near subway, buses and Riverside Park.[QWERTY123]Sybilla's light-filled apartment is an oasis in Manhattan. The apartment is large with plenty of space for a couple. The kitchen and the apartment overall are fully equipped for a long term stay (we stayed for four months).  Sybilla is a terrific host. She responds within minutes with answers to questions, or solutions to any issues that might arise. The apartment is ideally located for exploring the city (the no. 1 train is two blocks away). The neighborhood has lots to offer on its own in the way of restaurants and basic food shopping, and Fairway Market is an easy walk away through Riverside Park. For long-term guests, there is a wonderful park right across the street with a 50 meter 8 lane pool and a running track with very reasonably priced monthly memberships.  We highly recommend Sybilla's apartment and we are already thinking about booking it  again.[QWERTY123]Our stay at Sybilla’s apartment surpassed our expectations. The space is beautifully decorated, is in a lovely quiet neighborhood close to Riverside Park, and ya all the amenities we could possibly need for a comfortable stay. I highly recommend this space for anyone who is hoping to enjoy a comfortable home away from home.[QWERTY123]Sybilla's home could not have been more comfortable or stylish. It truly felt like a home away from home.  The space is even more beautiful and cozy in person than in the photos, and we really enjoyed Sybilla's art work! There are many delicious restaurants and coffee shops popping up in this neighborhood, and we looked forward to our morning cup of coffee at The Chipped Cup every day. It is conveniently located one block from the 1 train, and just a 10 minute walk from the A, B, and C trains. Riverside Park is just down the street, and there are lovely quite streets with views of the Hudson River that we enjoyed walking daily.[QWERTY123]J'ai passé 1 mois et demi dans cet appartement incroyable. Les équipements sont au top que ce soit pour la cuisine ou le linge. Sybilla répond presque instantanément à toutes les questions! Elle gère parfaitement votre séjour de façon à ce que vous n'ayez qu'à profiter de votre voyage sans vous soucier de quoi que ce soit! L'immeuble est très propre et bien situé. (métro, commerces, parc...) N'hésitez surtout pas car cela vaut le détour! Rien que l'appartement en lui-même est incroyable de par sa décoration et la lumière! J'avoue que pour moi toute seule c'était peut-être un peu grand, mais avec tous mes ""bagages de fille"" il me fallait au moins ça! Que dire de plus excepté que depuis mon retour en France, les couleurs et l'ambiance de l'appartement de Sybilla me manquent cruellement! Merci encore pour tout chère Sybilla et à bientôt j'espère!"	40.82915232350532	-73.95136085850179	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/19159	4	120.0	0.833333

We had a wonderful week over there (Website hidden by Airbnb)[QWERTY123]Thanks for renting us your awesome appartment, we enjoyed our all 5-days trip and part of that is due to the place we stayed in.

Thanks Doti[QWERTY123]great place great folks god value[QWERTY123]Chelsea perfect is just that---it is in Chelsea and was PERFECT. It was a 5 Star experience--- from the BEST BED I HAVE EVER SLEPT IN (including my own!) to the incredible thoughtfulness of this host. I felt like I was home. I stayed with Doti for 6 nights--by the time I checked out, I felt like I was leaving a friend.

I could not recommend this listing more highly. Doti rocks![QWERTY123]FANTASTIC HOST, Doti is the BEST PERSON you can stay with in NYC. She goes all the way to make here guests feel like they are the most important. She is so nice after 5 days I felt I was leaving home. This is THE true NYC experience, so close to everything and safe neiborhood we almost never used the subway. 1/2 hour walk max to most attractions.
The apparment itself is perfect as you get to live within a very well stoked library with all the quiet you need for rest.The house is surgery room clean and there is a feeling of comfort about it.
Sincerly enjoyed our stay with Doti, do not hesitate to rent any lenght of time. 
[QWERTY123]We had a great time in Doti's apartment. 
Doti is a lovely host.  She was extremely helpful in giving us local information, excellent suggestions and insights in to New York life and culture.  The neighbourhood is brilliant.  We felt that the location and price were excellent.  We slept well and ate well.  Lovely breakfasts - thanks, Doti![QWERTY123]WE loved Doti and the room she designed for one to feel so special in.  She is a gracious host and has thought of everything for you to feel comfortable.  From the breakfast with so many wonderful healthy choices and the goblet of water at night to the wonderful talks we shared.  Although we only had one night to stay in our favorite city, out stay with Doti felt like pure vacation.  THe bed is great too.
we can't wait to stay again.--thanks Doti.[QWERTY123]We really loved our stay at Doti's place. She is a wonderful person and truely spoiled us during our time in NY. We stayed there 3 days and enjoyed every moment of it. 
Our room and the bed were very comfortable. We got to start our day with a delightful breakfast and end our day with talking and sharing our day's adventure with Doti. :)
Her love for the city and some our converations with her helped to put city in perspective for us as this was our first visit. She went out of her way to research things for us to do and places to eat (of course!:)) in NYC.

I recommend her place to anyone who wants to visit NYC and I would definitely stay there again.
thanks Doti![QWERTY123]This is a perfect place to stay it's very close to times square, nice, clean, comfy, close to many places to eat and the subway, it's all so very convenient. I really enjoyed my stay here and I will be stopping by next time I'm in NYC. Doti is such a wonderful host and really goes out of her way for her guests! Thanks again Doti!![QWERTY123]What can I say more than the others - it was a wonderful place with wonderful hosts. Doti & Kerry arranged everything that our children feel like at home, we too. Its a friendly, clean house with perfect open minded hosts, close to subway in the middle of NYC what you need more? Whenever we come back to NYC, we will choose these place to stay. Thanxs Doti & Kerry for your friendship and inspired discussions. To meet you was one of our travel highlighths. The Müllers from Hamburg/Germany[QWERTY123]Doti is by far the most together host I could imagine.  She has literally thought of everything.  I loved my stay here...the comfortable bed, chill of air-conditioning on a hot summer night, and blackberries and coffee in the morning; what could be better? Oh yeah, how about an insane location and elevator to carry your bags up- Doti's place is the freakin' best in the city!!! Thanks so much, Doti!!!!![QWERTY123]Doti and Kerry are great hosts, full of good advices.  We have stayed at Doti's place for 5 days and we enjoyed it so much.  The location is perfect, central and a few blocks from 3 different lines of subway.  We could hardly get a better location.  The room was perfect and very clean.  The air-conditionned was very appreciated.  The breakfast was excellent and very diversified: coffee or tea, bagels, cream cheese (3 different flavors), cereals (granola), yogourt and fresh fruits.  On our first day, one of us asked for orange juice and toasts.  As this was missing, Doti proposed to go right away to buy some for us.  Guess what... on the second morning, there was orange juice and toasts for us...  she even proposed us to cook eggs as she thought we had not eaten enough.  Doti is always doing her best to accomodate people and help us planned our day.  A few times, she searched the internet to help us better plan our day and to provide information on shows going on.  This is extremely appreciated.  Thank you so much Doti and be sure that if we go back to NYC we will book your place again.   Louis et Michel.[QWERTY123]We had a lovely time in New York!Doti is an incredibly considerate host and her little room is all that we needed...a super super super comfy bed with crisp sheets and a sparkling clean bathroom...plus when we were not flying out the door to go do fun NYC stuff she would have fresh berries and coffe for us!THank you so much Doti for welcoming us into your perfect little Chelsea room!!![QWERTY123]My daughter and I had a great stay with Doti. I thought the bedroom was surprisingly quiet, even though the location of the appartment is very central. It is only a hop and a jump to anything in Manhatten. We were VERY thankful for the air condition unit, since it was quite hot during our stay. Being out and about during the (hot) days, we greatly appreciated a refreshing shower, the comfortable bed, and the coolness of the room at night. Breakfast was very tasty; and additionally Doti had insightful suggestions and tips to make our stay unique and more enjoyable. Thank you very much Doti, for providing such a great space and welcoming atmosphere. It was wonderful to meet you![QWERTY123]Doti is a great host, upbeat, erudite, generous with advice. She even had umbrellas to lend to travellers without the good sense to pack appropriately for NYC in August[QWERTY123]Doti was an excellent host. She helped us figure out walking/subway directions and made suggestions when asked. She also provided fresh bagels for breakfast and always had coffee/water on hand. Her apartment has an elevator. The room itself did not have a lot of street noise. Her place is super close to the FIT. I would stay with her again. I was a bit nervous because this was my first airbnb experience. Doti made it great.[QWERTY123]Doti was such a charming and wonderful host! It is true that she takes the deepest care in making sure you will enjoy the most of your stay, and that you have everything you need for your breakfast! Her apartment is strategically located in Manhattan. It was a great place for our short stay and by the end of it we felt that Doti had not only became our host but our friend.[QWERTY123]We couldn't wish for a better place or a better host than Doti. We stayed for 5 days at Chelsea Perfect and it was just PERFECT. A beautiful and comfortable bedroom, amazing breakfast with fresh blackberries and raspberries and caring Doti who went out of her way to assist us with checking out and making online travel bookings and provided with great recomendations on places to see in NYC. We'll definitely stay at Doti's again on our next visit in NYC[QWERTY123]Me and my boyfriend had a great 3 nights with Doti, perfect hostess! She is friendly and informative, the room is amazing and spacious, really central location, great breakfasts! Couldn't have been happier, thanks Doti![QWERTY123]Doti is a wonderful host! the small apartment is very nice, clean and full of books! and very well located in Chelsea. At our arrival we felt so welcome and even if we remained for a very short-break, we had a pleasant stay, with loverly breakfast and nice conversations.
Thank you Doti, see you soon![QWERTY123]I really enjoyed my stay at Doti's! She's a great host, very welcoming and the room has a super comfortable bed! Her place is perfectly located to visit all of NY; I definitely know where to go and stay again next time I'm in NY!![QWERTY123]The most gracious of hosts, informative, helpful and personable.  Great location.  Fabulously comfortable bed.  Great breakfasts and the home made whipping cream to go with the scones was to die for.[QWERTY123]Very helpful before arrival and during stay to  understand what to do in and how to get  around in NYC.  Location is ideal for travel to key places and events by taxi,  bus or subway.  Lots  of restaurants in area.  They are a warm and friendly couple.  Room was clean; bed was comfortable.  Breakfast was great and included  fruit.  Lots of  books and stimulating conversation.  We throughly enjoyed our stay.    Bob[QWERTY123]High expectations after reading the reviews, but this was even better than we thought. We were supposed to stay 4 nights, but ended up staying one more night, and could easily have stayed longer. Our new friend Doti is the perfect host, bed, bathroom, location, breakfast, everything with the apartment is great - and don't forget to check up her own blend of coffee![QWERTY123]I recently stayed with Doti for one week. My stay was very comfortable and the apartment is in a great location. All the other reviews are accurate, Doti is a great host. She is very perceptive to your needs whether it be recommending a local restaurant, offering her umbrella or researching directions for a particular destination.[QWERTY123]The perfect stay, the perfect host. The location is fantastic, the room beautiful and comfortable but most of all Doti was an kind, thoughful and obliging host. She went above and beyond for us. We would love to go back.[QWERTY123]A great location and a warm, friendly and helpful host![QWERTY123]A really warm and welcoming place. Doti and Kerry are very friendly and helpful hosts. Doti went out of her way to assist us with checking out and making online travel bookings and getting information about various NY attractions. Great breakfasts and such a comfortable bed. It was so special to have a homestay experience with locals who were so generous in sharing their knowledge, insights and time. Highly recommended, it put a human face on the Big Apple!![QWERTY123]Kerry is a great host, friendly and helpful. The apartment is super clean. Location is excellent, close to many metro stops and in a lovely neighborhood. Coffee with hazelnut for breakfast is a plus :)
Thank so much![QWERTY123]I can honestly say that I had the best time ever in New York much of which was down to staying with Doti and Kerry who were the most amazing hosts. I truly felt at home and the apartment and its location were incredible. Travelling to New York alone for a week I was somewhat apprehensive but Doti and Kerry made me so welcome and such a part of their family that my trip was wonderful. Doti and Kerry are incredibly knowledgeable about New York and where to go and what to see (Gotham Comedy Club is a must!)and the apartment is two streets (2 mins) away from 2 seperate subway lines making it easy to get anywhere in Manhatten, as well as close to amazing delis, cafes, restaurants etc. Chelsea Perfect is well....PERFECT and I cannot wait to go back! If you are thinking of going to New York then this should be the only place you consider staying.[QWERTY123]Doti was a wonderful host, providing us with a fantastic breakfast in a beautiful apartment in downtown Manhattan.
She also helped us plan our very short stay in New York giving us some great ideas for things to do and see.
We would definitely stay again when we come to New York again.[QWERTY123]We have just returned from a 5 night stay with Doti and Kerry in Chelsea, we had our own bedroom with the most comfortable double bed I have ever slept in, we arrived on Halloween and did find our first night noisy due to the partying and Halloween celebrations going on outside. Doti and Kerry are lovely people with big hearts, they welcome you to their home and the apartment is perfectly placed for most of the sight-seeing.[QWERTY123]i had one night with Doti and it was lovely, nice bedroom with interesting furniture.  Doti was very helpful and professional about my stay.[QWERTY123]We had a wonderful time at Doti's.  It was very convenient to F.I.T., the bed was very comfortable, and my husband especially enjoyed the conversation.  We would definitely stay with Doti in the future.[QWERTY123]Great spot and fantastic service.  Doti was cool as a cucumber.  I had a very trying day before arriving and was not displaying the most pleasant demeanor.  She wasn't phased, got me settled and comfortable and made the experience exactly what I needed.  I came from a hotel and this experience blew it away.  I slept great, had everything I needed and was offered help with some details that would have just been a hassle if I was at a hotel.  Strongly recommend.[QWERTY123]Thankyou very much Doti and Kerry for your wonderful hospitality.  We felt instantly at home in your home and loved our chats after our busy days sightseeing. All other reviews are accurate and say it all. We have no hesitation in recommending Chelsea Perfect to any prospective visitor/s.[QWERTY123]We had a lovely stay with Doti, and she was great with helping us with directions and places in the neighborhood to eat. Her breakfast was a real treat, and started off our days with warmth and cheer. Brian and Barbara[QWERTY123]I strongly recommend Chelsea Perfect!  Doti is a great host...she offers gracious hospitality while respecting privacy.  Her apartment is a warm, charming and welcome ""home"" in a prime location; the guest bed is superbly comfortable.  I especially appreciated the continual flow of coffee, the great advice on where to shop close by and the feeling that her goal was to make sure I was taken care of.  Chelsea Perfect is aptly named and I would recommend it to anyone.  -Paul[QWERTY123]We stayed with Doti for the thanksgiving holiday and can honestly say that the room was great and comfortable and Doti was very very welcoming and helpful in every way! We will be coming back to stay at Chelsea Perfect next time we visit New York again. Also we loved the location we were in walking distance to most places if not the subway was close by. Thank you Doti![QWERTY123]My daughter and I stayed with Doti and Kerry for four nights in mid December. They are lovely hosts whose comfortable apartment is within walking distance of all areas of lower Manhatten and midtown. Breakfast was delicious and the conversation great. Doti truly enjoys hosting guests in her apartment and in her city. I hope to be able to stay with her again.[QWERTY123]5 out of 5
We so enjoyed staying at Chelsea Perfect. Full marks go to Doti for being the perfect hostess. She is kind, sensitive, thoughtful and incredibly helpful. Our stay lasted 9 days; there was never a minute when we wished we were staying any-where else. The convenient location of Chelsea Perfect combined with the care we received from Doti, made for a wonderful vacation in New York. We both highly recommend Chelsea Perfect for your accommodation in New York.   
Peter and Pauline
[QWERTY123]Chelsea Perfect lives up to its name...great location and Doti is an impeccable host.  My fiancee and I stayed four nights, but even after the first night we felt like we were staying with friends.  Doti and her husband Kerry are warm, friendly and laid-back, and did everything they could to make sure our time in NYC was a good one.  We were so glad we chose Chelsea Perfect over some cheap hotel room.  Even The Plaza hotel can't offer the real, human experience that you will get at Chelsea Perfect.[QWERTY123]Believe the reviews! Doti,Kerry and the Chelsea Perfect were a wonderfully memorable experience. My daughter and I came away feeling like we had visited family. Our hosts were very attentive to our every need,whether we wanted to interact or have our privacy.Staying in an arty neighborhood with people who are representative of that community was a worthwhile experience[QWERTY123]Doti and Kerry were wonderful. This was our first trip to NYC and they made us feel comfortable and nothing was too much. We were able to ask for advice regarding the city and they were both so helpful. Their apartment is in an ideal location for all sights and shops in NYC and Times Sq is a stones throw away but without the noise on an evening. It is 5 minute walk from the subway and fantastic diners/restaurants/bars and coffee shops recommended to us by Doti. Breakfast every morning was delightful and the coffee, fresh bagels and conversation was the perfect way to start the day in a perfect city. The bedroom was spacious and the bed lovely and comfortable! Staying with Doti and Kerry gives you a true New York feel and they are fantastic people. Doti is the perfect host and I would recommend Chelsea perfect to anyone! We can't wait to return asap![QWERTY123]The place is well situated in the center of Manhattan, that means you get to almost anywhere walking. 20 minutes from Times square and the same at night to get back from the best jazz clubs our main interest. The appartment is not huge, the bathroom is shared, but Doti's comprehensive, smart and a sensible person. We felt some emotion leaving the place. Bill Evans played : ""We will meet again"" and we hope so (and Doti, as promised if you come to South of France I will lend you my scooter :-)[QWERTY123]We have had a great time at Doti's place. Her appartment is very nice and comfortable, located
in the centre of Manhattan. Apart from the famous sites one can visit in New York, and all the different touristic activities one can do, Doti's delicious breakfast (lots of fresh fruits, bagels, joghurt and cereals, coffe and tea..) definitely belongs to the things one just has to experience :-).

We won't forget Doti's hospitality, and if we came back to NYC one day, her place would be our first choice.[QWERTY123]Staying at Chelsea Perfect was a treat. The home is unique and immaculately kept. Breakfast was great, the bed was great, and the water pressure in the shower was great. Conversation with Doti and Kerry was a highlight. I would not hesitate to recommend this listing. My family and I feel as though we walked away with the perfect New York experience and new friends.
[QWERTY123]We had an excellent time at Doti and Kerry's apartment in Chelsea. She is a great host, made us feel welcome.  Also was very helpful in planning our day...she really went the extra mile. Thank-you so much, we had a wonderful vacation!![QWERTY123]I enjoyed my stay at Doti's place. We had interesting conversations while I enjoyed the delicious breakfast she prepared for me. And the location is fantastic![QWERTY123]This was our first time staying in a residential B&B. Doti was a great host and laid-out a great breakfast each morning (with many great choices). She is a great conversationalist and knows the area well. She also participated in my fiance's marriage proposal scheme!

The apartment is in a safe and VERY convenient area of the city. We had a really easy time getting to all of the places we wanted to see without taking any cabs (we walked or took the sub, which was 2 blocks away). The apartment is a one-bedroom/one-bath (the living room doubles as their bedroom at night) and felt a little tighter than what we expected from the pictures, but there was enough space to move around and it's probably typical for New York. If you're used to sleeping in quiet, bring some (Website hidden by Airbnb) usually wasn't a problem, but there was one night/morning when street noise got pretty loud (that's NYC).

I would consider staying here again on our next trip and would recommend her to our friends![QWERTY123]This was our first visit to both the USA and New York. Doti greeted us on arrival as though we were old friends and made us feel realy at home. We were very comfortable in the apartment and Doti’s breakfasts set us up for our days walking round the city. The location is ideally placed for travelling up or down town – and we can definitely recommend it![QWERTY123]We just returned from a four-day stay with Doti and have nothing but positive things to say about our experience.  Doti's apartment gave us a real taste of life in New York City.  Her neighborhood is artsy and fun, her place is unique and homey, and she is lovely and welcoming.  We slept like babies every night in the lovely bedroom (something we didn't expect in such a busy city).  The neighborhood was quiet at night and we felt safe walking the Chelsea streets whatever the time of day or evening.  The breakfast has been mentioned, but I will say again that it was a highlight of our visit.  On our last day she made fresh cream and got us scones, as well as the yogurt, bagels and fruit she provided every morning.  We would stay here again for sure.[QWERTY123]We couldn't have asked for a nicer situation:  clean room, very comfortable bed, wonderful breakfast, excellent location. Although we shared a small apartment with our hosts,Doti and Kerry, we felt as though we were visiting old friends. It would be difficult not to feel comfortable with them.  We relied on Doti for a number of suggestions, from restaurants to shopping, and her advice was perfect.  We'll be back.[QWERTY123]despite we have been in NY only one night, we loved staying in Doti's place. The room was very comfortable and Doti and Kerry have been so friendly and hospitable, so that we felt like at home. We really enjoyed our stay.[QWERTY123]What a perfect way to get to know New York – and a New Yorker family. We spend more than a week in Chelsea, at Doti and Kerrys place. Close to almost everything in Manhattan which was the first and main reason for our choice of staying. Well, the other reason was “the prize was right”, compared to hotel. But as both reasons were fulfilled, there was another reason that made our stay super, the host family. They gave us the best of breakfasts, gave us a lot of useful information about the town, searched the net for more information and made phonecall for tickets, and we shared some time with interesting talks about different things. We stayed three in the bedroom but never felt it was to small. Bathroom and shower, shared with the host family, worked out nice. This was a great way of staying in New York.

[QWERTY123]Great place and pleasant host. Thanks Doti[QWERTY123]We had a lovely stay at Chelsea Perfect. The assistance with the city was great adn the bed was cozy! Quiet but convenient![QWERTY123]Chelsea Perfect exceeded our expectations by a country mile. What a find! Doti runs a comfortable, clean, and well organized place in a great location, and she is a generous host. We wished we could have spent more time there on this trip, and we know where we'll aim for the next time. There's no need for hotels when something this good is available.[QWERTY123]After a long day of travel and emerging from Penn Station to the thrilling density of Manhattan, it was wonderful to be welcomed into Doti's home. She was extremely gracious and attentive. I actually enjoyed a dinner with her and her friend Johanna at a little Indian Restaurant around the corner. To arrive in a new city, and within a couple hours, be sitting down, enjoying a meal, and sharing ""what I love about living in New York"" stories with two locals is a rare treat. Her place was clean and comfortable (including the bed!) She and her husband Kerry were super sensitive to my needs, both for privacy and for assistance. A wonderful beginning to my stay in New York![QWERTY123]I just returned from New York after a weekend spent at Chelsea Perfect. Even before I arrived, I thought of Doti as a friend, due to her warm, concerned emails. I felt at home immediately. She provides everything a traveler could possibly need, including robes like those in fine hotels, use of a hairdryer, and current magazines about happenings in New York. She goes out of her way to prepare what you want for breakfast. I mentioned that I liked pineapple the first morning, and the next morning it magically appeared. Dot and her husband are very interesting people, and if you like books, as I do, you will be in heaven. They have the largest selection I have seen outside of a bookstore. I'm already looking forward to staying with them on my next trip to New York.[QWERTY123]From Doti's first warm greeting, I was completely at ease and felt like I was staying with friends. The bed was fantastic, so cozy and comfortable. The shower was great, and everything was provided (including the hair dryer!) The apartment is very well situated for going uptown or downtown, within 5 min of subway, 2 min of hailing a cab, 20 min walk to Times Square, and in a great neighborhood filled with food, arts, and great people watching.  AND, Macy's flagship 11 story store is 10 minutes walk!! The breakfasts were wonderful and made ""to order"", and Doti and Kerry are the most gracious hosts, there when you want to chat and invisible when you want privacy!!  Will definitely go back to visit. Thanks Doti.[QWERTY123]HAVE STAYED IN NEW YORK MANY TIMES BEFORE. ALWAYS AT A FINE HOTEL LIKE THE INTERCONTINENTAL, PLAZA, MARRIOTT,ETC. ,HOWEVER THIS WAS TO BE OUR MOST COMFORTABLE , ENJOYABLE STAY EVER. DOTI & KERRY ARE WONDERFUL HOST & HOSTESS , AND GO OUT OF THEIR WAY TO MAKE YOU COMFORTABLE.VERY, VERY, CLEAN ( WHICH IS VERY IMPORTANT TO US.) HAD THE BEST TIME EVER. VERY INTERESTING , CORDIAL PEOPLE.SITTING IN THE MORNING AND HAVING COFFEE , AND CONVERSATION WAS THE MOST ENJOYABLE TIME OF OUR DAY. BRILLIANT !!! A GENUINE PLEASURE TO BE AROUND. WILL NOT BE OUR LAST TRIP TO CHELSEA PERFECT ( THE GOOD LORD WILLING !!! ) BILL & CLAUDETTE- RHODE ISLAND[QWERTY123]We had a wonderful time at Doti's B&B.  Doti was delightful and her husband too!  She made us feel right at home.  Great location for cafe's, art, flea markets etc.  Doti gave us great ideas where to eat and shop.
We did luck out and was able to park on the street two blocks away.  Definitely would stay there again.[QWERTY123]My husband and I had a lovely stay at Doti's! Her home was clean, comfortable and quaint, in a perfect neighbourhood! I especially love all the books!! There was no curfew and Doti gave me the key as soon as I walked through the door! Would definitely recommend her place to others who are looking for a place to stay in NYC![QWERTY123]Staying (Website hidden by Airbnb) place was like staying with a friend, who you haven't known before. Our stay (Website hidden by Airbnb) contributed much, to make our first trip to New York City an unforgatable and very special one! You wanna feel like be part of the city? Stay (Website hidden by Airbnb) Great breakfast - we feeled very spoiled - great insider views and, what's the most important - we always felt welcome, and it was every night like going home. 
Sabrina and Giselda[QWERTY123]Doti and her husband are excellent hosts.  Right from the second Doti opened the door to us it felt as though we had arrived at the front door of old friends.  They made us feel so welcome.

The bed was incredibly comfortable, the bathroom spotless, the shower was powerful and the breakfasts were absolutely delicious.  Doti and her husband also went out of their way to ensure our stay with them and in New York was pleasurable, helping us to find nice restaurants and things to do etc.

We are so pleased we decided to stay here.  All I need to do now is persuade my boyfriend to go on another trip to New York soon so we can stay with Doti again!

Thanks a million Doti!  You are a star![QWERTY123]Doti and Kerry are wonderful hosts. The room was clean and comfortable andthe breakfasts are great. They are kind and interesting people who can converse on a wide range of subjects, but who also respect your privacy when you want.

In summary, a clean, comfortable room in a great location hosted by wonderful people.[QWERTY123]Chelsea Perfect bed and breakfast lived up to its fantastic reviews, it is perfect. Our stay in New York could not have been better, Doti and Kerry were excellent host and made sure our visit was enjoyable. They gave us not only clean comfortable accommodation and terrific breakfasts, they were also very helpful in directing us around the city. Location is great for everything, very central and close to subways. Can not speak highly enough of the overall experience. John & Helene from Australia down under[QWERTY123]They were both very friendly and helpful.  Their appt was very charming as well.  I would go back to their place next time when I came to visit.[QWERTY123]If you can, don't come to New York without staying at Chelsea Perfect! Doti and Kerry are very special people. Their home is warm and inviting. Breakfast was splendid, the bed was exceptionally comfortable. We felt we had visited with really good friends. We'll be back.[QWERTY123]Doti was thoughtful, kind, and helpful.  My two girls and I enjoyed our stay very much.  Thank you, Doti.[QWERTY123]My partner and I had a great stay at Doti's.  She was very warm and welcoming, and eager to help us plan our New York adventure.  The room was spacious, the bed comfortable, and as we arrived during a heat wave, we were very grateful for the air-conditioning! She also provides the most amazing breakfasts - muesli, fresh berries, yoghurt, chocolate croissants, bagels, coffee etc! Thanks for being a great host Doti, we would love to stay with you again.[QWERTY123]Thanks Doti so much for your hospitality. You made me feel very welcome and comfortable in your home.[QWERTY123]Doti was the best hostess and has the perfect place to rent in NYC. This was third time to NYC, but first time staying in Chelsea. We fell in love with Chelsea and are considering moving halfway across country to live there. Doti let us check in early,store our bags in the apartment, and offered us tea and coffee while the room was still in use by the previous guests. She was extremely helpful with recommendations, transportation tips, and was very detailed oriented. 

If you're looking for a safe, great location, and warm place to stay, this is the place. Oh, and did I mention affordable? Doti loves to travel- and so do we, so for any savvy traveler, this is the place to be.[QWERTY123]Staying with Doti was staying like staying with a family friend. From the moment she opened the door my daughter and I felt welcomed and we instantly felt comfortable..Doti was very hospitable, her breakfast were yummy with lots of selections of muselis, fruit, bagels and eggs. Brewed coffee was always available. 
The bed was so comfortable and clean. Everything was perfect . Staying with Doti was better than staying at a hotel because it was much more personal. Highly recommend staying at Chelsea Perfect. Location was great, easy access to subways and walking distance to everything. Will be definitely returning back to NY and to Chelsea Perfect.[QWERTY123]We had a great time, Doti knows how to perfectly balance casual and efficient. We always felt well attended to without being intruded on. The breakfasts were great.

We had some great conversations in between excursions into the city from her perfect location.

This stay sold me on both Doti's place (which we plan to go back to) and airbnb.[QWERTY123]We really enjoyed our stay at Chelsey Perfect. The apartment was nice and the hosts were friendly and helpful. Great breakfast with fresh fruits and good coffee. Quiet street and great location. We highly recommend it![QWERTY123]My mother and I felt completely comfortable at Doti's.  She and her husband were very welcoming and friendly.  We really enjoyed meeting her and found many things to talk about.  We are so happy to have stayed there, it was one of our highlights of our visit to NYC! After being there myself, I believe all the many, many wonderful reviews to be true.

[QWERTY123]Doti is a gracious hostess. Her place may be small but its warm and welcoming. Very comfortable bed and a delicious breakfast. My husband and I loved staying in Chelsea. There is so much to see and do within walking distance. Much better than a hotel. Hope we meet again.


















[QWERTY123]Doti was very welcoming and accommodating.  The room was very comfortable, with antique furniture and a good mattress.   Doti asked what I wanted for breakfast and at what time, which I did not expect.   She is a good conversationalist and made me feel like I was staying at a friend's apartment.[QWERTY123]Like seemingly every other person who has stayed at Doti's I had a fantastic experience!

She is the prefect hostess - welcoming, considerate and gracious and the room was very comfortable. The location is quiet and very well located, close to several subway lines and very good restaurants.

I know where I'll be staying the next time I'm in New York![QWERTY123]Doti was great, very hospitable, the room a little smaller and busier than I expected (the apartment has a lot of stuff), but all in a fine room for the night.[QWERTY123]We had a wonderful stay with Doti and felt we were leaving a friend when we departed.  We enjoyed the friendly and helpful atmosphere created by Doti and her husband and would love to stay there again.[QWERTY123]The room was clean, well decorated with a comfortable double bed, well lightred, with a window facing the street.  The bathroom, which is just adjacent, is kept clean tidy and well equipped with all essentials.  The apartment is filled with books that seem to occupy much of the space.  They cover a wide variety of subjects, if one has the time and inclination.   Doti enjoys being a hostess and has an interest in her guests. If I should need accomodations on my next visit to NYC I wouldn't hesistate to stay in her apartment in Chelsea.

AM[QWERTY123]My husband and I enjoyed our time with Doti, what a wonderful person to open her home to travellers! Location was terrific, we were able to walk everywhere, just fantastic!![QWERTY123]Our stay at Chelsea Perfect, was ....just perfect! A bit compact, but with a very warm welcoming from ""Doti"". When we were there she was having a new carpet installed in her living room which ""messed up a bit"", else the stay was very nice. The breakfast that was served was very to our liking, fresh fruit, bread, egg and ham if you wished.
""Doti"" also helped out to book tickets for a jazz concert and also for our bus tour to Washington. Thank you![QWERTY123]Definitely the best thing about our trip to New York was staying with Doti! She's a great hostess with whom you'll want to spend a great deal of time just talking and getting to know each other.

She was essential in our day to day planning and in helping us get the most out of our trip.

The room is great! Very clean, spacious and with a lot of privacy. And the location of the apartment is incredible. A very short walk to pretty much anywhere you want to go. And if you want to take the subway, there are 3 stops really really close by.

Seriously, there's no reason why not to stay with Doti!

[QWERTY123]Staying at Chelsea Perfect was a great insight to apartment living in New York.  It is amazing what can be fitted in to a relatively small space! Doti made us very welcome and is very knowledgeable about all aspects of the city, including things to do and recommending very good restaurants, even addresses for knitting shops. Although we only stayed for two nights we had some good conversations and found out a bit more of what the “real” America is like. Thanks again – and you are welcome in Amport any time.[QWERTY123]Doti is such a nice person, extremely helpful and kind, and I had som really nice conversations with Doti in the evenings of my stay with her. The apartment is perfectly located and even though the place is filled with books and furniture, the room and apartment is clean and cosy. I warmly recommend her personal and friendly place.[QWERTY123]Doti was a warm and gracious host. Her small apartment is in a nice neighborhood, and close to everything we wanted to do. The guest room and shared bath were comfortable and very clean; we both slept well, which we usually have a difficult time with in New York. The experience really was like staying with a friend in the city.[QWERTY123]Chelsea perfect.... I couldn't think of a more apt name! We had a wonderful time staying with Doti, she is so warm, kind and inviting, we felt so at home in her lovely flat. The bedroom is spacious and the bed is really cosy. Breakfast is delicious, you couldn't ask for more. Doti is a font of information and what she doesn't know she's eager to find out for you. Thanks Doti for making our stay so special, I hope to be able to visit you again soon xox[QWERTY123]We were really comfortable at Dotti's home. Both her and her husband made us feel welcome. We especially enjoyed the flexibility of coming and leaving as we were exploring NYC. The breakfasts were delicious. We would definately stay again with them.[QWERTY123]Doti's apartment is warm and cosy and is the ideal base for me to start my adventure in NYC! Two different subway stations running five different lines are just a 5 minute walk from her place, giving one easy access to both uptown and downtown. There are also plently of things to do+see+eat around her neighbourhood... Chelsea market (for really good coffee @ 9th St Espresso, sandwiches @ Hale and Hearty, cakes, cookies.. and a couple of seafood markets), Billy's cupcakes, Whole Foods market (which is just round the corner from her place and is an excellent spot to buy groceries. I love the salad bars here!), and not too far off is Madison Sq Park (Shake Shack burger!! A must GO!). I was also able to walk further down to 5th Ave and Union Sq where there's a lot of shopping to be done. Most of the mid-brands that you find in mid-town can be found here as well.

Doti is a very warm and friendly person, who offered me a lot of suggestions on what to do, where to go and how to get there. She never hesitates to log on her computer to help me check out information of places, and even found out what is the luggage weight limit for my airline. Since I was traveling alone, it was a huge plus to come back in the evening to a friendly face and shared how my day went. Doti's place is clean and tidy, even though she has a big collection of books. The room I stayed in is big, the bed is comfortable, towels are provided and there's also a dresser to store my clothes. I would definitely stay with her again![QWERTY123]our stay with Doti and terry was perfect we felt cared for and the room was just fine , the Cuban restaurant was good too we will surly return Dave and Jan[QWERTY123]Absolutely the nicest stay I've ever had. Wonderful place and wonderful people. Doti even got me a cake for my birthday! The place and the location are great as well.[QWERTY123]Our stay was wonderful, Kerri took great care of us as Doti was away. We felt right at home and very welcome. We wish Doti all the very best![QWERTY123]What a lovely stay in New York!  Doti herself was away but her husband, Kerry, was a brilliant stand-in host and went beyond the call of duty to ensure I had a really comfortable, relaxed and easy time staying in their extremely welcoming home. The best part of each day was the time Kerry took to chat and answer my questions over copious quantities of toast and scrambled eggs, and excellent coffee from the brilliant old-style coffee percolator.  I really valued the privacy of the room I stayed in, and the fact it looked out over a really beautiful tree which was in full flower, and the tranquility of the street below - yes, it really WAS New York! - meant that I slept like a log, totally undisturbed.  What heaven!  The sense of security and comfort, combined with the convenience of having keys so you can pop back to the flat whenever you need, but most importantly being just a minute away from a really useful subway station, loads of busses, and even an easy walk to key attractions in the middle of Manhattan, meant that I felt incredibly lucky to be staying at Chelsea Perfect.  I can thoroughly recommend staying there!  It made my holiday and it'll make yours.[QWERTY123]Perfect location in a quiet area of the busy NYC; just a few step from the metro station, times square and many shops & restaurants.
The appartment is quite small but a cosy bedroom in brittish style will welcome you.
And you will appreciate the trully organic breakfast made just for you.
[QWERTY123]Great location.
Comfortable bedroom.
Amazing breakfast.
But the most important is the human quality of our hosts: Dothy and Kerry are great persons, she has a fine sense of humor, and they are both the kindest people!!!
Staying at Chelsea perfect was indeed a one of the most important reasons we had to enjoy New York so much.
We feel we have found a couple of very good friends.[QWERTY123]Doti and Kerry are wonderful hosts. Fun, intelligent, easygoing - they made our recent NYC visit a delight. Breakfast is great, conversation stimulating, the bed comfortable and the location perfect. I cannot recommend them highly enough, and I'm sure we will see them again in the near future. Thanks guys! Robbie & Nicky.[QWERTY123]thanks doti

i had a great time staying at doti's.  she is lovely, intelligent, kind, great hostess, there if you want to chat, not there if you want quiet, knows the city as only one who was not born there can do, bed was extremely comfortable, breakfast was just like at home, location was great, i will return.

[QWERTY123]My wife and I enjoyed staying with Doti while attending a workshop in Chelsea at the beginning of June.  This was by far a superior experience than staying in a hotel.  The location of Doti's apartment can't be beat; right in the heart of Chelsea, close to the subways, the Village, and the Piers.  Doti provided us with a very comfortable bedroom and plenty of privacy; breakfast and coffee in the morning was a plus!  Doti and her husband were great to visit with and provided helpful hints on navigating the city.  The overall experience was a ""5"" and we wouldn't hesitate to stay with her again!  John and Araceli, Boulder, CO.[QWERTY123]doti was a wonderful hostess[QWERTY123]Doti and her husband Kerry have been truly geat hosts! Good room, great location and a nice breakfast! Absolutely recommended![QWERTY123]Doti is a wonderful host!  We really felt safe and at home.  She was very helpful and knowledgeable about New York City.  Her place was in a great location because we were taking classes at FIT.  We loved our 3 week stay there and had so much fun!
[QWERTY123]I read the reviews before booking and we are very pleased to say that Doti and Kerry lived up to them.  They are fantastic hosts and you quickly feel welcomed as part of their fanily.  We spent 12 nights with them and always felt welcome, no matter what the time was  when we arrived in!  Breakfast provided a great start to the day and we would often chat with Doti and Kerry, forgetting the time.  They are a font of knowledge and our chats covered many subjects including where to go for a great meal.
All in all a wonderful stay and if we go back there is only one place for us to stay..........Dot (Phone number hidden by Airbnb) s[QWERTY123]My daughter and I enjoyed our three weeks staying with Doti, who was a wonderful host (as was her husband) and very attentive to our needs. She researched and suggested activities for us, helped us figure out how to get around and indulged us in our favourite things for breakfast. All this in spite of having some difficult family issues to deal with at the time. Doti and Kerry's small and pleasantly cluttered apartment is in a convenient location for exploring Manhattan. The bedroom, well endowed with furniture and possessions, was comfortable, especially the bed, and very private. Doti is a warm and generous person, and I enjoyed her company and having a chat and a laugh with her. Thanks Doti, I hope to see you again sometime.[QWERTY123]Doti is a fantastic host and her lovely apartment is in a great location.  So glad we stayed there![QWERTY123]Doti‘s place was the greatest choice for our first NY trip and in fact it will be our choice for the next time as well. Hospitality could not be better: warm NY bagels and cream cheese was perfect for breakfast plus there was lots of fresh fruit, cereals and more...... all kind of useful tips to go around and survive in the city that never sleeps, perfectly clean, and more importantly the sympathy of a smily good morning from our hosts made us feel home.

For that reason we say:  NYC is ""aka"" Doti‘s place!!! 

We loved it!!!! 

and always remember: Lets go Mets!!! :)))))[QWERTY123]Doti was a great host! She made us feel very welcome during our stay in NYC.[QWERTY123]Doti est une personne énormément sympathique et avenante. Elle nous servait des petits déjeuners délicieux, variés et copieux, était toujours à l'écoute de nos souhaits. Elle souhaitait également nous aider ou nous conseiller pour nos visites dans NY mais comme nous ne maitrisons pas bien l'anglais, ce ne fut pas aisé. Le lit est super confortable et nous avons  à chaque fois bien dormi.  En outre, l'appartement est super bien situé, dans un chouette quartier, très près du métro et pas loin du centre. Bref, allez-y et vous ne le regretterez pas.
Françoise et JP

[QWERTY123]Thank you Doti and hubby for being such great hosts! It was such a pleasure to meet you, and to spend some time in your cozy Chelsea home. We're already dreaming about our next (and longer!) trip to NYC, and looking forward to returning to your place. Thanks again for providing such a warm and hospitable welcome![QWERTY123]Very convenient location, good and clean facilities.[QWERTY123]Doti and Kerry are great hosts. They were adorable with us, taking time to answer our questions, help plan our day... We enjoyed our long chats in the evenings with them. 
The flat was comfortable. It is just minutes away from major metro lines, supermarkets, delis, coffee shops... So very practical. 
Breakfast was super, our favorite were the bagels with rich strawberry flavored cream cheese spread. :-) 
Watch out for the bed. It was a little too comfortable. Prime culprit for late starts to most of our days :-) Be sure to have an alarm clock handy.
If you forget to bring along a book to read. No worries. The flat is literally a library (for books in English). Doti also provides you with the latest magazines with info on what's happening in town. 
Great stay. Thank you Doti & Kerry for the warm welcome.

[QWERTY123]Doti is a very pleasant and attentive host. Apartment is cosy and has extremely convenient location. Superb breakfast, clean facilities. An overall excellent experience. Highly recommended.[QWERTY123]Marvelous visit with Doti in Chelsea. Bedroom was lovely and comfortable. Doti went way out of her way to get my preferred foods for breakfast and kept me company while I ate. Many magazines and other resources about the city were available and Doti spent a great deal of time gathering information online for me about things I wanted to do, plus helping me get tickets. A great visit![QWERTY123]Die Unterkunft von Doti im Chelsea Viertel ist sehr gut gelegen, man braucht nur wenige Gehminuten zu verschiedenen U-Bahn Stationen. Ebenfalls in nächster Nähe hat es verschiedene Restaurants, in welchen man hervorragend essen kann.
Der Aufenthalt (7 Nächte) bei Doti haben wir sehr genossen. Sie war sehr nett und hilfsbereit und war sehr bemüht mit uns zusammen, den Aufenthalt in New York so interssant und abwechslungsreich zu gestalten. Die Unterkunft war sauber und zweckmässig. Das Bad, welches wir mit Doti teilten, konnten wir zu jeder Tages- und Nachtzeit frei benutzen und es gab keine Konflikte. 
Wir können Doti nur weiterempfehlen.
[QWERTY123]It was a wonderful stay at Doti's and Kerry's place in Chelsea! They have a cosy apartment, which is located in the very center in Manhattan, close to everything you want to see in Manhattan. Also the underground is right around the corner. The room was very comfortable, the bathroom as well and Kerry made us a fantastic breakfast every day including fresh fruit, bagels or cereals. But the best thing was, that Kerry gave us helpful tips what to do in NY! Thank you so much Kerry and Doti, when we visit NY again, we definitely come to your place again![QWERTY123]We had a great time with Doti in Chelsea. She was a terrific hostess. The breakfast was fantastic especially the fresh fruit platter. She would make anything you want for breakfast. The bedroom and bathroom were spacious and the bed was super comfortable. We enjoyed our chats with Doti during breakfast and at times in the evening. Doti was very helpful with tips on sightseeing and how to get around Manhattan. Her apartment is in a great location as there are many restaurants and shops. It is in walking distance to Highline, Penn Station and the Meatpacker district. Thanks Doti for a great stay![QWERTY123]A very comfortable room and a thoughtful, gracious host. For a NYC room rental, this is as good as it gets![QWERTY123]I stayed with Doti this past weekeend and at first I was a little nervous because it was my first time trying out air bnb but she is so sweet! Very accommodating for whatever your needs are. She lives in a great area of the city and subways are accessible all around. Not too far from Times Square and other touristy parts of the city. 

I stayed with two other girls, it was a little cramped for 3 because the air bed took up a bit of room but we managed. Overall the room and apartment is clean.  Doti is a great host and I'm sure you will enjoy your stay![QWERTY123]I really couldn't have asked for more from our experience staying with Doti.  My friend and I were treated with such affability, graciousness, and generosity of spirit.  The apartment and accomodations are cozy, ecclectic, and delightful - an incredible way to stay in NYC.  Its location is truly convenient to everywhere.  The metro is steps away.  The surrounding neighborhood has much to offer.  Doti was most helpful in assisting us with ideas of where to visit and how best to get around.  Doti helped us shape a most memorable and meaningful visit to NYC.  Thank you!!![QWERTY123]Chelsea Perfect, c'est un accueil chaleureux, par Doti, au coeur de Chelsea, a proximité de toutes les lignes de Métro et pour profiter au maximum de tout ce qu'offre Manhattan, même à pied.
Doti vous accueille dans son appartement où elle vous offre une chambre agréable (et propre), doté d'un lit confortable (indispensable pour vous remettre de vos ballades éreintantes), une salle de bain immaculée et qui brille!
Au petit déjeuner, une extraordinaire salade de fruit et tout ce que vous préférez, il suffit de demander. Doti prépare le petit déjeuner dont vous aviez révé pour nourrir les efforts nécessaires à votre escapade dans NYC.
En plus d'être chaleureuse, Doti est sympathique et cultivée. Alors au programme vous aurez sûrement des conversations fort intéressantes!

[QWERTY123]My  husband and I  spent four nights at Doti's. She is a warm, relaxed and thoughtful host.

 The breakfasts she provided were abundant and  delicious,  and were tailored to our eating habits.

The bed was comfortable and the bedroom had its own TV and WiFi access.   Doti placed chocolates in our room!   When our friend arrived in NY,  Doti  was able to accommodate her  in the bedroom on an  air mattress for two nights. The room became very tight, but we all managed just fine.

The flat is colorful , over stuffed and cozy.

The location seemed safe and was convenient for walking to the Empire State building and the metro.  It's two block from Trader Joes and Whole foods if you are too tired for restaurants in the evening.

We appreciated extra little efforts Doti was prone to making, such as helping us bring our luggage down to the waiting taxi when we left and fixing us a cup of tea when we had jet lag. Thanks Doti!

[QWERTY123]Doti is a very ncie person and always trying to accommodate for whatever your needs are. But she is extramely allergic to (Website hidden by Airbnb) if you wanna cook or eat any scallops. That's impossible. Anyway. My boyfriend and I had a great time with Doti. Her breakfast was amazing. Generally, It's a good place and location to stay and very convenience to take a subway or ride a bus. Especially it's very easy to take an taxi around her place. You know It's very hard sometimes to get a taxi in Mahattan in rush hours:) For a Mahattan room rental. It's a wonderful place to stay!
[QWERTY123]Doti is a wonderful person and made our stay feel like home. She made us breakfast, made our beds, and even did our laundry for all 3 of us. When we came home from sightseeing, we have warm and nicely folded laundry on the bed. It was not something we expect of her, but she did it graciously. We have good conversations in the mornings and we appreciate the little things she did for us, like leaving chocolates out for us in our room. The house is absolutely clean, the room is comfortable for 3 people, and we loved the large screen TV with cable in the room to come back to after a long day. 

On our last day, she waited with us for the taxi and gave us all a good bye hug. We made a friend here in NYC. This isn't just another airbnb room![QWERTY123]Our experience was extremely pleasant - the host were very
gracious and willing to help in suggesting possible restaurants or tourist
attractions.  Could not have been more accomodating.
[QWERTY123]We had a wonderful time in the apartment of Doti. She made us feel very welcome and gave us a tasty/healthy breakfast with a lot of fresh fruit every day. Doti told us a lot about living in New York. The apartment is not noisy, the bed was very comfortable which gave us a good night sleep! It's seated in the centre of NYC and all the highlights are easy to reach. 
[QWERTY123]I read the reviews before booking and we are very pleased to say that Doti and Kerry lived up to them. They are fantastic hosts and you quickly feel welcomed as part of their family. We spent 5 nights with them and always felt welcome, no matter what the time was when we arrived in! Breakfast provided a great start to the day. They only got 4 stars because the storm Sandy make us without power in 4 days.They make you feel comfortable  in the town, always ready to help you to get any plays. Doti and Kerry we will be back. Thanks for your hospitality.[QWERTY123]SHOCKING describes best the place, beginning with the odor the moment you walk in, the narrow hallway, where you have to walk sideways, the clutter, and more clutter in every room, etc. But that's not enough, this is a one bedroom and one bathroom apt. and the hosts sleep in the living room with curtains, which they close at night. The bathroom is shared, I never expected this. The picture is true to the place when cleaned up. However, t doesn't show the clutter on the wall opposite the bed, and it wasn't cleared of the clutter everywhere. DO NOT BELIEVE THE PICTURE. I HAVE THE REAL ONES AND THEY ARE SHOCKING. A bare third world place is more comfortable than this. I came home one afternoon to shower before the evening and found that clothes were drying over the bath tub, so no shower. I hate to give such a review because the hosts were accommodating, but I feel it my obligation to be honest. We had no room for suitcases, everything went on the floor, a few clothes were hung on a hook over the door. I never expected the hosts' would use the guests' room to store their own stuff upon stuff in every corner and on much of the floor of their apt. 

The building itself needed better housekeeping and upgrading, the location was convenient. So sorry that I can't recommend this place under any circumstances. If you doubt me, I took pictures because words can't describe the condition of this place.[QWERTY123]I can just agree with the other guests, perfect location, perfect hosts, perfect breakfast![QWERTY123]Doti was very nice in renting the room to me at the last minute. I had a sudden cancelation with my hotel accommodations. 

Although my stay was short she made it more than memorable. Her place was just as advertised; and extremely warm, cozy, comfortable and friendly. The room and apartment were very clean and well maintained, with the most comfortable bed I've ever slept on. The apartment is cozy and eclectic. There was unlimited hot water and the long hot shower was quite fantastic at the end of a long and harrowing travel experience. 

The location is great. Access to the trains, museums, shops and restaurants were all within a few blocks - easy reach. As well as Time Square and Broadway being about a three minute subway ride away – and where my meetings were. I had no problem in finding my way with her maps and directions.

She and her husband were very kind and attentive. I arrived at the apartment late with a weeks’ worth of dirty laundry and they insisted on taking care of it for me so that I could relax and still have fresh clothes for the next morning and before leaving on the next leg of my trip. Their attention to the detail of my needs made my trip much less stressful and ultimately more successful. I can’t imagine how I would have been able to handle the meetings I had to engage in the next day if they hadn’t taken me in and taken the time and interest to take care of me as they did. 

Sandy had left me on the road for nearly two weeks, my schedule a wreck and me emotionally bent! Chelsea Perfect was a soothing respite. I can’t say enough about a stranger who would take me in and do so much. I was sorry not to be able to stay longer to enjoy it, rest and recover and to assist in the recovering city. 

Chelsea and Chelsea Perfect are my headings when I am back in NYC! Who wants a hotel when you can have this; which is so much more?
[QWERTY123]Whenever I come to New York City I stay with Dot. So I have been using her Bed & Breakfast already 7 or 8 times in the past couple of years and it is always exciting, and feels so much like “comforting cozy home” that I do not want to leave. In fact it has been my home for 2 months when I did an internship at the United Nations in 2010 and I can say that staying with a host for that long is really the acid test for an accommodation and a friendship. What can I say? I always return with excited anticipation.

There are so many things I love about Dot and her apartment that I am afraid the space provided here will not suffice to share all of them. First, Dot is a wonderful, warm, comforting person. She goes above and beyond to make her guests feel welcome and is extremely considerate, respectful, and accommodating. You can ask her for everything and she will try to get it, find out about it, and organize it for you instantly. 

Dot is also really flexible. There were times when I poured my heart out to her, and there were times when I wanted to be left alone, there were times when I asked her for professional advice, and there where times when we laughed together and had fun. “Everything goes” with Dot. 

For NYC the apartment is pretty spacious, and Dot is respectful of personal space So much so that most of the times it feels like you have the apartment to yourself, even though she is there, working quietly from her couch, yet always approachable for questions and concerns. 

The apartment is truly beautiful and comforting. Dot has worked creatively in many areas and you can experience her sense for art, interior, antiques and decoration in every season. Since I have been there many times I am always looking forward to novel ideas decorative arrangements she composes. Among colorful accents, yesterday it was an arrangement of fresh flowers and herbs that gave a natural, fresh, and festive scent to the place – I loved it!

Speaking of natural – Dot will always provide you with organic foods. She takes great interest in green living (which as European I appreciate) and sustainable, clean food. She goes to any lengths to provide you with organic fresh fruit, fresh bagels, and loads of other organic delights to your liking (she really gets up at 5AM to get these things fresh daily!) that come beautifully arranged and decorated on your breakfast table. Also, her coffee and teas are organic, yummy!  

Truly, I am picky about my living space because it is an important “home base” wherever I am and I need personal space and sometimes a guide or friend. If you are looking for comfort, peace, nourishment, and easy-going communication, book with Dot. I guarantee you a great experience and a “spa” for your body, mind, and soul. I LOVE DOTI. 

[QWERTY123]Very easy stay, very helpful, everything clean and Doti made sure i had everything i needed. Very nice stay. 5 stars.
[QWERTY123]Dot definitely came through on her promise -- this WAS the perfect storm retreat. When I stayed with Dot at her ultra-cozy Chelsea space, I was going into my third week of being displaced from the storm. After spending many a night on friends' couches (eight in total), I was looking for a warm bed with a little personal space where I could recoup. I couldn't have been more happy with what I found. Firstly, the bed is amazing. I haven't fell that fast asleep in a long time. In the room, there is a gas fireplace and cable TV -- a real treat! Dot also has chocolates on the side-table and lush bathrobes on the door, plus all the bathroom necessities. What's more, Dot & her husband Kerry are a sweet, sweet couple. I very much enjoyed chatting with them about books (their walls are lined with them for you to read!) over a delicious organic breakfast the next morning. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND![QWERTY123]I am so happy that I chose to try out airbnb and that selected Clelsea Perfect for my stay in New York.  
The location is great.  Close to so many things and near my meeting.
I love the atmosphere at Doti's.  It is like a charming friendly Inn and yet you are in the city.  Doti and Kerry were great hosts.  They were respectful of my work needs and helpful with information about the area and local activities.  I felt so comfortable visiting with them.  I feel like I have two new friends.
I am very picky about cleanliness, especially in the bathroom.  The room and bathroom were immaculate.  The bed was cozy and the bedroom has a little electric fireplace to give it a comfy feeling.  I wish I could have stayed in bed and read a book but I had to get to business.  Maybe next time.
Now, the best part.  You will not get a fresh, organic and healthy breakfast like this anywhere I know of.  It was delightful to enjoy fresh berries and scones and chat with Doti.  And the coffee is great!
I gave this listing the highest rating because of the location, the hosts, the lovely clean accommodations, the atmosphere and the delicious breakfast.  All round it was a great stay.  I plan to return soon but to add in additional time to enjoy Clelsea Perfect and my new friends, Doti and Kerry.
I recommend that you try this airbnb.  You will not be disappointed.
[QWERTY123]Doti's place was just as described -- a very large, comfortable room in a lovely neighborhood.  Doti and her husband were very kind and prepared us delicious healthy breakfasts every morning (fruit, yogurt, muesli -- just as we had requested!  She had emailed to ask us before what we would like.)  The place was incredibly clean and Doti was very attentive.  We would definitely stay here again -- highly recommended![QWERTY123]Doti was super accommodating and something even more difficult to come by these days – genuinely caring about our comfort and well being.  When we showed up late to our stated arrival time, she expressed concern for our getting a little lost on the way there! (This was a result of sleep deprivation - as her home is central and easy to find.)  I am an artist and I love eclectic things, reading, and Doti's home told many stories through the abundance of books, art, and other items around the apartment. If you prefer minimalism, this may not be the place for you. If you like an experience, would enjoy meeting caring New Yorkers (Doti and her husband were both kind and welcoming), and enjoy staying in a room that feels as though it was made up just for your comfort, then this is the place for you.  Doti and her daughter (who was visiting) also helped us to plan a few of our stops, and to get student tickets to the New York Philharmonic ($15 each instead of $150)!  Our short stay (2 days only!)  in New York would not have been nearly so marvelous had we not stayed with Doti at Chelsea Perfect.  I hope to return again, as I feel I have a new friend in New York!  I'm also inspired to redesign my own room to capture some of the cozy comfort that Doti's guest room had.  Extra bonus: Doti was always ready with a hot cup of coffee, she provided a lovely New York bagel breakfast and most importantly, a safe, super comforting environment to come home to on a fast paced trip to the city that never sleeps (but always sleeps in).[QWERTY123]Doti and her husband are wonderful hosts, and lovely people. A great place to stay, well located and very welcoming.[QWERTY123]Chelsea Perfect is wonderful, just as in the photo.  Beautiful antiques.  Doti is a perfect hostess.  Spotless and unblemished.  Highly recommended.[QWERTY123]We had a great stay in NYC.  The breakfast was wonderful and fueled us for the long days of exploring the city.  The water pressure in the shower was excellent, which is always appreciated. The location is excellent for using the subway(s) and plenty to see and do in Chelsea.[QWERTY123]Doti and Kerry are fantastic hosts, i will certainly visit again next time i am in NY....worth mentioning breakfast...sensational, including the fresh, still warm, bagels Kerry run down to buy!

thank you guys

Lonely Planet[QWERTY123]We stayed at Doti's for just one night and it was perfect. While Doti had a personal emergency and had to quickly skip town, her husband was present and was an excellent host. The room and the apartment are as comfortable as the her photos appear. The hosts maintain the ""B&B"" mentality, operating more of a bed and breakfast. Note for breakfast aficionados - the breakfast provided is of excellent quality. The apartment is within a few blocks of two metro stops and is in the heart of Chelsea. Staying here was a pleasure and we hope to visit again soon.[QWERTY123]I enjoyed staying in Doti's apartment.  Kerry was an excellent host and makes great coffee.  I wasn't able to sample the breakfast but I hope I can on a future visit.  The apartment is in a grfeat neighborhood and was very comfortable.  I would definitely stay here again.

Douglas[QWERTY123]Simply wonderful! This was our first time using airbnb and will definitely not be our last.
My girlfriend and I were in NYC for a December weekend and Chelsea Perfect was a fantastic base for our trip. Doti and Kerry are wonderful hosts. 
Doti was fantastic during the booking process, responding quickly to queries and providing lots of helpful information.
Although we did not get to meet Doti, her husband Kerry made sure we felt very welcome in their home and was extremely helpful and friendly, while at the same time giving us the space we needed to come and go as we please, etc.
Doti and Kerry have been doing this for a while, and it clearly shows with their incredible attention to detail and willingness to help with all aspects of our trip. It seemed like they had thought of everything. Kerry went to fetch us fresh bagels for breakfast, delicious!
The room is cozy, spacious, and the bed very comfortable, definitely as advertised.
Location is brilliant, within walking distance of SO much, and subway stations are mere minutes away, ready to whisk you to NYC destinations further afield.
Cannot recommend enough. We look forward to staying again during our next visit to Chelsea![QWERTY123]Was on my feet all day prior to fetching up at Doti's at 11:00 PM.  Easy to find the building, easy to get up to 4th floor apt.  Said hello, said goodnight, went to bed, fell asleep in maybe 20 seconds.  Woke at 6 the next day, enjoyed a truly outstanding cup of fresh-ground coffee with Kerry (Doti was away), and was out the door for the train.  Takeaways are:
1) Really comfortable bed.
2) Significant # of books to peruse on next visit
3) TV remotes work  - uncommon
4) Did I mention the coffee was exceptional[QWERTY123]My boyfriend and I enjoyed a really relaxing and comfortable time with Doti at the very start of the year.  Her apartment is warm, well-organised and nothing is too much trouble. Doti welcomed us with a lovely cuppa and a good chat (it was New Year's day and bitterly cold outside). She is a very warm and giving host who clearly enjoys meeting new guests from around the world. The bed was SUPER comfy too and the breakfast was out of this world. I'd definitely recommend her as a host. She's very experienced and knows what guests are looking for in a comfortable stay.[QWERTY123]Even though I stayed only two nights at Doti's place, it felt like entering another world. Chelsea Perfect is indeed the perfect name for her lovely place. I was overwhelmed when entering my room and if I didn't have to explore New York, I would have loved to just stay in that cosy bed by the beautiful fireplace. The location is also simply perfect - very close to the subway station, walking distance to Chelsea market or the Flatiron building, lots of great restaurants around.
Above all, Doti was a great and very welcoming and caring host. You can either decide to have your privacy in your cosy room or have very interesting conversations with Doti. Two perfect days at Chelsea Perfect![QWERTY123]
[QWERTY123]Doti is welcoming and accomodating, and truly wants to make your visit to the City enjoyable and your stay with her restful. You'll have an authentic NY experience, in a book-stuffed midtown apartment furnished with heirlooms.[QWERTY123]Thank you Doti for such a lovely visit to your place in Chelsea.  You made the trip to NYC even more special.  I wish we could have stayed all day talking.  
We slept great---the bed was so comfortable.  Breakfast was wonderful also  Thank you again and we will be back to see you soon!![QWERTY123]We had a great time staying at Chelsea Perfect! Doti was out of town, but Kerry was an excellent host. The location was amazing and they made our stay very comfortable. We would recommend Chelsea Perfect if you are in NYC.[QWERTY123]Accommodations were clean and comfortable.  We spent most of our time out on the town but when we were at the apartment Doti and Kerry were super hosts.  Very nice and helpful.  Many thanks to them for a pleasant visit.  Location is great.  We were able to walk to almost everything without too much trouble.  As vegans, we were able to find plenty of places to eat in the area.  Doti and Kerry always had a nice breakfast option available for us as well.[QWERTY123]We my 15 year old daughter and I left cold and snowy Denmark in the middle of the night - to go to unknown NYC.
We ended up in a fantastic warm and welcoming place in the middle of what became our NYC. Chelsea.
Doti was so nice and had so much to give. It was like visiting family in a strange city. She would have answers to all kinds of questions.
She cooked whatever we wanted for breakfast. And that goes for the 15 years old as well. 
Different tea every morning - fresh fruit - bagels - etc.. it was great to be able to experience NYC every morning after breakfast.
She helped with reservations, she knew which places where close because of Sandy, before we came we mailed to have her help us with different things.
She was so interested and asked questions so that she was able to come up with ideas for us to try when we were there.
If she wasn't able to cook for us, Gary did or he pick up the best homebaked bread :-)
Hopefully we will be able to come back and stay, we weren´t finish with NYC when we left and we have tons to talk about with Doti and Gary.
Thank you for making our NYC trip so memorable.
Chelsea Perfect is the best place we could have been, so glad we found it.
[QWERTY123]Lovely room, gracious hostess, great area![QWERTY123]Doti is the perfect hostess and the location is great. The flat is  clean and bright, and though it's small we had a lot of privacy. The bedroom itself is roomy and very comfortable. There were nice touches like chocolates and flowers in the room, and a good full breakfast. We would definitely stay there again![QWERTY123]
Doti was a wonderfully gracious host.  The room was charming and the location excellent.   The subway, that got us everywhere, was so easy to access.  Couldn't have had a better time.[QWERTY123]Tell others in the Airbnb community about your stay.[QWERTY123]Awesome week in NYC!  Dot's place couldn't be better located for sojourns anywhere on the island.  Dot and Kerry were marvelous hosts........great breakfasts, tips for the day, AMD privacy to boot.  2 thumbs up all the way around![QWERTY123]It is no wonder that Doti and Kerry are #1hosts.  James and I stayed with them for 10 days and it was a joy. The room, the bed, the bath all perfect.  Breakfast was so much better than expected, they could not do enough to make our stay more than perfect.[QWERTY123]We had a great stay with Doti at Chelsea Perfect. Doti is a wonderful host who really goes the extra mile to insure your stay with her is the best it can be! The residence is a great set up with an ample sized room with King bed. The bathroom includes a shower with endless hot water with good pressure. Breakfasts are always as per your requests. All in all a great way to experience New York City and the charms of Chelsea. Highly recommended.[QWERTY123]Doti 's apartment is in a great part of Chelsea, very central to the subway, Highline walk and restaurants. Breakfast was delightful with plenty of choice and yummy berries. Thanks to Doti and her husband for looking after me so well.[QWERTY123]Doti and Kerry are lovely and friendly hosts. Chelsea Perfect is a great location for those wishing to see NY. It was close to the heart of the city (walking distance) and relatively quiet (for NY). Plenty of good restaurants nearby and all the amenities we needed for our stay. It was a little tiny, as I suspect most NY apartments are, but suitable for us.[QWERTY123]NA[QWERTY123]Chelsea Perfect is in the most perfect position.Chelsea is a great place to stay, - home to the Highline and the fabulous Chelsea Markets. I have trouble walking long distances but half a block down and you have a choice of restaurants and one block up and you have all the stores.Dorothy is a wonderful host and the bed was the most comfortable I had in my 3 week stay in the States.I had asked for a muesli and fruit breakfast and got such a selection that I found it hard to choose! I loved chatting to Doti. She's smart and interesting and talented. Wish I could have spent more time in her company! When I left I felt as though I had made a friend. If you enjoy the bed and breakfast experience when travelling, then you will certainly enjoy staying at Chelsea Perfect![QWERTY123]Doti and Kerry were such wonderful people to stay with and get to know!  The room and apartment are very comfortable and welcoming.  The place was very clean and fresh feeling and the bed was super comfy.  They do an excellent job providing travelers with all of the basic comforts and go above and beyond to provide delicious breakfasts, snacks, coffee, etc.  We will be looking them up next time we venture to NYC!  Also need to mention how helpful Doti was when I lost my cell phone!!  Thanks for helping me not panic!![QWERTY123]We really enjoyed our stay with Doti & Kerry. It was our first time in New York and they were so welcoming. Our room was clean and comfortable and we wanted for nothing. Doti was always on hand to ask advice and nothing was too much trouble. The apartment was in a very good location and convenient for everything. Although the weather turned very hot while we were staying, the apartment was always nice and cool to come back to.[QWERTY123]As a novice to the world if airbnb, I could have had a better experience than staying with Doti and Kerry. The room was very comfortable and quietly secluded from the rest of the apartment. Also, given that the location is right in the heart of Chelsea, I was pleasantly surprised with the relaxed neighborhood feel and quiet. Everything is literally at your doorstep, or at most a very short walk away (restaurants, services, access to any of a number of subway lines, the High Line and - of course - galleries). Breakfasts - complete with Murray's bagels - were a great way to start the day. My only reservation in recommending so highly, is that it will probably make it more difficult for me to book to stay again in the future ;-)[QWERTY123]The bed was extremely comfortable! Doti and Kerry are so nice and kind. The breakfast was so great. I would highly recommend Chelsea Perfect to people who want to stay in Manhattan![QWERTY123]We spent 5 nights with Dotti and Kerry at the beginning of September. Our stay was delightful and Dotti did everything she could to cover all our requirements and make our stay as enjoyable as possible. The neighborhood was great to walk around and the accommodation within easy walking distance of the subway, restaurants and shops. I would highly recommend staying at Chelsea Perfect[QWERTY123]My friend and I had a perfect stay with Doti and Kerry.
They were very helpfull in every way!
The breakfast was great, the room was very cosy and they gave us  all the touristic information we needed!
Thanks a lot!!!
Christel[QWERTY123]Had a fantastic time staying with Doti. The apartment is fantastic, the bed really comfortable, and the location right in the heart of the city.

I was in NYC for business, but would be just as happy staying here on a personal trip.

I would definitely stay again![QWERTY123]Great neighbourhood, great hosts, great value!
For our first trip to New York, we couldn't have booked a better place than Doti and Kerry's lovely bed and breakfast accommodation. Chelsea is lively but also a refuge from midtown bustle, and has good subway access. Doti and Kerry are kind and generous hosts, and Doti's breakfasts are delicious and tailored to what you want. They are always ready with useful info and advice about how to access the neighbourhood and the city's amazing resources. And the accommodation - a lovely bedroom with access to e rest of the apartment - and plentiful breakfast has to be one of the best value deals in town. Highly recommended for couples and singles.[QWERTY123]Doti's apartment is a cozy oasis in one of New York's most likeable neighborhoods.  Subways all around,  galleries just a few blocks away, plenty of fine places to eat, and a really comfortable bed to come home to at the end of a long day. 

A highly recommended, convivial host.
[QWERTY123]Chelsea Perfect was exactly that. Perfect! Fabulous location, with shops, restaurants, bars etc, all within a stones throw. Subway also close by, so all of NYC was within easy reach. Doti and Kerry were a delight, and we felt at home in an instant. The room was great and the bed very comfortable. Breakfast was fantastic. Nothing was too much trouble for Doti and she often went above and beyond 'the call of duty'. She even managed to secure tickets to a Broadway show for us that were five rows from the front. Thanks Doti and Kerry for making us feel so welcome, and for making our New York holiday the absolute best ever! 
Cheers,
Claudia and Tim :D[QWERTY123]The reservation was canceled 2 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.[QWERTY123]Doti est une très bonne hôte qui s'occupe de tous les détails importants et qui prépare un excellent petit déjeuner. L'endroit est très bien situé et est paisible, dans un quartier intéressant de New York. Le lit est confortable, mais un tout petit peu bruyant si vous êtes un couple. L'appartement n'est pas très grand, mais confortable et très propre. Je recommande sans hésiter cet endroit.[QWERTY123]It was fun talking to the host and the place was in a great area.[QWERTY123]Doti was very friendly and made me feel at home immediately.[QWERTY123]Stay with Doti has been an amazing experience. She is very concerned about your well-being and is always available to help you. We had great discussions and she gave us many good advices on the best things to do in NewYork. Furthermore, the room was really nice. We spent only two nights there but I would have love to stay longer if I could. If you're looking for a well located apartment and a wonderful host, ""Chelsea Perfect"" is without doubts a good choice.[QWERTY123]Doty is nice and helpfull. She is usually around. During the summer, the whole apartament is always confortable. The place is really well situated in Manhattan. Chelsea Perfect is a fair name for my experience! 
Doty é gentil e prestativa. Está geralmente presente e disposta a ajudar. Durante o verão, o apartamento todo esta sempre em temperatura agradavel. O lugar é muito bem situado em Manhattan. Chelsea Perfect é o nome justo pela experiência que vivi![QWERTY123]We had a perfect stay at the Chelsea Perfect! Doti was super accommodating and the sweetest hostess. Thank you for a memorable weekend!![QWERTY123]Super easy going with schedule changes and very helpful over all![QWERTY123]Had a great stay with Doti .. The moment I walked in I felt  very welcomed in her condo  ..had a  spacious room .. Great location and super easy to get to public transportation. Will definitely contact her when Im back in New York .  thanks for the great hospitality. ✨✨✨✨[QWERTY123]It was my first time using Airbnd and Doti was very helpful and informative.   Wasn't  sure what to expect, given that I'm very private person, but Dot made me and friend  feel at ease and at home. The place was beautiful w/ many antiques, which made it feel like a true country inn.  The room was spacious and exactly as you see in the pictures.  Breakfast was served in real china and she really put out a spread.  So if you want to feel like you are staying in a country inn  I highly recommend it.  I have found the place that I will be staying at when I come into the city to see my son.
Thank you -  Doti - It was a pleasure getting to know you.

Millie[QWERTY123]Doti is way more than you'd expect from an Airbnb host: she's extremely nice, super communicative, extremely interesting and very helpful and outgoing. Seriously, I cannot recommend her enough. A perfect choice[QWERTY123]Doti was an amazing host. The location of her apartment was ideal and she was extremely helpful. I really enjoyed the stay , thank you Doti![QWERTY123]Immediately after our first stay, we again stayed with Doti. 

And we knew what to expect: a warm, caring, intelligent and heart warming person that is Doti. When we left, we felt like it was our home - a place where you feel welcomed and protected. Doti, we love you :)[QWERTY123]I think it will be hard to top Chelsea Perfect, as it was exactly that. 

I highly recommend you stay here when visiting NYC. Doti was beyond accomodating she is kind, respectful and goes above and beyond in every way to make sure you enjoy your time in Manhattan. Nothing was ever too much trouble a great breakfast and coffee was always prepared for me when I woke up  (I felt very spoilt). 

 I feel like I have made a new friend from our wonderful chats over my week here. I also loved the hundreds of books that filled the apartment giving it a very home like feeling when getting home after long days of sight seeing. 

The room is huge by NY standards has great air conditioning if you are visiting in summer and you have complete privacy from the rest of the flat. The location is great and safe and I found it very easy to access the subway.  

If you are looking for a comfortable and well located place to stay with a lovely host then this is for you. I can't wait to come back (and I only left this morning) 

Thank you Doti, it was my pleasure to be able to share your home with you.[QWERTY123]This was the perfect stay! My bf and I were in town for a wedding. We usually stay with friends, but they've moved out of the city. Fortunately we were able to book Doti's amazing place. Her apartment is in Chelsea, very convenient to everything. We walked mostly, but could have easily gotten on various subway lines. There are too many restaurants  and shops to name in walking distance. It was vibrant, but not loud, and we always felt safe. The bedroom is much bigger than we though, and Doti has thought of everything even robes and slippers! And she provided breakfast every morning and was kind enough to serve us on our schedule. I'm not sure my review will do the stay justice, but it was excellent![QWERTY123]Doti was such a warm and gracious host, starting when we made our reservation. Her warmth and accommodating ways shine through every detail. 
We were arriving a bit early and staying beyond her normal policy, but with advance notice was very happy to accommodate our request to leave our bags with her. 
The bed was super comfy with great sheets, flowers in the room, every amenity provided and every need anticipated. 
Delicious, healthy breakfast and a wonderful connection with our host. 
The area is very engaging and full of a neighborhood vibe in the big city. 
Loved the location and loved our host!![QWERTY123]Doty is warm and welcoming.  We had wonderful conversations and she made me feel that her apartment was mine for the duration.[QWERTY123]We didn't know what to expect, but Doti was a very accommodating host.  Breakfast was a great treat and she made us feel at home in the short time we were there (we usually we were out and about and only at the flat for sleep).  Would definitely stay again.[QWERTY123]From the moment I arrived I knew I was in the right place. Doti welcomed me into her super comfortable home and we began chatting like old friends meeting after a long absence. The bedroom is exactly as the picture and as comfortable as it looks. I was asked what I might like for breakfast and was treated to fresh, warm bagels, cream cheese and coffee. Her location is great for everything in Chelsea so 'Chelsea Perfect' fits the name. Thoroughly enjoyed my two night stay and found a new friend too! Please book with Doti for a really delightful and delicious stay.[QWERTY123]Doti is a gracious host and has traveled a lot. I'm sure she has some excellent stories, though our mere 24 hours in the city kept us from hearing them. The place is lovely, and in a convenient location. Doti is very accommodating and was a lovely host.[QWERTY123]We had a very nice and pleasant stay on Doti's place.  She greeted us with much warmth and kindness from the time we arrived to the moment we left.  She won't hesitate to help the guests in any way she can, we really felt that we were in good hands.  With a great host in a perfect location in NYC, Chelsea Perfect is truly AMAZING!!! Thanks Doti![QWERTY123]Doti, was friendly and helpful. I couldn't have found a nicer host. Two thumbs up.[QWERTY123]We had a great experience with Doti at Chelsea Perfect. Our flight was late, we were hungry and she was patient and helpful in suggesting a nice place for us to eat when we landed.   

The accommodations are clean and comfortable - just like being home. The location is excellent, close to subway, shops and restaurants.  The breakfasts that Doti prepares are delicious!

Doti is an accommodating hostess, very nice and helpful. We plan on staying with her again!![QWERTY123]Doti has a small apartment in Manhattan, which was conveniently located near the pier where we were attending a wedding. Convenient to subway as well. She provided us with chocolates and water in our room and with coffee in the morning. We were only in the city for one night and she was very accommodating during our stay.[QWERTY123]Doti is a fantastic hostess. She was attentive and very kind. It was wonderful to wake up each day to breakfast, coffee and conversation. 
We felt like we were staying with a true friend. 
The neighborhood is great, and within easy walking distance to so many great places in Manhattan. Subway access also is easy. 
Overall a great experience from beginning to end.[QWERTY123]Dot is the perfect host and made us feel very comfortable.  We thoroughly enjoyed our short stay![QWERTY123]Doti nous a accueilli avec chaleur et hospitalité 
Elle nous a servi des petits déjeuners différents et excellents chaque Matin .
Elle nous a donné de bons conseils pour notre visite de NY.
Nous avons partagé de moments très agréables, elle a même pense à mon anniversaire en m'offrant un gâteau.
Elle est adorable 
Je la recommande ++++[QWERTY123]Doti was such a kind and accommodating host! Her home is cozy and welcoming and a great place to relax after a hectic day in the city. The room was clean and comfortable, and we had wonderful conversations with Doti over breakfast (which was delicious). We will definitely be staying again when next in the city! Thank you Doti! :)[QWERTY123]Doti's aprtment was very well situated for our needs and fun in NYC.  Doti was very accommodating about us leaving our bags after checkout and was great about communicating.  Breakfast was included and was perfect.  We enjoyed spending some time getting to know Doti, as well as her son and granddaughter, who were visiting briefly.  Although the arpartment is very full... of books and other items, the bedroom had a light and airy feel.  Doti, thanks for everything![QWERTY123]Jag och min son Oskar bodde hos Doti i fem nätter och det gav vår resa en särskild guldkant. Doti är en omtänksam värd som gör allt för att få sina gäster att trivas. Hos Doti bodde vi centralt i en trevlig New York-lägenhet med fantastiskt bra läge i Chelsea. Vi fick dessutom mycket goda frukostar, tips på restauranger, sevärdheter och kommunikationer och inte minst, möjlighet att umgås och finna en ny vän.[QWERTY123]Alles, was bisher über Doti geschrieben wurde, war glatt untertrieben! Sie ist so wunderbar, dass man eigentlich etwas negatives schreiben müsste,  um das nächste Mal in New York wieder die Chance zu haben, bei ihr wohnen zu dürfen.
Ohne Zweifel ein tolle Gastgeberin.
Einmal bei ihr, braucht man nie wieder etwas anderes zu suchen, wenn man nach New York reisen möchte.[QWERTY123]Very thankful for accommodating us with last minute travel change of plans.  Host was very gracious in providing breakfast,  coffee, and snacks and warm hospitality. Excellent location close to subway lines. Thank you![QWERTY123]La estadía fue excelente desde el primer momento.
Kerry nos recibió muy amablemente y enseguida nos hizo sentir parte del hogar. Disfrutamos mucho compartir charlas y conocer mucho sobre la historia y la cultura del país.
El departamento tiene una ubicación privilegiada, muy accesible y cerca de muchas atracciones, medios de transporte y negocios varios.
La comodidad es superior. La habitación está alejada de las áreas comunes, lo cual permite tener privacidad si se desea. La cama es comodísima, ideal para cuando llegas de caminar durante todo el día.
Todo está muy limpio. La ducha es ideal para sobrevivir al frío de la ciudad y la cocina tiene todo lo necesario para preparar lo que se desee.
El desayuno merece un apartado especial. Cada mañana teníamos el desayuno preparado de acuerdo a nuestros gustos (café, frutas, tostadas, bagels, huevos, cereales), ideal para iniciar el día con mucha energía.
En resumen, recomendamos 100% alojarse allí, por la calidad del lugar y la calidez y amabilidad de los anfitriones.[QWERTY123]Doti's place is a great value, for Manhattan. The location works well for me. My host was very friendlyand informative. I would certainly stay here again.[QWERTY123]We were in New York for the Tribeca film Festival, in Chelsea and TriBeCa, and this was a great location for us! A very good value. Doti was out of town, but her husband, Kerry, was very flexible and helpful, and made us very nice breakfasts to order each day.[QWERTY123]We had a wonderful weekend staying here in Chelsea.  Kerry was helping us while Doti was out of town, but Doti still emailed and checked up on us. They were both so helpful in what to do while in the area.  I would stay here anytime I was in the area again.[QWERTY123]The hosts take great pride in their home and rightly so... you will feel very welcomed in and part of the family. The communication prior to arrival and throughout the stay was excellent and they were very hospitable, offering anything we needed and more.[QWERTY123]If you have ever travelled in Europe, and stayed in a city flat, then this very similar. Look carefully at the pictures, because the hostess uses her space wisely and efficiently as all walls are utilized. The bedroom is huge. In fact, it is bigger than my hotel room at HGU.  The power strips on each side of the bed are accessible for all your electrical needs. Antique furniture is adorable and the mirrors on each side of bed are handy as the bathroom does not have a power outlet. The dining area is quaint, the kitchen compact. Coffee very good. Host and hostess are friendly and want to meet your breakfast preferences, but. Their specialty is local bagels with cream cheese and also bagel egg sandwiches. They have tips galore!  I needed a cobbler to fix my shoe, and was recommended  a close and reasonable one. Directions? I was pointed quickly in the right direction. By the way, the locations is ideal close to public transit and minutes away from everything. This apartment is shared with the hostess.[QWERTY123]Great place to stay that’s overshadowed by the even better host. Doti was so warm and accommodating, and it really stood out among all the airbnbs that I’ve stayed in. Would absolutely recommend to anyone looking for a place to stay in New York.[QWERTY123]First time we have shared a home and it couldn’t have been better. Most gracious hosts who were more like family!  Her breakfasts were wonderful and the bed was very comfy! Also very helpful with directions etc[QWERTY123]Doti, is kind, helpful and very welcoming . The location  is convenient to everything.[QWERTY123]Very clean, well-equipped room and amenities. Such a gracious host.  Perfect location, close to everything... or close to a train that will take you to everything . Literally had everything you could ask for in an AB&B experience.  Highest recommendation!!  Don't stay in a hotel when you can stay here.



[QWERTY123]Imagine the best possible B and B experience, make it better in every way; that's what it's like to stay at Doti's in Chelsea. A lovely private room with antique furnishings, comfortable bed, delicious breakfast ( fresh fruit,  eggs, bagels and more) and best of all, our hosts Doti and Kerry- kind, generous, brilliant, so helpful, fascinating folks!  We feel like they are our new family in New York. Great location - plenty  of cool shops nearby,  great restaurants,  close to transportation, and the Highline.  An ideal experience in every way![QWERTY123]I enjoyed my stay in the Chelsea neighborhood. The bedroom was large and very clean. Doti took great care in assuring that I had everything I needed, including a good breakfast in the morning![QWERTY123]Doti’s place was great for our 4 night stay in Chelsea. The location is wonderful and very convenient to the subway. Breakfast was prepared each morning which is rare and Doti’s husband, Kerry, did a great job of giving us some local tips to enjoy the city. Would definitely stay here again![QWERTY123]Chelsea perfect is a good name for this listing. Great location easily accessible by subway and located in the heart of a great neighborhood. The hosts are warm, generous, and have a great history of defining hospitality and the Airbnb model. The bedroom is a classic, very comfortable, and that room and the bathroom are immaculately clean and well appointed. Looking forward to going back soon![QWERTY123]People like Doti & Kerry are the reason I love to travel with AirBnB: they’re caring, interested and enabling you to live as a local for a few days.
Our stay in NYC was brilliant and Kerry prepared us an excellent breakfast every day. The house is located near various subway lines and is a great base to explore the city from.
Hope to come back some day ![QWERTY123]This was my second stay and it may become a regular spot for me. Super clean, great communication, very nice hosts, and a great location.[QWERTY123]This accommodation is unique and comfortable in Chelsea -one of the best (and safe)  areas of NYC. Affordable and easily found, Doti makes your experience in her home tailored to your needs. She is gracious and accommodating. This is what AirBnB is all about!!![QWERTY123]Doti’s place is great. I came late from a flight and booked last minute and she was willing to accommodate me with a smile.  Her place is clean and the space is very comfortable.[QWERTY123]I made a reservation for my friends and they really loved this place. They said both Doti and the place were so lovely. Additionally, I was so much impressed by her efforts to communicate with her guests. She not only fully informed the important things in regards to staying at her place but also cared about what the guests wanted and was willing to be flexible to accommodate the guests’ need or request. I hope to have a chance to stay at her house myself in the future.[QWERTY123]The room was very comfortable and provided everything I needed. Doti is very attentive and generous with her time, breakfasts, snacks and offers to assist. Having been a frequent user of Airbnb, this was my first time in NYC. I think this gave me a better understanding of typical lifestyle for many people living in NY flats. Doti has purposed every bit of the space. She has a collection of antiques and books that she lovingly displays in this Chelsea apartment. Communication was easy. I enjoyed walking to the Highline one morning and this neighborhood is convenient to many attractions.[QWERTY123]Doti's place is a wonderful place to stay when visiting NYC.  Location is great, the space is lovely, and Doti is a great hostess.  Thank you![QWERTY123]If you have the chance, you don’t want to pass up staying with Doti in the perfect location in NYC! My wife and I stayed in her guest bedroom, which looked exactly like the pictures. The bed was comfy, the room was clean, and Doti’s breakfast was wonderful. I had just arrived after being out of town for a conference and Doti was able to do my laundry for me. Her apartment is 2 blocks from the subway and perfect for getting anywhere around town. There are plenty of restaurants near by and great nightlife in the Chelsea area. We highly recommend staying with Doti and will definitely stay here next time we’re in NYC. Thanks Doti for being a superb host![QWERTY123]Doti was a great host!! I recommend it to anyone who is looking for a welcoming place to stay in a great, central location.[QWERTY123]Doti went out of her way to make our stay with a little one easy and special. Given the small space she has to work with everything we wanted and more was provided. Thanks Doti![QWERTY123]Delightful and thoughtful couple. Nice bed and bath. An inexpensive place to stay in Chelsea.[QWERTY123]Great location, great hosts![QWERTY123]Doti was an exceptionally wonderful host. She went to extra lengths to make sure we felt welcome and comfortable in her house. She even ordered delicious NY bagels for us one morning for breakfast. We loved getting to meet Doti and will 100% look to stay in her home again on our next visit to NYC.

The apartment is wonderfully located in Chelsea. Everything we wanted to visit was easily reachable by walking or the metro. The sleeping and living space was very comfortable. The bed was very nice. Towels and soaps were provided for us. Every want and need we had was filled. I would highly recommend Doti's home to future visitors.[QWERTY123]We were only there one night, arriving a bit late, but we were warmly welcomed and made to feel comfortable and at home in a very genuine way. Our large bedroom, and the bathroom (and the whole apartment), were very clean and well organized, with many interesting books everywhere we looked. A variety of fresh and tasty breakfast choices were offered (Doti is one of the rare hosts that really understands the second ""b"" of Airbnb), and our check-out day needs were graciously accommodated. The location is excellent, very convenient to downtown, midtown and uptown, and the neighborhood has plenty of local interest in itself. And all of this at a very affordable rate. I can't recommend Doti's place highly enough.[QWERTY123]Doti is a great host, with a very comfortable and cozy space. Would stay again 8/8[QWERTY123]Doti's apartment chock full of interesting items and books to peruse.  Her hospitality cannot be beat. We enjoyed every minute in their apartment.  The room is immaculate as was the bathroom. Doti and her husband were attentive to our needs, friendly and made us feel very comfortable.  We couldn't have asked for a better place to stay in New York City and hope to stay there again at some point.  Thank you, Doti, for helping to make our stay so special.[QWERTY123]A wonderful expereicene with a lovely host. Thanks so much Doti for a memorable visit.[QWERTY123]Doti's place is nice, comfortable and clean!   Doti is a very nice host![QWERTY123]Doti’s place was in the perfect location right in the middle of everything! Her hospitality was amazing and I really enjoyed talking to her! Wish we could have stayed longer! Definitely recommend![QWERTY123]Amazing location and Doti & Kerry were amazingly wonderful hosts. Highly recommend their place, especially with their hospitality.[QWERTY123]Me and my husband just spent a wonderful weekend here. Kerry took a really good care of us. He welcomed us by the door when we arrived and gave us a lot of tips about how to visit New York. He prepared lovely breakfast and borrowed umbrella to us when raining. It’s just felt like home. 
The bedroom is bigger than I thought and the bed is comfortable. I will definitely choose here if I come back to New York in the future![QWERTY123]It is the good place to stay. The location is very convenion. And Hosts are very nice.[QWERTY123]Doti was very kind and thoughtful and her place was very nice. The room has its own air conditioner so it was perfectly cool. The bed was comfortable and the place was very clean. Doti was also a very nice host. I’d definitely stay here again.[QWERTY123]Doti was a great host. Location is awesome, close to the subway, easy walk to anything you need. We'll stay again if the opportunity arises."	40.74687317101982	-74.00595199525428	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/7322	3	140.0	0.8

Great location.
Book with confidence.[QWERTY123]Great apartment and in a location that even impressed New Yorkers, I'd happily recommend this as a place to stay.[QWERTY123]Lovely appartment in lovely neighbourhood, basic but very mutch okay (excellent beds - very important), on a terrific location, with china town on one hand and hip boutiques en restaurants on the other,  subway around the corner, williams brigde nearby for biking to brooklyn.
louise[QWERTY123]Really enjoyed my stay in this NYC apt. Good light, spacious rooms and simple but has everything you need. Living room couch is comfy for chilling and the 4 person dining room table is great to sit and eat or work at. Beds were comfy. It's up a 4 flight walk up, but it wasn't bad. Place was very clean as well.[QWERTY123]We loved this apartment. It was super clean and comfortable, and it was in a really great location. Joanna was really helpful and left a list of suggestions and contacts for our stay. I'd definitely recommend this apartment to anyone looking for accommodation in NYC.[QWERTY123]The apartment looks just like it does in the photos and is in a fabulous location, well within walking distance to all of south Manhattan and with the subway just round the corner if you can't be bothered walking. The kitchen is big and spacious and everything is well stocked.The building itself is very quiet but I wouldn't say it's a quiet street – but then I'm a light sleeper and I think it's pretty standard for NY, and it's nothing that earplugs can't deal with. 
We had a great time at this place and I thoroughly recommend staying here.[QWERTY123]Joanna was helpful and responsive. Her place is simple but comfortable. Exactly how it looks in the photos. We stayed with our two teenage kids and it was a great base for exploring the city. Excellent location. Plenty of places to eat and Essex St food market nearby as well as a great local subway. Short walk to Soho and East Village. Fab.[QWERTY123]The apartment is nice and airy with a good sized kitchen and bathroom for a week's hol. It was a little noisy in the early mornings, though I think we were unlucky with some street works happening outside for a couple of days.

The apartment is close to some good bars and an excellent coffee shop (88 Orchard). The close subway made it really easy to explore NYC. A really nice place to base ourselves for our break. I'd certainly recommend.[QWERTY123]Apartamento muy bien situado, limpio y con bares cerca que no molestan si quieres dormir. Muy cerca de lineas de metro al centro de manhattan y aeropuerto jfk. Muy recomendable

Very well situated and clean appartment. There are several bars near but don´t disturb anything. Very close from subway lines to manhattan center and jfk airport. Very recomendable[QWERTY123]Cute apartment at a perfect location in the heart of the lower east side. 4 people (2 couples) stayed here during xmas and new years. It is a quiet building and neighborhood, and everything you might need (bakery, deli, bank, pharmacy, bars and resurants) are just minutes away. Host was very helpful, accommodating and prompt in repsonding to inquiries!
Thank you Joanna![QWERTY123]Booking with Joanna was a smooth and easy process. She is prompt and organized - she sends a thorough and helpful welcome email about the apartment and the neighborhood before check-in that everyone appreciated. Her apartment is true to photos and it is in an excellent and convenient location in NY.[QWERTY123]My husband and I, with our son & daughter, both in their early twenties stayed in Joanna's apartment for  2 weeks. Before our arrival, communication with the host was excellent.  The apartment was clean, airy and spacious; exactly as presented on airbnb. Also, it felt very secure. The location was just perfect for all of us. This apartment was an excellent base and we would definitely, stay there again, should we be so lucky to return from sunny Sydney. [One note, there are no keys for the bedroom doors, so best not to lock them.][QWERTY123]We spent a very nice week in Joanna's apartment. It was simple but clean, comfortable and convenient (short walk to the subway station). 
We enjoyed the neighborhood very much. There are good restaurants and an excellent coffee shop ""88 Orchard"". I'd certainly recommend.[QWERTY123]We were a group of four that had a wonderful time in Joannas place.
The location was great, with lot of things happening at every corner in the neighborhood. Easy access to subway as well as walking distance to Soho and East Village. 
Check in and check out were smooth as Joanna was very flexible and she also quickly answered the questions we had.
After a week we wished we could have stayed longer and would highly recommend staying here for anyone visiting New York.[QWERTY123]Joanna's place was such a comfortable, clean and easy place to stay at. It's in a fantastic spot with so many great restaurants and bars around, yet just far enough away so the noise isn't too bad. The LES does get noisier at night on the weekends but we just put fans on to cover any ambient noise from the street.
As a host, Joanna is really responsive and has put a lot of thought in to make the place comfortable. 
We got caught in Hurricane Sandy during our stay and Joanna was really helpful, checked in with us and made sure we were ok after being stranded at JFK.
The place matches all the great reviews.[QWERTY123]We got caught up in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy but Joanna kept in contact with us and was very helpful in answering questions and making sure things were sorted out for us.  
The apartment was a great base to explore the city.  It was clean and comfortable.  There was heaps of room for 4 of us who stayed for a week - 2 reasonable sized seperate bedrooms with queen beds.  LES is a great neighbourhood to stay in.  Lots of restaurnats, bars and shops nearby.  Check out the Tenement museum if you have a chance.  It is also very convenient for public transport.  
The neighbourhood can be quiet noisy overnight, particuarly on the weekends, but nothing that a pair of earplugs or a few drinks won't fix!  
The only con that I can think of is that the heater can't be regulated so can be quite hot at times, particuarly at night.  Again, easy fixed though with opening a window.  
Would definitely recommend to stay!  Joanna is a great host.[QWERTY123]Nice apartment in a great location, Joanna was very helpful and made our stay easier for us. Would recommend staying here if you're looking for a cool place to stay in the Lower East Side.[QWERTY123]I had a great stay at Joanna's place, it was exactly as advertised and no problem getting the keys.[QWERTY123]This is a wonderful apartment. The apartment is in a fantastic location - the Lower East Side if very accessible by public transport - with a subway station 2 blocks away that till take you right into midtown and anywhere else you want to go. Around in the area there are plenty of bars, shops and restaurants to keep you occupied without even having to leave the area - Bar 169 and Dudley's to name a few. Great coffee shops right around the corner too. The apartment itself is in good condition. It very easily fit our four guests - with generous double beds and plenty of sitting room in the living room. The bathroom and kitchen are nice and large (for New York) as well.  The heating isnt amazing - it's controlled by the building so we found it a little chilly for our liking. Ended up just putting on more blankets and jumpers. The heating in one of the bedrooms doesn't seem to work. The apartment is located on the top floor of an apartment block that doesn't have an elevator - so be prepared to carry your luggage up 7 flights of stairs when you first arrive.
Small cons aside, this is a great apartment in a great location in New York and we would thoroughly recommend it to anyone wanting to stay in the city.[QWERTY123]The apartment was great! It was even better than pictured. For such a long stay, we were really able to feel at home here. The neighborhood was very friendly and easily accessible!
[QWERTY123]I had an amazing 3 weeks at Joanna's apartment. 

Really central to the Lower East Side - fantastic cafes, restaurants and bars all within a hop, skip and a jump of the apartment. Also only a few minutes walk to the subway which can get you uptown or to Brooklyn relatively easy.

If you're not sure where to stay in NYC - this is the place for you! A 15 minute walk gets you to Soho, Little Italy, Nolita & Chinatown.

Similar to the other reviews, note that there are 4 flights of stairs & no elevator, however don't let that worry you.

It was still fairly cold in NYC however there were no issues at all with the heating.

You do get a little street noise, but its NYC after all!

Joanna was a wonderful host and I had no problems at all. I did leave a jacket behind but Joanna was able to ship it to me without any stress or troubles.

Overall, it was great to come back to the apartment after a busy day out and about. I have absolutely no hesitation recommending Joanna's apartment to family and friends and of course anyone reading this![QWERTY123]Joanna's apartment was just as the pictures show. It was spacious & clean with 2 very comfortable beds.
There was a lot of closet space & shelves for our belongings. 
I love the area- lots of great cafe's & shops. 
My colleague & I were very comfortable & would gladly recommend Joanna's place to others. 
Joanna was very thorough in her communication & I felt would be available very quickly if needed- however we didn't need anything whilst there.[QWERTY123]I stayed in the apartment for 2 months over the summer. 

Check in was very easy, Joanna was very accomodating to when I needed to check in and provided me with keys and gave me an overview of the apartment. 

Amentities- everything you could need was there, towels, plates, toaster, extra sheets, dvd player. I really did not need to buy many extras. There was even essential food items like salt, pepper, ect so if you needed to cook that was all there (this may vary depending the the stay though). The apartment was very clean and I never had any problems. Joanna even asked if we needed a new air conditioner since it was so hot during our stay. We never had a problem with the AC and the two window units worked very well and pretty quickly. 

The apartment is on the 4th floor of a walk up but it was not very bad at all. For laundry- there is a really cheap place around the corner that will do it for you. TV- there is only very basic cable but I was pretty busy so it did not really matter. The beds were pretty comfortable, I put a extra blanket under the bed to make it a little more fluffy but it is nothing to stress about. There was also a ton of hangers which was nice. 

The building is right across from a school and is relatively quiet for NYC honestly. Around the corner there are a ton of restaurants (my favorite is this awesome mexican place Barrio Chino). The F train is a block away also. If you like to run, the Williamsburg bridge is like 5 blocks away and is a great work out. A lot of my favorite bars and shopping are on ludlow or a 10 minute walk so it is a really great location. 

Overall- my roommate and I had a wonderful stay and it was very easy to work with Joanna. If we ever needed anything, she was always willing to help. I would definitely recommend this apartment in the future.Great place to stay![QWERTY123]L'appartement  est situé dans un quartier très agréable à vivre, de nombreux cafés, restaurants et petites boutiques se trouvent à proximité, c'est un endroit très vivant et à taille humaine.
Nous avons passé un très agréable séjour dans l'appartement de Joanna, on se sent rapidement à l'aise, les photos sont représentatives du lieu, Après de longues et éreintantes promenades dans New York,retrouver un petit nid douillet est un plus. 
La décoration est soignée et cosy, chose très appréciable, l'appartement est très propre et vraiment confortable!!
Nous n'avons pas eu le plaisir de rencontrer notre hôte,mais à notre arrivée une de ses amies était là pour nous accueillir de façon très sympathique
Tout le long de notre séjour nous sommes restés en contact avec Joanna par mail, elle a répondu à toutes nos sollicitations de façon très rapide, nous donnant en prime des petits conseils shopping pour ma fille de 21 ans.
En bref, un appartement très bien et une hôte très disponible.Nous le conseillons vivement à tous ceux qui veulent passer un super séjour sans mauvaise surprise.

[QWERTY123]The apartment is large and well appointed. It was clean and had everything to make our stay enjoyable. It was close to subways and transportation. We liked the vibe of the Lower East Side and Litlle Italy. Joanna was easy to communicate with and we had no problem moving in or out. 
[QWERTY123]I recently stayed at Jo's apartment with a friend.  The apartment was just as Jo had described.  Nice and roomy and everything you would want.  The area was fantastic, we didn't visit the same bar or restaurant twice - so many within walking distance. Close to transport and a nice 20 minute walk to Soho which was great.  The top floor was a bit of a challenge with the suitcases, but once you were in, it was fine.  We found the stairs great exercise.  The unit was lovely and light and very secure.  
Jo was a pleasure to deal with - we would definitely stay there again.[QWERTY123]JoLynn was very straightforward and accommodating. Very easy to deal with.[QWERTY123]Flat was great and just what we needed. Great location and plenty of space. Jo was super helpful and accommodating too. Thanks![QWERTY123]Great communication and lovely flat in a great location. Really spacious for a NYC place. Comfy beds and a super nice living room to hang out in with comfy sofas. It's an old tenement so has some idiosyncrasies, the steam heating is quite noisy, and the main bedroom fronts onto a busy LES street so bring some earplugs if you want to sleep late.[QWERTY123]L'appartement est situé dans un quartier agréable, animé, à proximité immédiate des commerces, bars, dinner... et de la station de subway Essex street, ce qui est très pratique....
L'appartement est agréable, lumineux mais souffre malheureusement d'un manque d'entretien flagrant, d'une bonne insonorisation, l'ensemble des équipements étant très largement amorti. 
Les chambres sont spacieuses avec une literie de bonne qualité. 
La salle de bain est sombre et exigüe avec un aspect ""bricolé"" indigne d'une location. 
L'appartement ne dispose pas de connexion (Website hidden by Airbnb) faut dont se tourner vers les commerces de proximité disposant d'une connexion wifi.
Une désinsectisation serait souhaitable car la présence quotidienne de cafards dans la salle de bain et le salon n'est pas très agréable.....
Les parties communes sont vétustes.
Le standing proposé n'est pas en conformité avec le montant du loyer demandé, avec un malentendu flagrant sur l'emploi du mot ""renovated""[QWERTY123]First of all, Joanna is excellent at communicating. She always responds within a few hours (or sometimes minutes!) From the booking process to confirming your arrival details to contacting you the day before you're about to leave, she makes it all so easy. 

Wow - what a treat it was to stay in Joanna's apartment! It was exactly how it was described. We were met by Joanna's friend, Roger, who helped us carry our luggage up the four flights of stairs (thank you Roger!). The apartment has everything you'll need: hair dryer, coffee maker, iron, etc. It also has a really peaceful vibe to it. It was tempting to stay in every night! The back bedroom is quieter and darker (which I prefer) and the front bedroom is along the street so there is a bit more noise. Joanna has a standing fan that we put on at night and the white noise would drown out any street noise so we actually slept really well. You never hear any noise from the neighbors or ever see them. It really felt like we were at home. 

The area where the apartment is located is surrounded by tons of cool restaurants with lots of hipsters walking around (fyi, be sure to have dinner at Stanton Social) and the subway is only a few minutes away. But, also check out the amazing food in Chinatown and Little Italy, too! There's also a gigantic (and I mean gigantic) Whole Foods about a 10 minute walk and a wine store next door to it with a decent selection of inexpensive wines. I could go on and on but the lower east side has absolutely everything you'll need or want - and I can't even begin to tell you how close it is to walk to SoHo...

Thank you, Joanna, for making our girls long weekend trip so memorable! I can't wait to get back to New York and stay here again! xx[QWERTY123]The apartment was just as described, spacious (especially by New York standards) located in charming and vibrant neighbourhood.  
The appartment is in a great location in Lower East Side with everything you need within walking distance: transport, great coffee, grocery store and many wonderful bars / restaurants. 
The appartment is located on the 4th floor with a walk up which apart from the small challenge with the suitcases it was fine to handle.  
All up we really enjoyed our stay.[QWERTY123]JoLynn was a great host. She is excellent at communicating. There were a few minor issues, but these were dealt with swiftly, which was really appreciated. We found the apartment to be as it was described; clean and comfortable, accommodating the four of us with relative ease. The beds were great, and we were able to sleep quite soundly. The furnishings were a lovely touch of character. & the location is great! It is located close to the subway and around the corner from some great restaurants and coffee shops. We really enjoyed our 2 week's of holiday in New York. It was a treat to stay here! Thanks JoLynn![QWERTY123]Joanna tiene un hermoso y confortable apartamento. Los ambientes son  más amplios y comodos de lo que se puede ver en las fotos y el lugar tiene todo lo necesario para pasarla muy bien. Está muy bien ubicado: a 150 metros tiene el subway  F, J y M. En pocas manzanas alrededor hay muchos lugares para comer o tomar algo y escuchar música (en LES hay muchos lugares para escuchar rock). Está a 5 min a pie del Soho y Nolita y si quieren escuchar blues caminando 15 o 20 min o en 5 min de metro llegan a Greenwich Village. Y lo mas importante, Joanna y Jared son unos excelentes anfitriones. Nos dieron muchos consejos sobre lugares para visitar y disfrutar. La comunicación con ellos es muy accesible y rápida y se interesan en que los huespedes estén bien. Volvería a alojarme sin dudarlo en este apartamento la próxima vez que visitemos NYC.[QWERTY123]This is a great location to use as a base to explore NYC. It is in a fantastic neighbourhood with lots of amazing places to eat and cool bars within a block of the appartment. You can easily walk to lower manhattan, TriBeca, SoHo, Little Italy,NoHo and NoLita. Then there are 2 subway stations that are really close and will take you anywhere else you want to go. There is some street noise, which is to be expected, but very little noise from the neighbours. JoLynn was really easy to communicate with and the check in process was really easy.[QWERTY123]Pasamos 7 noches en la casa de Joanna. La casa es tal y como se muestra en las fotos. Cómoda y acogedora. Muy bien situada cerca de Little Italy en un bloque donde hay magnificos restaurantes y establecimientos. Tiene estación de metro al lado con línea directa a pleno centro de Manhattan en unos 15 minutos.
Joanna respondió a todas nuestras dudas rápidamente en todo momento y nos ayudó en todo lo que requerimos. Nos informó debidamente antes de llegar a la ciudad y permitió que dejásemos nuestro equipaje la mañana del último día después del checkout hasta que salimos hacia el aeropuerto por la tarde.
Sólo criticaría tres cosas que podrían mejorar la estancia de futuros huéspedes: la calefacción no funcionaba en una de las dos habitaciones aunque no pasamos demasiado frío, a pesar de estar bastante limpia encontramos algún insecto en la cocina (hay que cuidar esas cosas porque deslucen mucho) y por último creo que está de más hacer pagar la lavandería de sabanas y toallas a los inquilinos después de desembolsar 100 dólares de limpieza.
A pesar de ello, nuestra estancia fue agradable y recomiendo la casa y la atención de Joanna. Gracias.


[QWERTY123]JoLynn's apartment was perfect. Just as described, well situated in the centre of everything and very spacious. Can't fault it .[QWERTY123]My dad and I had a great 6 day vacation in NYC and were lucky to stay in Joanna's appartment. It provides enough space for at least 3-4 persons if needed, it's very clean, cozy and feels very safe. Around the appartment you'll find dozens of eateries, coffee bars, delis etc. Everything you need is in close vicinity, even easy access to the subway and busses. We just haven't met Joanna in person, but maybe next time :) Key hand over and appartment description went easily anyhow![QWERTY123]JoLynn was very responsive and flexible in our last minute booking.
The apartment is as pictured, NY-large and comfortable, in a great neighborhood (lower east side 2 blocks from the Tenement museum, great bars, restaurants, shops, chinatown and several subway stops.) Especially liked Amuse wine bar, Vita coffee shop, September wine store, Congee Village, plus Reformation and Szeki for fun but not expensive women's clothing. ODD had great (expensive) designer clothing for men and women. Katz deli is an experience and excellent but expensive pastrami sandwiches.

Bring or buy bath soap and shampoo as they are not provided.[QWERTY123]Excellent apartment in LES! Joanne was very prompt in booking and flexible in my longer term stay. I highly recommend this 2 bedroom for others.[QWERTY123]Appartement situé à proximité des métros

[QWERTY123]Really great apartment in a really fun part of town! Very spacious with great appliances. Really the only thing we didn't like about the apartment was the five story walk up, but you get used to it and it is not a big deal. I would definitely recommend this apartment for people staying in NY, especially young people who are looking to go out and explore bars/nightlife.[QWERTY123]Awesome location in the Lower East Side about 3 min from Delancey subway station. Just be careful with the five flights of stairs. Joanna made the check in and check out easy and seamless. There were several things that needed service/cleaning left from the previous tenant but Joanna was quick to respond and helped us get service in a timely way. She was easily accessible by email or phone. I would stay here again for a long term stay. Perfect for a month![QWERTY123]Acabamos de chegar, de uma estadia de 35 dias. O apartamento é exatamente como é descrito, confortável, amplo, bem localizado. O bairro é repleto de bares e restaurantes maravilhosos. Você está a duas quadras pequenas da estação do metrô que o levará a uptown: ""Times Square"", ""Broadway"", ""Rockfeller Center"" e muito mais. Fácil deslocamento para o aeroporto também.
Local absolutamente seguro, durante o dia e a noite. Conta com ""Pharmacy"" service 24 horas, o que inclui um mini mercado, e na esquina tem um ""Deli"" 24 horas também. Serviço de lavanderia a menos de uma quadra. Lojas interessantes e o Tennement Museum estão bem próximos. Você estará a poucas quadras da Chinatonw, Little Italy e Soho. É muito bom camninhar por lá, fazer compras, almoçar ou jantar em excelentes restaurantes. Sem falar nos cafés e sorvetes...
Joanne é uma excelente proprietária. Super profissional!! 
Recomendo muito o imóvel!!! Não tenho absolutamente nenhuma restrição ou consideração negativa a fazer.[QWERTY123]Joanna was very casual easy to deal with, key pick up was not a problem despite Joanna being out of town. The apartment is old but really good. Had to turn off the heating system during the night to eliminate a few noises, light sleepers bring ear plugs! It didn't bother me but be warned there are 68 steps from the street to the apartment door!

The neighbourhood is great, walking distance to Soho and lots of fantastic restaurants and cafes around the corner. I would certainly stay here again.[QWERTY123]My sister and I stayed in the apartment for over 4 weeks. We really loved it! The neighborhood was amazing, lots of bars, restaurants and cute little shops. 
5 minute walk to my favorite neighborhood Soho! The subway is around the corner and will take you anywhere in the city.
Joanne was a lovely host! She made sure we had the key(s) and she provided enough sheets and towels for our whole stay.
She's very nice, always replies when you have questions and she made sure that everything was okay.
The apartment is on the top floor, so make sure you don't have a problem with walking stairs everyday. The streets can be a bit noisy, so when you're a light sleeper make sure you bring earplugs.
My sister and I had an amazing time and on our next trip to the city we would certainly stay there again![QWERTY123]A comfortable apartment in a great location. Walking distance to many great areas to explore with more restaurants of any cuisine just a block or two away. Jo was great to chat to and helped us throughout our stay when we asked. My tip is to check out Vanessa's Kitchen which is only a couple of blocks away for the best (and cheapest) dumplings I've had so far.[QWERTY123]The location was fantastic, and I am very appreciative that JoLynn could handle our last minute request. She was pleasant, communicative and a caring host.[QWERTY123]Despite not meeting her in person, Joanna was very quick to respond to messages and allowed us early check-in/late check-out as our flight schedules weren't ideal. The flat itself was wonderful, though the walk up was a good workout. A good size for our party of three.[QWERTY123]The apartment was great, cosy and exactly as shown in the photos.
The neighbourhood is great with lots of bars, restaurants and museums.
The subway is really close for quick access uptown or to Brooklyn.
Jo was very communicative and the whole process for checking in and out was easy.

Overall a big thumbs up![QWERTY123]The apartment was in a great location and exactly as pictured. It was plenty roomy for three women to share. The neighbors were quiet although the area is busy and the radiators loud at night so recommend ear plugs. We were disappointed that the coffee maker was broken and the pans too rusty to feel comfortable using to heat water. This is a no frills accommodation and the first time in my history of holiday rentals that I needed to make arrangements for laundering the bedding and towels. It is usually included in the cleaning fee. Bright and sunny and overall a good place to stay while visiting Manhattan.[QWERTY123]The apartment is at a great location and the neighborhood is fantastic. It is a walk up and we had some problems with a leaking sink, but it was fixed pretty soon. On a Sunday! So thank you for that! 
The bedrooms are great and we recommend this place.[QWERTY123]Les photos ne correspondent pas à la réalité ,la luminosité des pièces est quasi inexistante dans la cuisine ou il faut allumer  la luminaire car petite fenètre coté cour,le séjour aussi est plutot sombre pourtant en plein mois d'aout.Les deux chambres sont fonctionnelles mais poussière sous les lits et des cartons vides.Quasiment pas de vaisselle pour 4 personnes ,ily avait 3 mugs à café et quelques assiettes dépareillées.[QWERTY123]The apartment was in a great location in a great neighbourhood. Joanna was a great host and was helpful with any queries we had.[QWERTY123]Jolynn did a great job of communicating with me during the process and was accommodating and available when we arrived late at night and were a bit confused about location of key, etc. The location of the place was great and it was clean when we arrived. Both beds very comfortable.  All was good, though it did get cold and the main heat in the building had not been turned on yet. I ended up sleeping in my down jacket the last 2 nights (note: I do  run cold and it didn't bother my friend quite as much). A portable space heater would have made it much more comfortable. There was also some confusion about paying cash for the apartment to be cleaned and prepaying for the laundry at the end of the stay--because the cleaning fee was already factored into the overall price via the Airbnb site. After talking with Jolynn we didn't need to pay those extra cleaning fees. 

 Other then that, it was a great apartment for us and I would recommend it to others![QWERTY123]Positive:
- Good well equipped and furnished apartment in a lively vibrant area, where you want to go out and be out there; 
- Easy check-in - all very well organized;
- Quick communication (helped with a portable heater for the 2nd bedroom)


Improvement points:
- Very noisy: At any point in time day or night 85 dB. 1) During the day time - there's an open construction site (tentatively running through 2018); 2) Old heating system making loud noise (80-85dB) every night at 4 in the morning;
- 5th floor - a bit complicated with large suit cases (good training though :) ).
- No microwave; dishwasher; washing machine (closest laundry 2 blocks away).
- Leaking tap in the kitchen. Not fixed in 4 months;
- Communication is quick, but not always solution driven[QWERTY123]THE NEIGHBORHOOD!!! 

The neighborhood that this airbnb is in is SO cool. There are tons of delicious, super hip spots for food, coffee, drinks, etc within blocks. We were so so happy with the location. 

The apartment overall was also great. Clean, cute and a decent size for a prewar apartment. Wifi worked great (which was a big deal for us as we were traveling for work). One of the couches was pretty long and very comfortable. Totally a viable option for a third person to stay on, though I can't remember if you are allowed more than two guests. 

Only two small cautions that make this a 4 instead of 5 stars. Turns out a 5th floor walk up is a bit of a bummer. Day 4 of coming back from a long work day and then having to climb 4-5 flights was tough. No elevator. Second, the shower was tough to get hot water in. The hot water is probably shared with the rest of the building, so sometimes we were fine and other times it was a cold one. 

Like I said, great great great location, well kept up and a super value for what and where it is. Check in was easy and there were very clear house rules and institutions which I appreciate. (If you don't like rules you might want to check this out before booking.)

It's a winner! Book it![QWERTY123]My coworker and i had a good stay at JoLynn's apartment.  We were in NY for work and didn't spend much time in the apartment, but the location is amazing and the size was good for two people.[QWERTY123]We had a great stay at this place and the host was friendly and helpful. The location is very close to the Delancey station and there are plenty of good places to eat & drink at nearby. Excellent value for what you get.[QWERTY123]JoLynn is responsive, delightful, and has a wonderful place![QWERTY123]It's very good location and clean place. However, the heater in the street-facing room has a very loud-weird noise. We stayed there for a week and each night, it started producing ""bam-bam"" kind of sound around 5 am and we had to sleep on the couch in the living room because there was no way sleeping with that loud sound. Since you can hear the sound from the living room, we never had a nice sleep. It was annoying after paying that much money for the apartment. And since it's a very old apartment and heater system I don't think that it's something fixable.[QWERTY123]JoLynn’s place was exactly as shown in the photos. Lots of public transport very close. The apartment is situated within walking distance to Soho, Little Italy and East Village. The lounge area is spacious and great to relax in after a big day of exploring. 
The apartment was in the 5 floor of a walk up which was great for staying healthy. It is across the road from a school and I felt that contributed to the feeling of safety in the area.
Thanks for a great stay.[QWERTY123]Misleading, broken, and invasion of privacy. Initially thought this property would be an amazing place for a summer in New York. Unfortunately upon arrival I was extremely disappointed. Many of the fixtures and appliances (including kitchen, fans, lights, air conditioning) were broken or malfunctioning making living conditions very difficult. For the price of this of this listing, I felt that I was completely misled since the property severely underdelivered. For longterm clients, the host enforces a policy where a cleaner must clean the house every two weeks. While this is no issue, what was a problem was the invasion of privacy whereby the cleaners took pictures of my belongings and sent it to the host.[QWERTY123]Best location in the city!! Wonderful apartment!! The friendliest host!! I definitely recommend this awesome place!![QWERTY123]Great location, nice space. I love the Lower East Side and this spot was a great base to explore from. Hope to stay here again in the future!"	40.718512073765424	-73.98892346023239	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/19169	4	285.0	0.733333

But a nice location to visit the city. All things are fine. Thanks to the host.[QWERTY123]The is was by far the best place that I've ever stayed at in New York. The apartment was neat and clean, looked just like the Photo's and totally lived up to all that it stated. Alexis was friendly and the entire process was simple and easy. The traffic wasn't much of a bother to me, I actually enjoyed it. The apartment was in the best part of the city and I would love to stay there again. 
Thanks Alexis....[QWERTY123]Tout est vraiment parfait la situation de l'appart, la terrasse, la literie, internet, vous pouvez y aller les yeux fermés.
Alexis et sa femme sont très sympathiques.
Merci a vous 
GG et Auré[QWERTY123]Alexis and his wife are thoughtful and gracious hosts.  The apartment is great - - clean, the master bedroom is amazing (includes great unit to hang & store clothes), the deck is fabulous... the day beds are okay to sleep on too.  Truly a great apartment and location with short walks [5-10 minutes] to Meatpacking, West Village, Chelsea Market and around 20 minute walk to SOHO/Chinatown.  In other words, if you don't want to walk cabs are an inexpensive option or take the metro (station is 1/2 block from your front door).[QWERTY123]Nice apartment, nice terrace, nice location ! I definitively recommend it[QWERTY123]Alexis was very responsive when we reserved his apartment and answered all of our questions.

The apartment is extremely well located, on the edge of Meatpacking district and West Village.

If there are people sleeping in the living area downstairs, there is noise coming from the street as it's quite a major one and New Yorkers like to honk a lot whilst driving!

Unfortunately we were not able to meet with Alexis personally as he was out of town, but he emailed regularly to ensure we were happy with everything and gave detailed instructions for picking up keys and dropping them off.

I would highly recommend Alexis' apartment, based on the location of the property and Alexis' hospitality and a bargain compared to staying in hotels!

[QWERTY123]Alexis' place is in a great location and is comfortable with lots of closet room to hang clothes.  There is traffic noise when sleeping in the lounge area, but guess that is quite common in NYC!  The main bedroom was much quieter.  Alexis was such a great host and he let us leave our suitcases with him until late in the day before our flight that night back to Sydney.  I would definitely recommend his place to any visitors to NYC![QWERTY123]The Location is PERFECT, very nice place.[QWERTY123]I can truly recommend Alexis' apt! I stayed with my daughter for twelfe nights and we had a great time there. The apt is clean and well equipped - you'll find everthing you'll need. The location is perfect for exploring the city by walking or you'll find all metro-lines in short walking distance on 14th street. As others have mentioned, the place is not really quiet, but if you love the sound of the city, as we did, this should not bother you at all.
Thynks Alexis ... we hope to come back soon![QWERTY123]Easy stay, everything worked as planned. We were all perfectly happy with the space and the location... great for 3-4 friends. Super convenient access to the entire city. Thanks![QWERTY123]We had a fantastic stay here.  Very clean apartment. Three of us stayed for four nights and there was plenty of room.  The two couches in the living room were the size of single beds and comfortable to sleep on. Great location for local exploring and one block from the subway.  Would definitely consider staying here again.[QWERTY123]Nice, clean apartment in very convenient location.  The pictures are accurate.

I would caution anyone who has trouble with stairs that this is a fifth floor walk up.  The advantage of being on the fifth floor is a reduction in noise from the street, I slept very comfortably and was not woken up by any noise.

[QWERTY123]We had a really nice stay in New York.
The location of the apartment is very good. Compared to hotel rooms, the place is spacious and the terrace even has a barbecue. Stayed in Nov so we didn't use it, but for the summer time it would be great.
Whenever we had a problem, Alexis replied quickly and was very helpful.
Thanks.[QWERTY123]Great apartment, and great location. Very comfortable bed and everything you need was there  -- and although I ended up barely using the wonderful roof terrace, that's definitely a plus.

Alexis was flexible about check-in and check-out, which was wonderful.

Of course a through street will not be entirely quiet, and it is good to be aware that this is actually a fifth-floor walk-up when booking. Neither was a problem for me. 

The apartment had obviously been surface cleaned after the last tenants so it didn't feel directly dirty, but it would have benefited from a more thorough cleaning as there was a layer of dust/grime on the moldings and stains on doors and cabinet doors.[QWERTY123]Duplex très agréable dans un des meilleurs quartier de New-York ! Je recommande vivement cet appartement , Alexis est un hôte parfait , communication aisée et efficace . j'y retournerai avec plaisir ![QWERTY123]Great apartment in a fantastic location. Spacious and full of light, this was a great place to return to after busy days out exploring New York. Convieniently close to the subway with many shops and restaurants close by. Alexis was a fantastic host and was very easy to deal with.[QWERTY123]The host canceled my reservation 39 days before arrival.[QWERTY123]Overall our stay was great. Alexis is a fair host and very helpful. Location is perfectly central for Chelsea galleries and the Meetpacking district. Only downfall is the stairs - 

Thanks again Alexis![QWERTY123]Fun neighborhood, and close to basically all transportation.  Our host was extremely helpful and fun. We were there in the warmer months and loved the outdoor deck. Perfect amount of space for a small family.  As others have mentioned it is a walk-up, but I didn't mind the stairs.[QWERTY123]Good location, nice apartment, great host.
Wonderful airbnb experience![QWERTY123]The apartment is amazingly located and was very clean. Just be aware that it is quite a walk up - more than I was expecting, and certainly a strain when carrying bags! Alexis is very helpful.[QWERTY123]What an incredible place!!! Perfect location near the best restaurants, clubs and bruch places, amazing roof terrace with awesome  view and the greatest host!!!
Highly recommended, our tríp wouldn,t have been the same if we had rented another apartment. It was definitely a plus to have such a nice home to get back at the end of the day.
Thank you Alexis and your lovely wife!!!

[QWERTY123]Very Nice place to stay at. If I go to NYC again, I will definitely want to stay at this spot. Very good location, nicely furnished apt, the host Alexis is very easy to deal with. The only part that I didn't like was walking up to 74 steps since the apt is on the 5th floor. other then that, Its definitely worth it. btw, this was my first Airbnb exp ever.[QWERTY123]Alexis has been a great host during my 3 nights stay, the apartment is ""well-equip"", and more importantly, the host has been accommodating to my late checkout request....definitely will recommend to Airbnb members out there!

Cheers!

alvin[QWERTY123]L'appartement est totalement conforme aux photographies, il est très bien situé, toutes les lignes de bus et de métro à proximité, direct depuis l'aéroport JFK. Tous les équipements sont dans l'appartement.
L'hôte est très sympathique (et il est français : très pratique pour communiquer), il est très facilement joignable.
Vous n'aurez aucune mauvaise surprise en louant cet appartement.[QWERTY123]Place looks like it does in the photos and is definitely in a great location, walking distance to meatpacking district, Chelsea markets, Greenwich village. There is a subway station on the corner and lots of food shops close by which is great.

The stairs up to the apartment are a bit of a hike and it is a bit loud...but I guess that's New York streets for you. There is aircon and wifi in the apartment which are needed when travelling. I stayed with 3 other girls, the bathroom was a bit tight but the rest of the house had enough room. The rooftop balcony is great, especially in summer!

Alexis was very helpful and responded quickly to all questions. Would recommend others to stay here.[QWERTY123]The location is perfect. We had a great time in NY. The apartment was clean and Alexis very helpful. We had no problems at all. All went very smoothly as always with Airbnb. This is the third time use this website.

Hugs from Iceland

Larus & family[QWERTY123]Great location and flat. Alexis was very professional and would thoroughly recomend staying here. Note though that bedroom is not seperated from the living area by a door so it's all open plan, although it is on an upper level[QWERTY123]Beautiful stay at Chelsea Terrace.
Perfect location, fast communication with Alex, all you can ask from an holiday...except the stairs...[QWERTY123]Great accommodations and great communication from Alexis. Easy to get to  via subway and plenty to do around the unit.[QWERTY123]very central, extremely clean and well presented terrace. enjoyed my stay in New York and would def go back in a heart beat.[QWERTY123]Clean, functional, superb downtown location.[QWERTY123]Great location and flat, clean, nice terrace, Alexis was great, I would definitely recommend staying here.[QWERTY123]Very clean, spacious and great location.[QWERTY123]La situación de este duplex es perfecta. Tiene una boca de metro al lado. Está muy cerca (para ir a pié) de zonas muy interesantes de restaurantes como Bleeker St. 100% recomendable.[QWERTY123]Quick answers, nice location and beautiful apartment. Thanks ++[QWERTY123]We stayed 4 fab nights at Alexis' apartment! Great location, fantastic roof terrace - where room for 4 people to eat dinner or breakfast was no problem.
Beds are good and space ok, the stairs up are ok - but guests needs to know that no lift available.
Close to subway and good restaurants very close by.
Would recommend this apartment to my friends and family any time!!
[QWERTY123]Had a great stay. 
Good communication with the host. Easy arrangements. Apartment is in perfect location. The place was clean and the facilities good.
i reccomend.[QWERTY123]Alexis was extremely helpful and always responded to emails promptly if we had a question about anything. The apartment was clean and definitely the right size for four people. The location is incredible. Maybe a little noisy - but you're in NYC, so who cares? There is a gorgeous outside terrace that overlooks the street and city - sunset bevvies anyone! Love it! Stay here. Also only a few minutes from Bleecker Street for the best shopping and coffee![QWERTY123]Great Location! Great communication with Alexis and fast responses. Love the terrace. 
[QWERTY123]This place is fantastic. Great spot on the north side of the west village towards Chelsea! The rooftop terrace is an amazing find and we absolutely loved our time there. Alexis was very accommodating because we needed an early check-in and he made this possible for us. The day-beds are very comfortable as is the bed upstairs. I don't have anything bad to say about this place and I hope to be back in the future.[QWERTY123]This is  beautiful apartment in a great location, and Alexis was an excellent host.  And the amazing roof deck makes it that much better.  Highly recommended on every level.[QWERTY123]This is a unique space in a great location.  Not noisy at all and great location for PATH train, subway, uptown and downtown access.  Meat packing district is two blocks away, very hip.  Alexis is a great host.  Be sure to be ready for the walk up with your bags.  Shower was great but needs a fix to the water temp.  I am sure the host will take care of that as he seems very responsive.  Terrace is not as big as in pics but awesome nonetheless.[QWERTY123]Location could not be better, a stone throw from Meatpacking district and subway to Central Park and Brooklyn right around the corner. The appartment has a fine terrace with BBQ. Communication with Alex went smooth. Higly recommended![QWERTY123]Plenty of room and great location. It is next to the station and many great clubs, bars and restaurants. Just be ready to climb up 5 flights of stairs as there is no elevator. It can get very stuffy too, but there are two air cons that work very well. The internet connection is really good too. Also, the hot water takes a while to function and it's New York so there is noise at all hours of the night, be prepared to sleep less and enjoy your stay! :)[QWERTY123]The apartment is exactly as appears in the photos and was certainly big enough for four of us to stay. The street is quite noisy but the location is very convenient for walking to Chelsea, or Greenwich  village,or union square and excellent subway access. The walk up is hard with bags, but you only have to do that once!  Alexis is prompt at replying to emails and checking and checkout were smooth, however we would have appreciated his fixing all the blown light bulbs.[QWERTY123]We stayed in Alexis flat around the weeks 41/42. Travelling all the ways from Denmark, we was exited if everything was as expected (especially the key exchange).
But I must say that there was absolutely no problem at all - everything went so smooth. The apartment was as expected. The whole Chelsea area is really a nice place, with nearby subways (north and south), a supermarket across the street, as well as a vine store down the street:-)
We will definitely recommend this place as a perfect base for a NY stay.[QWERTY123]I stayed at Alexis's apartment with three girlfriends for a weekend conference. We had a great time. The apartment was clean and well-maintained. Check-in and check-out were straight-forward. Alexis was professional and friendly--very easy to deal with.

We actually got stuck in NYC in the middle of Hurricane Sandy! We were all supposed to leave on Monday but the airports closed. Since no one else was staying in the apartment, Alexis let us extend our reservation by 2 days until we could fly out. We were so grateful for how easy he made it for us. Otherwise, I'm not sure what we would have done.

14th St is a little noisy. Just be aware that it's a busy street and Fri + Sat nights are loud. This is NYC, after all!

We LOVED the outdoor space and even had a few extra friends over for dinner one night. Such a great addition to the apartment.

The few neighbors we met were all friendly.

We would definitely stay here again![QWERTY123]great experience. no problems. super friendly host. great place. not noisy[QWERTY123]This is a very good location.  There is a great Italian restaurant just a few doors down and there is a market just a block and a half away that has everything you can imagine.  The apartment is very nice and comfortable. The only negative is the 5 story walk-up.  It is not convenient for anyone who cannot handle stairs.  Luggage was somewhat of a chore. We loved the outside patio![QWERTY123]El apartamento está muy bien, limpio y la situación es inmejorable. Todas las lineas de metro pasan muy cerca, e incluso se puede ir andando a las principales zonas de la ciudad.
[QWERTY123]appartement agérable, idéalement situé, en plein coeur de là où tout ce passe en ce moment à NY. nombreux restaurants, bars ou clubs très sympa à proximité. 
des stations de métro de chaque côté de la rue permettent de rayonner facilement dans la ville. 
[QWERTY123]Fantastic!  We stayed at Alexis apartment for a little over 5 weeks from late December 2012 through to the end of January 2013, and we throughly loved being able to call his apartment home.  His apartment offers views of NYC, is very secure and has plenty of kitchen utensils to allow for home cooking.  Although the kitchen (bench) space is rather limited, so cooking can be somewhat difficult - but still sufficient.

Alexis was a great host, who responded to all of our email queries very promptly.  The apartment is perfectly located to explore NYC with each of the boroughs only a short walk or subway ride away.  We had no problems at all with noise.  The only thing we would say is that this aparment complex does not have a lift and Alexis' place is on the top floor (5th), so be prepared to walk up and down the stairs each day. But in all honesty this is not an issue.     

But we loved this place and truly did not want to leave.  Based on our experience we would, without any doubt, recommend both Alexis as a host and this apartment.[QWERTY123]Perfect location, fantastic apartment. We loved our stay here and I'd definitely recommend it![QWERTY123]Great apartment. Amazing roof. Spacious and clean. Extra large bathroom too. Felt like home.[QWERTY123]We spent a great weekend in NYC. The appartment was perfect and the location is great.[QWERTY123]The location of Alexis' place is certainly one of the most convenient starting points to discover Manhattan. Meatpacking, Chelsea and the village are at 5 to 10 minutes walking distance and getting to midtown takes only 10 minutes by subway.
The apartment is cosy, arty and well furnished, perfect for a couple.
The terrace must be lovely during spring and summer as it was already very nice covered by snow!
Check in and check out went very easily thanks to Alexis' precise indications and his doorman just next door. 
Only point of improvement: the kind of old equipment such as heating and shower system would deserve a refreshment as well as the towels or the bed linen.
We have nevertheless spent a marvelous week in this apartment and would not hesitate one second renting it again.
[QWERTY123]Altogether a good stay in Alexis's apartment.
We couldn't enjoy the very nice terrace (it was too cold). The place is not so big so if you are more than 2 you have to be quite good friends,
before I arrive I forget about the stairs (there is no elevator) and it is at the 5th floor.
Otherwise very practical location on 14th street, very close to all subway stops. It is very easy to go anywhere from there.
Alexis's apartment was clean and fonctional.[QWERTY123]The apartment is super cute, and you really can't beat the location. My only complaint is that there was no hot water in the shower, which wasn't mentioned in the description.[QWERTY123]Quel emplacement ! Placé idéalement à Chelsea, ce petit duplex est entre deux métros (trois lignes) et à 5/10 minutes à pied de la High Line, du Chelsea Market, de Broadway et du quartier en plein développement de Meatpacking. Supermarché à proximité, caviste (pour trouver une bonne bouteille de vin), boutiques diverses, Starbuck pour ceux qui veulent y prendre leur petit-déjeuner pas loin... Idéal pour un couple ou avec deux enfants. Wifi nickel. 5e étage sans ascenseur, ce qui est courant pour New York et qui fait un bon échauffement avant de partir découvrir la ville. Appartement bien équipé avec terrasse dont on peut profiter dés les premiers rayons de soleil. Facile à trouver et tout a parfaitement bien fonctionné. Nous le conseillons vivement et nous y retournerons dés que possible tellement NYC est une ville magique ! Pierrick & Maud[QWERTY123]It´s a amazing place. Perfect location location, in the middle of all. The Terrace has a great view to enjoy the end of the day. The only incovinient is the stairs. If you plan shopping a lot, like us, thats will be a problem.[QWERTY123]Great Airbnb experience.  Alexis was a wonderful host and quick to answer all emails/ questions.  I would be so lucky if I got to stay here again.
The neighborhood couldn't be any better.  It is exactly where I would want to stay every time I worked in New York.
[QWERTY123]Alexis war immer erreichbar wenn man ihn brauchte. Es ist alles geregelt und sauber. Die Whg ist gross und perfekt für 1-2 Personen für einen längeren Aufenthalt. Die Küche ist super ausgestattet was für NYC speziell ist. Das Bad ist geräumig und es funktioniert alles. Der Balkon ist riesig und im Summer sehr angenehm und wie ein extra (Website hidden by Airbnb) hat genügend Bettwäsche,Tücher etc. man miss nichts extra kaufen/mitbringen. Wir haben die Zeit sehr genossen. Perfekt ist auch die Subway Anbindung. 1,2,3;4,5,6;L;A,B,C sind direkt vor der Türe. Auch 2 Supermärkte sowie CVS und Duane Read sind praktisch vor derTüre. Das YMCA ist auch in 5min Gehdistanz zu erreichen.[QWERTY123]We have been extremly happy with our stay in the apartement. Alexis was a very kind, forthcoming and responsible host and took care of all the problems we had during the whole stay. The location of the appartment was perfect, very central and in a very safe area! We can only recommend the appartment it was very cosy and the rooftop and its view are amazing! Nevertheless it was a little bit dusty and the apartement is smaller than it seems, however for 2 ppl it is perfect in terms of size! Thank you Alexis for the great time, and enjoy your stay everyone![QWERTY123]Brilliant apartment in a great neighbourhood – so much to do and see around the house even for a veteran NY visitor. The rooftop terrace is an amazing place to start the mornings, and the apartment is very well equipped for even a longer stay. We had plenty of space for three adults, and even the sofa beds are very comfortable for a good night's sleep. Checkin and checkout were very smooth thanks to a doorman in the building next door. Would definitely stay again![QWERTY123]The location was great! And the place was exactly as described. We would definitely stay here again.[QWERTY123]What a great place.  I was there in nice NYC weather and I think I spent more than half of my time out on the terrace.  And I couldn't believe how quiet it was even though it is on 14th Street.  Alexis was a great host answering questions for me during my stay.  It is on the fifth floor but the terrace makes it more than worth it.  I will definitely stay here again."	40.737767329788504	-74.00115257660775	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/19174	4	300.0	0.78
47	19282	"About the apartment: a gorgeous and really unique studio with room for 2 - 3 people to stay in comfortably. I loved the way she decorated it with bright yellow, vintage pieces and a great book collection. The bed is a little firm, but it didn't bother us. My favorite part was the roof top access - gorgeous for sunrises/ sunsets and a place to just relax! Really roomy and a nice, affordable space to rent. Neighborhood is not the best but it's still safe, plus it's really close to the subway station.

About the experience: Gaia was very nice and answered all messages quickly, which I appreciated. She tried to get us to pay an extra $100 at the end of our stay, which if we didn't damage anything, she would send back after our stay since she could not check us out - which was a downer. She didn't mention it at all in booking the place but thankfully, after meeting her, she didn't make us pay the fee. Overall, Gaia was helpful and welcoming.[QWERTY123]So glad I chose to stay here! The apartment was gorgeous, the neighbourhood was lovely and did I mention how fantastic the apartment was?? I wouldn't hesitate to book with Gaia again, she's a truly wonderful individual and you feel it from the good energy she has in her place. Anyone creatively inclined should stay here ;)[QWERTY123]I stayed at Gaia's apartment for one month and it was a great experience! Gaia was very helpful from the beginning on and stayed in contact with me over the whole time to make sure everything worked out. I travelled by ship and arrived two days earlier than expected, Gaia was so generous to add these days without charging anything.


When I arrived at the apartment everything was super clean, closets were empty, there were towels, bed linen etc. The apartment is really sunny and you have everything you need. The subway is close by, 3 minutes or so,  just a block away. Taking the B or Q train you can be in Manhattan in 20 minutes. 

Gaia clearly put great effort in designing the place, there's lots of great furniture around.

Overall, I can recommend this place to everyone wanting to stay in Brooklyn at a nice place![QWERTY123]Gaïa’s appartment is charming, spacious and very comfy. We spent two fabulous weeks in it. We have met Gaïa’s brother, who has been really kind and helpful. Before the trip, Gaïa sent us some advices to go from the airport to her home. She also explained everything we need to feel like home.
The neigbourhood is quiet and peaceful, the subway station really close to the appartment so we could easily come and go visiting everything we wanted.
We highly recommend Gaïa’s appartment to people who want to visit New-York city and to live the american way of life ! 
[QWERTY123]Nous avons séjourné 2 semaines chez Gaia et il n'y a rien a redire !! L'appartement est super, à moins de 5min du métro. Le voisinage est sympa de plus il y a un petit supermarché juste à coté, une pharmacie et un restaurant subway !! Concernant Gaia c'est une hôte très à l’écoute et attentif et gentille ! Elle donne tout ce qui est nécessaire pour pouvoir passé un bon séjour. C'est son frère qui nous a accueilli et il est très gentille. Je ne peut que vous la conseillé !![QWERTY123]We stayed for two nights at Gaia's lovely, spacious and sunny apartment.  The subway station & Prospect Park are a block away.  We would definitely do it again.[QWERTY123]We spent one week at Gaia's apartment. We went to NYC for work, and found her apartment to be the perfect place for us. It is very spacious and clean, it felt like an oasis in the middle of NY. 
The express Q train is 3 minutes from her house and commuting to Manhattan was super easy and convinient. I deffenitely recommend her apartment and I look forward to staying there again next time we will be in NYC.[QWERTY123]Apartment was in a very good location - close to subway.  A very good host.  Apartment has lots of sunshine with all the windows and was very  roomy.  It is kind of warm with all the sunshine coming in on the hot days of summer.  I would guess in the spring and fall the sunshine would be great!  Make sure you ask for the House Manual up front before you book.  This will tell you all you need to know about the cooling of the apartment.  There were 6 of us and it was unusually very hot in New York during our stay.  We were there 29 May - 3 Jun.  We did keep the air conditioners on Energy efficient but it was not that cool for us.  Maybe if the heat doesn't bother you it would be fine.  We had a great trip![QWERTY123]Gaia's place was great. Her Mom was very helpful getting us in and out for our stay. The apartment was well stocked with towels, and various things we needed. Was very clean and well kept. The hammock in the living room was a big hit with our teenage boy. Our younger son enjoyed cleaning up with the broom. The area was real nice, with easy walking to two different subway stations as well as Prospect Park, groceries, drug store, restaurants. Great stay![QWERTY123]Great apartment in a convenient location and would definitely stay there again.[QWERTY123]I can't really compare it to an apartment in New York, it is the only time we have been there. Older building and utilities. Books plentiful. Decent space (I think big for New York). It is not a hotel, but for a decent price it worked. Extremely close to transportation.[QWERTY123]Our stay at Gaia's place was wonderful.  Initially, we picked it for it's proximity to the park, the subway, and the culturally diverse neighborhood. We got so much more than we bargained for, however. Gaia's place was serene, sweet, and full of good energy. It felt like a second home and we were sad to leave.  I'm originally from Germany, have traveled extensively, and carry many of those experiences wherever I go. Being in Gaia's place reminded me of where I have been and where I still wish to go. I realize this is a bit of a poetic review, but I wanted to communicate how much my sons and I enjoyed our stay.

Cerca del metro y con muchas soluciones gastronomicas muy cerca. Ambiente familiar en la casa y en el barrio. Adam y Charity fueron muy amables y estaban ahi presentes para cualquier necesidad.[QWERTY123]This place is great if your looking to blend in with the local charm. Our hosts were very accommodating and even gave us some great tips on local spots. 

Parking wasn’t too bad on the nearby streets either. 

[QWERTY123]This is a very cute little apartment close to the Nostrand stop on the blue line. The apartment is very spacious for a 1 bed and was perfect for my husband and I and our 11 month old baby. Adam and Charity kindly supplied us with a crib for the baby. The neighborhood is full of beautiful brownstones and Nostrand ave has a couple of small grocery stores just 5 minutes walk away. We didn’t explore the neighborhood much as we headed to the waterfront each day. It’s just a short ride on the subway to downtown Brooklyn and amazing views of Manhattan. We recommend Brooklyn Bridge Park, part of which had just opened when we visited so we pretty much had the entire park to ourselves.[QWERTY123]very nice basement apartment with lots of space and light! Great host! nice neighborhood![QWERTY123]I'm so happy we chose this Airbnb.  Adam and Charity are wonderful hosts.  
 Communication before and during the visit was quick, kind and always helpful.  The place is so lovely and spacious, and the decor and art are really terrific.  The bedroom is enormous!  The location is an easy walk to great bars, restaurants, and subway stations.   I will recommend this Airbnb to my friends and family in the future![QWERTY123]We had a terrific stay in Brooklyn! The apartment is thoughtfully decorated and had everything we could need and more. Adam was easy to get in touch with for any questions we had and gave us some great restaurant recommendations. It was a hot couple of days when we visited and the A/C units were a godsend after walking around all day. The subway was a quick walk for our trips into Manhattan and the neighborhood felt safe and had plenty of options for dining and groceries. Highly recommend this Airbnb![QWERTY123]I spent a week at Adam and Charitys place and it was quite lovely, thoughtfully decorated and really comfortable - the perfect first stop on my NYC tour. The bedroom is gorgeous and the bed comfortable. The kitchen was really useful and has everything you could possibly need to cook a meal. The backyard was stupendous with seating and a lush grassy yard. I had a couple of friends over for a dinner party and it was perfect. The location is in a beautiful part of Crown Heights, with close proximity to the express train to Manhattan. I would most certainly stay here again![QWERTY123]Location was perfect, loved the home. I would recommend people to stay here, Adam and Charity's place is wonderful.[QWERTY123]Traditional Brownstone apartment , well located near the A,C subway. Cute backyard and outdoor dining. Nice facilities, Adam and Charity very are accommodating hosts.[QWERTY123]Great spot in Brooklyn. Extremely comfortable bed and couch. Great space for a small family![QWERTY123]If you love old houses as I do you'll love this place! It was spacious and as shown in the pictures. With a kid Netflix was a great bonus! Big recommendations to Adam and Charity and their lovely place.[QWERTY123]Excelente. Fue mas de lo que esperabamos. Tanto Adam como Charity nos hicieron sentir muy cómodos desde el primer día. El apartamento tiene mucho más de lo que uno necesita. Están en todos los detalles (sobre todo en los importantes). Una casa hermosa y muy limpia que nos otorgó privacidad, comodidad, confort y en un vecindario tranquilo y amigable.  LO RECOMIENDO A TODA LA COMUNIDAD DE AIRBNB. VOLVERIAMOS SIN DUDARLO.[QWERTY123]Adam & Charity were great hosts!  They were very quick to respond with helpful tips to our tourist questions. Beautiful, large space near the LIRR and subway.  If you want to add a little Brooklyn to your NYC trip, this is a great spot at a great price![QWERTY123]Es un apartamento agradable con una buena ubicación en Brooklyn. Adam y Charity amables y con buena disposición.[QWERTY123]Great space with everything you can possibly need during your stay. Adam and Charity were super accommodating and helpful in guiding us to local kid-friendly spots. We felt very comfortable and at home. Will definitely be guests again when in NY![QWERTY123]Adam and Charity were the most kind and welcoming hosts! The space was much larger than we expected and was very clean, comfortable, and tastefully decorated. We felt very much like it was home away from home. The house is perfectly situated in Brooklyn - super close to subway lines to and from Manhattan, and the light rail LIRR (perfect if you're coming in from JFK airport). It was perfect for us who didn't want to stay in the middle of the hustle and bustle of Manhattan. The neighborhood itself was very clean and safe, and we didn't have to walk far for amazing local restaurants and shops. We highly recommend Adam and Charity's beautiful home to anyone who wishes to visit NYC!"	40.67591925867425	-73.94693876990418	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/7726	3	99.0	0.857143
49	19319	"Ana was very friendly and warm and her apt was clean, comfortable and easy. I really enjoyed my stay at her Lower East Side apt.  I highly recommend staying at Ana's![QWERTY123]Ana and Kathie are very sweet hosts and I had a great time staying at their apartment.  I was very grateful for their kind hospitality when my luggage didn't arrive with me!  They even loaned me clothes while my luggage went missing.  

This was my first airbnb experience and I'm very happy with my stay at their place.  Their apartment was indeed clean and the room spacious and comfortable.  The air conditioning was great too, in the middle of a NY heat wave!
[QWERTY123]Ana's place had a great view, an easy walk to the subway, and a really good pizza place nearby (Frank and Toms). Ana and Kathie were great hosts with a lot of information. I was given access to their internet and a map of Manhattan. 2 of the most important and useful things in my trip. My only regret is not spending more time with her. If I'm ever in the area again I'd definitely stay with her again (if she lets me of course!)[QWERTY123]Ana is a very friendly host and is very responsive to my inquiries. Her place is at a great location, which is at the eastern part of lower Manhattan and is easily accessible to the places of interest if you are in NY for holiday. If you are looking for a nice, amicable and quiet place with privacy, this is the place![QWERTY123]I had a really great time at Ana and Kathie's place. The apartment was nice and clean, and very well located in Manhattan. They made myself feel at home!.[QWERTY123]Staying with Ana and Kathie was awesome.  Not only is the place exactly as what you see in the pictures but they are also really lovely people to stay with.  It was an excellent 1st airbnb experience.[QWERTY123]My girlfriend and I stayed for 10 days at this place, and really, we loved it. Even if the highway is a little bit too close...i think you wont be in NY to stay in an appartment…it's (Website hidden by Airbnb) execpt this detail, it's a lovely place, subway very close, safe neighborhood, a great view on the Manhattan Bridge and Brooklyn…

Ana and Kathie are very cool people, if you need something, they will help you with smile !
They will tell you where to take a good ""Romeo & Juliet Breakfast"" :)[QWERTY123]ANA IS A VERY WELCOMING, CHARMING AND HELPFUL HOST.  WE WERE VERY COMFORTABLE IN HER HOME.[QWERTY123]Ana was a great hostess. She gave us great directions to her home, was waiting for us when we arrived. She gave us great information about the city, where to eat, where to go out and had lots of maps and books for us to look at. Ana was also very sweet and let us use her kitchen to make food and allowed me to use her computer whenever I needed it. The apartment has a great location - very close to downtown, Brooklyn (the bridge is very nice to walk across), the river walk on the west of Manhattan, the financial district, etc. etc. It is walking distance from the metro, and I felt very safe at night too! There is also a bike rental shop very close to her place which I would suggest to anyone!
I would stay with Ana again if I came to NYC and I will definitely suggest her place to any of my friends if they go. Thank you again Ana! You are always welcome to stay with me if you ever come to Tennessee!! :) Thanks for everything - you were very sweet with us. Antonio and I enjoyed our stay very much. Wish we could have seen you more![QWERTY123]Ana was a great hostess, friendly and warm.  I felt very comfortable in her apartment, super nice and clean. She made myself feel at home. 

Metro is 2 blocks away and takes you everywhere. The neighborhood is very well located

The place has a great view !! is peaceful and save !
Ana thanks for everything ! 
[QWERTY123]Ana was very considerate in meeting us at the apartment upon our arrival.  She had several suggestions and maps that were available to us and suggestions on where to eat nearby.  Her recommendation on taxi service was also helpful especially upon our departure so that we could order the night before.  Although my friend was aware of the traffic outside, it didn't bother me at all.  I would suggest that if you are staying with a friend (other than a spouse or partner) be sure to book the queen room.  The room and bath were very clean and she was kind about offering the use of her kitchen.  All in all is was a pleasant experience.[QWERTY123]Ana and Katie are great hostess. They made me feel at home.
Katie was very helpful with locations, directions and how to travel in NYC.
Extremely clean and warming. I´ll choose this apt again if I´ll ever come back to NYC.
Thanks girls![QWERTY123]Ana was a great host during my visit. I really appreciated her warm welcome and attention to making me feel at home. Thanks Ana![QWERTY123]I ended up staying with Ana and Kathie for over a month!  They were wonderful hosts and roommates.  There were some days when they were out late but when they were home they were really friendly and fun to hang out with.  Overall the bedroom and also entire apartment is quiet, clean, and really comfortable.

The neighborhood is close to a lot of stuff -- Chinatown, Little Italy and the Lower East Side.  The apartment is also close the F train so you can get to just about anywhere in Manhattan and to Brooklyn quite easily.

Overall highly recommended.  I'd definitely recommend this apartment to friends.[QWERTY123]Anna is super host. Everything was amazing.  Her restorant choice is wonderful.
Thanks many times.[QWERTY123]Me and my brother really appreciated our staying there. Ana and her roomate Kathie are kind and helpful. 
the room was fine for 2 people, clean and with a great view of the Manhattan and Brooklyn bridge.
The lower east side is a great place to be.
[QWERTY123]We stayed at Ana and Kathie's for six days in a private bedroom. Before we arrived, Ana was very helpful with all the information we needed before we came. We got our own key and could come and go as we liked. The bedroom was perfect, with perfect view!! Kitchen and bathroom was very clean and tidy, and we could make our own food if we wanted to. We could also use the rest of the apartment as we liked. We got a lot of nice tips regarding where to eat and where to go, and all the places were great! We really recommend this great apt, great location and great girls!
Thank you Ana and Kathie![QWERTY123]Ana and Kathie were great! The apartment was very clean and in good area. They were very helpful with alot of information on NYC and made us feel very welcome. Thanks guys![QWERTY123]Ana is a great host! Her apartment was the perfect place to stay for our first trip to New York City!!! We spent an amazing week in this great place.The apartment was at a very convenient location, and also very nicely and comfortably furnished, and the view was breathtaking!!! We would recommend Ana as a host to anyone, she is very outgoing and extremely helpful. Thank You Ana![QWERTY123]Excellent stay in every aspect. Ana was super nice in assisting with move in and the neighborhood. The apartment was clean and tidy, I had a great time. Would recommend it to anyone coming to NYC![QWERTY123]I had a great stay at Ana and Kathie's lovely apartment in the lower east side. The room is clean as well as the rest of the apartment. I had access to everything I needed. I had to shorten my stay due to some unexpected traveling issues. They we very kind about alterations I had to make to my reservation. The view is also lovely just like you see in the pictures. This was my first airbnb experience and it will not be my last. I would love to book with Kathie and Ana  again in my future trips to NY. I felt very comfortable throughout this experience. All in all Great host ! :)[QWERTY123]This home is a real gem in NYC - absolutely stunning. I've lived in Manhattan for 9 years, so I have to say to anyone visiting, this is about as perfect a way to do the island as you can imagine. Spectacular views from the rooms and balcony, a beautiful home, and steps away from the F train. There's some road noise, but on the eighth floor it's quite manageable. And Ana and her roommate Kathy were wonderful, absolutely flexible and friendly and the ideal airbnb hosts.[QWERTY123]The stay at Ana and Kathie's place was excellent and we highly recommend their place to anyone who likes to visit NYC!
Ana and Kathie's place is big enough not to get in each others way, but if you need anything (advice, tips, etc) they are always there to support you.
The apartment is clean and the room is simply brilliant! It is big, has a great bed and you will have the best view of both the Manhattan and the Brooklyn Bridge right out of your bedroom window.
Especially in the morning, with the rising sun, the views are stunning.
The walk to the East Broadway stop on the F-line takes about 3 minutes and takes you to midtown in about 15 minutes.
If you need to go anywhere else you can switch trains on a number of stations easily.[QWERTY123]This is as good as it gets!  This is my first experience with the airbnb.com community.  I have been blown away by the quality of the service and level of communication from both the administrative side and by my hostess, Ana. Ana and Kathie were both very responsive to my emails before my arrival to NY.  We arrived early before they got off work, but Ana got her girlfriend to come over to open the door for us. Their apartment is in a secured building located in a safe neighborhood with a great view of the waterfront and bridges.  The room was comfortable with a/c. Their location is so convenient to getting around Manhattan either by subway or walking.
Ana is a great person. She loves sharing her favorite places and eating hang-outs.  She had very good non-touristy recommendations.  She always was available to us if any questions or issues arose.  Don’t ever hesitate to rent from Ana and Kathie!  If I am in NY again, I would do it again in a heartbeat!
Even the airbnb.com administrative contacts were great.  I had a billing issue that I called in the middle of the evening and they had someone resolve it immediately!  That’s impressive!
[QWERTY123]We had a great stay at Ana and Kathy's place.  They were both really nice to talk to, and were very helpful in answering all of our questions.  
The room is really big, and could easily fit two persons and has a great view. We were free to use the kitchen supplies and the fridge during our stay, which we often did. The apartment is located near a subway station which will take you where ever you need to go when you visit NY. 
We would definitely stay there again :-)[QWERTY123]I stayed one week with my girlfriend at Ana and Kathie's and it was absolutely brilliant!


Ana and Kathie were really kind and they are the best hostess that we've ever met. The appartment was really cossy and very clean. It is really close to the subway and the views from the balcony are amazing. We recommend to walk from the apartment to the Pier 17, the views of Brooklyn are fantastic. And don't hesitate to ask them to recommend you a place to eat or places to visit, they are really helpful!!!

We felt like at home, and if we go back to NY (we will for sure!) we will stay there again!

Muchas gracias por todo chicas![QWERTY123]We had THE BEST TIME in NY and and we very much enjoyed staying with Ana and Kathie. We had 18 fantastic days and they were wonderful hosts who made us so welcome and comfortable. They were always willing to answer our many questions about New York. Their home is very clean and the room is spacious and the view was spectacular, especially at sunset. It is very close to the subway and we would uptown in no time. We loved the easy access to Brooklyn. We also really enjoyed staying in the neighbourhood. We felt if we had stayed in a hotel in midtown, we would not have had the experience of viewing life on the LES. We have already recommended them to people back home and will continue to do so any chance we get. We would love to stay in their apartment again, in fact we wish we were still there!  We just loved it and honestly wouldn't have changed a thing. Thanks girls for everything.[QWERTY123]Very nice apartment, and me and my wife are very hapy to stayed there, because everthing was perfect for us. Ana and Kathie have a nice place to stay in NY. We liked a lot...
Thank you Kathie and Ana[QWERTY123]Ana’s apartment was a great find! It is clean, comfortable, and in a great location.  It was very straightforward communicating with her at every step of the airbnb process.  The wifi connection was super-fast and there were no issues with heating/cooling – two things I super-appreciate after having issues at other places.  In a great neighborhood and very close and convenient to subways to get to wherever you need to go in NYC. 

[QWERTY123]We had a wonderful time by Ana and Kathie. We were over 4 weeks there. Ana and Kathie have been great hosts. They showed us the neighborhood and gave us many tips. The apartment was very clean and our bedroom was very confortable. If we come again to New York, we would stay by Ana&Kathie :)
Thanks a lot and take care,
Tamara&Martin[QWERTY123]My NY home:)
I stayed at Ana and Kathie´s for 6 weeks. And i would be happy to stay longer:)
The communication with them from the beginning was really good - they were clear and made me feel safe and welcome. I did not have many questions, because Ana and Kathie were always ahead of me giving me info on how to find the building and how to orientate myself. And they continued being great all through my stay:) 
The apartment is clean and just like the pictures. Ana and Kathie are really nice, warm, easy going, clean and respectful people. 
The building itself is in a very nice area - overlooking the bridges.( And the doormen are really nice to)
The place is really close to everything and the Metro station. In a safe and calm area.
I will come back to Ana and Kathie if i go back to NY, and i warmly reccomend them as hosts!![QWERTY123]Ana and her flatmate Kathie are awesome hosts! They made our stay in NYC comfortable. The apartment has a great view and its very clean. 
[QWERTY123]Ana was an absolutely great host.  She made it easy for me to get the keys to the apartment after my flight arrived in New York.  I stayed her apartment for 5 days.  She provided me with a clean and spacious room for New York standards.  I really appreciated the fact that the building had several elevators ( I did not want to walk up multiple flights of stairs with all my luggage) and the room had an air conditioning.  The apartment was also very close to the subway (about a 5 min walk.)

I was traveling alone and Ana was kind enough to invite me along with her and her friends to walk around DUMBO and Williamsburg and I joined them for lunch.  She made me feel very comfortable and was extremely warm and kind.  I enjoined getting to know her and her friends.  

I would highly recommend staying with them anytime and would do so again in a heartbeat if I were back in New York again.
[QWERTY123]Hello everyone. I stayed at Ana's place at NYC and had a great time. Everything worked out perfect and the rom was big and clean. The only not so good thing is, that it is sometimes at night kind of loud because the FDR is passing right besides the house.[QWERTY123]We had a wonderful time at Ana's during our stay.  She was very helpful and both Dan and I felt at home in their home.[QWERTY123]My stay at Ana's  place was very relaxed. She makes you feel welcome and comfortable from the beginning and she is very responsive to all mails and questions you have. Everything said in all these positive reviews are just true and the room is exactly as advertised. No need to say more.[QWERTY123]These girls are best! Stop looking if you plan to stay near the downtown.

The view is definitely spectacular, bridges is the first thing you see in the morning. The building is on the FDR, a little down from the Chinatown. 15 minutes up will bring you to the Little Italy, another 15 minutes up and right and you'll be in the East Village with its cafes and atmosphere.

Metro station is two blocks away, F line goes straight to Empire State Building and Central Park. Everything is pretty accessible.

The only drawback is that the place a little bit noisy in the night due to cars passing on the road, so if you're looking for a quiet park experience, you won't find it. But this is NY, and we were quite comfortable with it.

Don't forget to feed squirrels near the building.[QWERTY123]Ha sido una muy grata experiencia el alojarnos durante nuestra estadia en NY en lo de Ana y Kathie. Ambas nos supieron guiar por la inmensa new york sin ningun inconveniente pudiendo asesorarnos para tomar el subte o cualquier medio de transporte de forma eficaz, conocer los barrios y sus secretos y poder exprimir cada dia de nuestro viaje. La vista es espectacular desde la ventana pudiendo ver el rio, los puentes de Brooklin, Manhattan y Williamsburg. El departamento esta a 2 cuadras del subte y uno puede ir caminando y en pocos minutos ir a cualquier parte de downtown. Muy recomendable y pára nuestro proximo viaje ni me preocupo por buscar otro lugar![QWERTY123]Not even hurricane Sandy could upset a wonderful stay at Ana and Kathy's place! The apartment is very conveniently located within walking distance of many NY attractions, and has beautiful views right from the balcony. Extremely friendly, helpful and relaxed host that made our time spent there a pleasure. I'd gladly recommend it to anyone that is interested![QWERTY123]Buena gente, acogedor, bien equipado, cama comoda, ducha fuerte, vista y balcón estupendos, cerca del metro.. una estancia muy agradable.

Nice people, welcoming, well-equipped, comfy bed, good strong shower, fantastic view and balcony, near the subway.. a very pleasant stay.[QWERTY123]This was my first stay with any bnb.  It turned out to be a great experience.  Both Ana and her roommate Kathie made me feel right at home, and any apprehension I had quickly disappearred.  Both made me feel welcome and I felt very comfortable, talking or even watching TV with them.  They also acted as great tour guides directing me to the right subways, giving me excellent directions and providing me with the phone number to a car service.  The apartment was very clean and my accommodations were very comfortable.  I couldn't have had a better vacation.  Looking forward to doing it again.[QWERTY123]Ana&Kathie was two wonderful host and their apartment is very comfortable. The apartment had everything we needed and their neighborhood is very authentic NYC. The view from the room is so cute, bridge is the first thing you see in the morning and the last thing you go to bed. Metro station is two blocks away, F line goes straight to Empire State Building and Central Park. Our only regret was not having more days to enjoy :)
[QWERTY123]This was my 2nd stay with Airbnb and Ana&Kathie was two wonderful host, their apartment is very comfortable, very close to Chinatown with a spectacular view on the Manhattan Bridge and the skyline behind. The subway is only two blocks away, it's really easy to reach mainly all NY attractions, even by foot. (harbour is 20 minutes, wall, street 15 min etc.).  I'd gladly recommend it to anyone staying there in NYC.[QWERTY123]Perfect place to stay in NY. katie and Ana were so nice. Lot of advice and help to visit NY. Lot of attentions (like coffee in the morning, umbrella when its raining). Flat really clean and beautiful (very nice view on the Manhattan and Brooklyn Bridge). Its better to travel like that and specially at their place, because you share something more[QWERTY123]We had a lovely time staying at Ana's. The room was pleasant and comfortable, location convenient, everything is as described. We were looked after mainly by Ana's friend Victoria who was so kind, helpful and charming. Would recommend Ana's place to anyone.

Niamh & Thomas[QWERTY123]Ana and Kathie are wonderful people and they made it an absolute pleasure to stay with them. The house is light and clean and it is pretty easy to get to anything with a subway station right near by. 
Thanks guys!![QWERTY123]El depto está buenísimo y tiene todas las comodidades que necesitas para pasar unos días de vacaciones a gusto y tranquilos. La ubicación es excelene para acceder a cualquier lugar facilmente.
Las anfitrionas te hacen sentir muy cómoda la estadía y muy buenos los consejos que nos dieron para conocer la ciudad.[QWERTY123]I have felt so comfortable at Ana's and Kathie's place. The two are really hospitable and I enjoyed living there a lot! Besides that the apartement is very clean and the room looks just like in the pictures and provides plenty of space for lugagge. 
I couldn't have imagined any better place to stay in NY or any better hosts :)
Besos ![QWERTY123]The perfect place to stay in NY. Kathie and Ana were so nice. The room is very comfortable, great location and everything is as described and also they had a great view, and is very easy walk to the subway to go anywere. We recommend Ana's place to anyone. It was a pleasure to stay with Ana & Kathie. Pablo y Romina

[QWERTY123]I would have to say this was my best Airbnb experience! Thanks to Ana and Kathie for being the perfect hosts and making this stay very comfortable and enjoyable. I made this booking at the last minute and as soon as my request was accepted Ana was in constant contact with me and was easy to reach whenever I had any questions to ask. The whole apartment was very clean with a lot of light and even has a balcony which you can just sit back and enjoy the view. The bedroom was big enough to accommodate my things and the bed itself was very comfortable and you also get a great view of the Manhattan Bridge from your window. The nearest subway station was 2 blocks away and was very easy to get to. I considered the surrounding neighbourhood to be very safe also. I would definitely consider booking this place again when I visit New York!!! :))[QWERTY123]We loved staying with Ana. The apartment is big, nice and clean - and the location is great. Walking distance to all of Lower Manhattan and close to the Metro. 
Ana is a great host, that know how to balance the privacy of the gusts and still being a great host! We can warmly recommend staying here![QWERTY123]The place is exactly as it is in the pictures, big, nice, and clean, located only a few blocks from the metro station.  Ana is a great host in constant communication before arrival and during the stay to make sure we felt comfortable. A very positive experience![QWERTY123]The view is so amazing, and the location is great - a short walk to all of the best lower east side bars and food. Would highly recommend. We were out late and Ana had left before we got up most mornings so hardly saw her, but was a brilliant host! Made our time in NYC very special.[QWERTY123]Ana and Kathie, our two hosts welcomed us warmly and they offered their help in any situation needed! My friend and I felt comfortable from the first second on. The bed was super cozy and everything in the apartment was clean. Using the metro you get easily to any point in Manhattan aswell as in Brooklyn. We can totally recommend staying here![QWERTY123]My friend and I stayed with Ana and Kathie for almost three weeks. Both Ana and Kathie were more than accomodating and made both our transitions from moving from Australia to New York that little bit easier. The apartment was clean, the bedroom was cosy and the bed was incredibly comfortable, warm & perfect for a long days end. They helped with directions, places to eat, places to go and always answered any questions we had. We moved to New York not knowing many people and now have two more friends! Thankyou Ana & Kathie x[QWERTY123]I spent one week at Kathie and Ana's apartment. They are extremely welcoming and make you feel at home since the very first day. They gave me a lot of tips for NYC sightseeing and shopping. It was a pleasure staying at their place and will come again for sure in the future. Thanks Kathie and Poni![QWERTY123]Ana was a great host! the bedroom is perfect and the view from the balcony cannot be beat.[QWERTY123]I just came back from a 6 day trip to New York staying in Ana's appartment. She's been a wonderful host. The appartment is great. Conveniently located in the East Village, two blocks away of the F metro line, which allows easy access to all Manhattan, brooklyn and the airport. The room was exactly as it is shown in the pictures, with a great view of both the Manhattan and Brooklyn bridges. Thanks Ana for everything. Happy New Year!!!! Alba & Èlia.
[QWERTY123]We enjoyed our stay here very much. Nice girls in every way, and very helpful.

We loved the view to the bridge, and the traffic noise isn't bad at all (same as rest of NYC). Bedroom was nice and heated.

Very nice stay. Do recommend!![QWERTY123]Great location, Ana and Kathie are so friendly![QWERTY123]I had a really good time at Ana and Kathie's place. They were very welcoming and helpful. I felt like I was part of the family with them. The appartment was clean, roomy and had an awesome view if the Brooklyn bridge. I'd be very happy to stay with them again.[QWERTY123]Ana and Cathie were wonderful hosts.  Very friendly.  The room was clean and nice and the view of the east river and brooklyn bridge was awesome! I I will definitely look forward to stay with them next time I am in New York![QWERTY123]Ana and Kathie were very nice and respectful. Responded promptly to all of my questions. The apartment is very clean, the room has a lot of space and the bathroom was also very clean.[QWERTY123]I stayed with a friend at Ana and Kathie's for 9 days. We had a great time! The view on the bridge is amazing, especially during the night. The apartment was very clean and the room very well heated (outside the temperature was -2). The room is exactly how we saw in the photos. Unfortunately I met Ana only the last day, we spend the rest of the days with other two really nice guys. But Ana answered all of my questions immediately by phone and she left us a map of the city :) Hope to see them all again.[QWERTY123]Ana was an excellent host right from the start!  We flew into Newark and she provided great directions for us to get to the apartment via bus then subway.  Upon arrival, she briefed us on all we needed to know about the apartment, the building, getting around, and the area (including recommendations on places to eat).  She also made herself available to us throughout the trip to answer questions or address needs as they arose. 

The room was perfect!  It had a great view and plenty of closet space for our stuff.  The bed was comfortable and we felt right at home.  

Our room was located directly across from the bathroom, which was nice and very clean.  In fact, Ana's place is very tidy.  The balcony is great, and had it been warmer, we would have spent more time out there.  She was also very hospitable in offering us anything we needed (soaps, towels, coffee).

I would highly recommend Ana's place to friends going to NYC.  This was our first time doing air bnb and we had a great experience with it.  Ana is a great host!![QWERTY123]Ambas anfitrionas (Ana y Kathie) muy buena onda, con mucha disposición para ayudarnos y darnos los mejores datos para conocer mejor la ciudad y el barrio. Como por ejemplo nuestro lugar favorito ""Cafe Petisco"".
El barrio muy comodo, accesible, cercano a todo.
El departamento con increíble vista a Brooklyn y los tres puentes que conectan manhattan con este.
Las fotos publicadas describen muy bien el departamento, la pieza, baño y lugares comunes perfectos, todo muy limpio.
Todo esto hizo que nuestra estadía fuera perfecta.

100% recomendable.
Esperamos volver :))
Alvaro y Maida.

[QWERTY123]Hemos pasado una hermosa estadia con mi amiga, nos hospedamos diez dias y nos sentimos como en nuestra casa. Ana nos recomendo como movernos por la ciudad y que lugares visitar. Ademas nos facilito horarios de llegada y salida. El departamento es muy comodo, la cama amplia, con una vista privilegiada del puente Manhattan y el rio. El barrio es muy tranquilo y  familiar, volviamos tarde por la noche sin problemas, los bares de East Village estan cerca, ademas la estacion del subte f queda a pocas cuadras y recorre toda la ciudad. Tanto Ana como Kathie estaban poco en la casa, nos moviamos con mucha independencia, hay varios lugares cerca para comer y un mercado muy completo en la esquina. Nuestra estadia no podria haber sido mejor, muy recomendable, recorrimos toda Manhattan y volveriamos a elegir este lugar y Lower East Side![QWERTY123]Ana e Kathie são ótimas. Respeitosas e muito educadas. Me senti em casa o tempo todo tanto no quarto, quanto na sala, na cozinha e na varanda que é maravilhosa, com uma vista lindíssima. Elas ficam pouco em casa e, quando estão, oferecem prioridade ao hóspede. A localização é perfeita, com comércio barato no entorno e a poucas quadras de excelentes restaurantes e museus de ny. O metrô é muito perto e pode-se fazer tudo a pé. O Brooklyn é logo ali, do outro lado da ponte que se pode ver da janela. Definitivamente ficaria no apartamento de novo. Um abraço forte, Ana e Kathie. Espero vê-las novamente em breve.[QWERTY123]It was very nice to stay at Ana's. Very close to the subway station. And at night,very fascinating view of the Manhattan bridge.[QWERTY123]Lovely hosts, good advice and recommendations provided. Good size, clean room  :)[QWERTY123]El dpto. es muy cómodo y amplio, tal cual lo muestra en la foto. Está cercano a la línea de subte entonces es fácil para llegar a todos lados. Ana es muy amable y atenta. Todas las preguntas que teníamos ella trataba de resolverlas o se fijaba en su celu!! Pero lo importante es que es muy cordial y de mucha ayuda si es que no tenés bien en claro la movida de NY.[QWERTY123]Ana warmly greeted me on the day I moved in. The whole living experience was excellent, as the hosts were really friendly and they even showed me how to use the washer and dryer downstairs. The bed is very comfy and the shower is perfect (I mean it!). The location is very close to the financial district, and there are many restaurants nearby. Definitely recommend this listing to all:)[QWERTY123]Staying at Ana's place was a great experience, since I've never shared an apartment before. I usually stay in hotels, but this time I've decided to change, since the reviews for Ana and Kathie were the best.
Well, let me describe my experience...
My business partner picked me up at the airport and we headed to Ana's place, getting there Ana was waiting for me, she is a beautiful sweet girl, wanted to help me with my heavy luggage (of course I didn't let her help), she show me the room where I would stay for 5 days and 4 nights. The apartment is cozy, clean and the shower is wonderful, actually is more a water massage than a shower, due to the water pressure. The apartment's view is amazing, I woke up in the morning with the view of Manhattan and Brooklyn Bridges and the sunset shining bright, simply awesome. I also had the opportunity to meet Ana's Dad, an experienced gentleman with vast culture, both of us spoke Portuguese (my native language) and Spanish. The best thing was to exchange life experiences, with nice and educated people.
I definitely recommend staying at Ana's place. Thank you Ana and Kathie for a memorable experience. God bless you girls![QWERTY123]Muy bien todo, muchas gracias a Kathi por las instrucciones. Recomendable 100%.[QWERTY123]Ana y Kathie fueron unas excelentes anfitrionas. Muy buena predisposición y atención para coordinar la llegada al departamento y también me ayudaron en el momento del traslado al aeropuerto con el transfer. Me asesoraron y aconsejaron sobre lugares para visitar. La vista de la habitación y del balcón es increíble. La descripción y las fotos son iguales a la publicación. El sector de uso compartido es muy cómodo. Un plus extra, importante para mi es qué también hablan español. Cuando vuelva a NY vuelvo a rentar la habitación de Ana y Kathie.[QWERTY123]Ana and Kathi are the best Airbnb hosts I've ever had. Both were so accommodating in sharing their space with me for a month. The apartment was super warm during the winter, had a very functional kitchen and laundry in the building (which we all know is a luxury in New York!) It's a 7 minute walk to the East Broadway F line, which allowed easy access to midtown, where I was attending design school. Thank you so much, Ana and Kathi![QWERTY123]Great place, great views, very clean, description very precise, great hosts, very relaxed: just a great experience!![QWERTY123]I was apprehensive about booking a private room for the first time as opposed to an entire apartment, but Ana was an amazing host and the apartment was very clean. She was kind, welcoming, and even allowed us an early check-in because we had an early arrival into Newark. I appreciated her recommendations to visit certain spots. She was always happy to answer any questions regarding transportation and different neighborhoods.

The apartment was very clean and the bed was comfy. The view of the two bridges was spectacular and great to wake up to before heading out.

The location is as advertised LES with quick access to the F.[QWERTY123]The apartment is big by Manhattan standard. Clean. Bed is comfortable. Especially if you're a side sleeper. View from balcony (yes there's a balcony) was absolutely breath taking. Location is near Deli variety stores, as well as the best restaurant meal we had (thanks to Kathy & Anna's recommendations). We were comfortable using washroom, kitchen, and dining area. Hosts were easily reachable through (Hidden by Airbnb) or Airbnb, which is especially convenient because we did not have US Cell phones lines, but could still reach them through street Wifi. Hosts were typically working or out, so gave us more privacy than we expected given it was shared apartment. But we had our room anyway. Location was near subway, but we realized that anywhere in Manhattan was. The neighborhood was not posh by any means, and the people on the streets were nice and we felt safe walking at night at any time.[QWERTY123]This apartment is literally perfect. Super clean, great location, and very spacious.[QWERTY123]Ana & Kathie have been fantastic in every aspect. Never met two hosts like this before. Great sense of humor and always helpful with great NYC recommendations. Thank you for making me feel at home![QWERTY123]Tal cual.[QWERTY123]Anna was such a warm and friendly host. The apartment is cozy and clean. The view is incredible too, I truly enjoyed my stay![QWERTY123]Idéalement placé avec une vue sur Manhattan Bridge, à 30 minutes de marche de Soho et du financial district, métro à 5 min[QWERTY123]Heel erg fijn appartement. Gieie locatie, heel dicht bij een metro station van de F train. 
Ana en Kathie zijn super aardig en maken graag een praatje. Alles was netjes. I raad de plek zeker aan![QWERTY123]I stayed at Ana and Kathies apartment for three months. I can highly recommend this place especially for longer stays because you'll feel like staying at home. Ana and Kathie were always friendly and answered me all my questions. They are probably the best Airbnb hosts in New York.
The apartement was always clean. The room is very huge related to the standards in New York and the bed is very comfy and soft.
The Lower East Side is one of the best neighborhoods in Manhattan and I always felt safe there. 
I would choose Ana and Kathies Airbnb again.[QWERTY123]老实说房间外面有一条快速路,即使关上窗户也还是有点点噪音,如果是睡眠不好的人可能会有影响,但是对于我来讲完全不是问题｡而且我很喜欢Ana和她的朋友,她们真是非常棒的房东!跟她们聊天很开心,她们也非常认真地跟我介绍厨房里的东西怎么用,还专门为我洗了个热水壶出来烧热水喝,哈哈｡Ana推荐的餐馆也很好,带我走捷径过去｡告诉我附近的便利店在哪里｡晚上我要出去跑步,还专门推荐我去附近的Williamsburg Bridge跑,说那里跑步的人多,灯光明亮,感觉真的很好｡
Ana家附近地铁步行大概6-7分钟可以到,去地铁的路上就会路过大小超市便利店,我总是顺便买个泡面回家,哈哈｡总之地理位置对我而言很棒,去South Ferry很近,去布鲁克林也方便｡
我很喜欢房间的布置,面积并不小哦,床也很舒服,卫生间超级干净｡啊｡｡｡｡总之,在曼哈顿选择住Ana家很棒,我还愿意去,一起喝咖啡,蹭煎饺子吃,跟她们再聊聊天｡[QWERTY123]I stayed here for 2 months and found it a fantastic place to base my stay in New York.  Great location near good restaurants, bars, stores and excellent transport connections.  The apartment is well fitted out and the room is spacious and has fantastic views (as does the living room and balcony).  Ana and Kathie are lovely (Hidden by Airbnb) , always friendly and on hand with tips for exploring the city, but as a longer term stay it also felt like you had your own space.  Superb place to stay![QWERTY123]Amazing hospitality!!! If all my other AirBNBs could model after this host, I wouldn’t even consider hotels anymore.[QWERTY123]Ana and Kathy are incredible hosts! Their apartment is a gem by the East River in a very hip part of town. My stay with them made for a wonderful ""New York experience""![QWERTY123]The stay with Ana and Kathie was very satisfying. First I got to say that the location of the apartment is absolutely outstanding. You have literally everything and anything around that I could imagine needing. Ana and Kathie both were very helpful when needed and could give some nice local insider hints to start out. 

The place is as described and exactly as seen in the pictures. People live there, but it is always clean, the room easy fits two if you don’t need a lot of space. I basically have nothing to complain about. 

Only thing is that their management seems to be a bit difficult at times - I would call it a guarded building basically. There is someone downstairs checking who comes and leaves, so be prepared there might be complications. Ana was always helpful getting everything to work, however this makes me give 4 stars. Nothing really personal, but it’s just a matter of fact. 

The Rooftop is, and I can’t emphasize this enough, amazing. Really not kidding, you won’t find better in Lower East if you are not willing to spend triple the buck. 

I enjoyed some quick conversations all the time. Apart from a dinner where Ana cooked for me (make her show you her Impanadad, they are awesome) we didn’t hang out too much. Not because it wouldn’t have worked out but simply because we both just had enough to do I guess. They both are very nice persons. 

Safe clean friendly environment, nothing you could want more ;) Thanks![QWERTY123]Ana and Kathie’s place is like ‘your home away from home’.  Info before and during my visit was very helpful and prompt replies. Both Ana and Kathie are wonderful hosts and I would strongly recommend their home. 

The apartment is in a great location for lower Manhattan and Brooklyn. Their outdoor balcony is a great luxury feature, I particularly enjoyed having breakfast and evening drinks overlooking the East River, Manhattan and Brooklyn bridges. Area is very safe to be around at night with bars and restaurants only 10 mins away in Chinatown."	40.71140158286072	-73.9879353634066	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/19319	1	92.0	0.783333
50	7801	"We stayed at Chaya's place for a week with our 2 kids. We had a wonderful time there, it was such a relief to have all that beautiful open space to come home to after an activity filled day in New York. The loft has a really peaceful feel to it, and it is surprisingly quiet during the night even though it is just around the corner from Bedford street. We loved the sauna, makes me wish we had one at home too... 
The apartment is well located, just a block or two from the L train, so getting to and from Manhattan is a breeze.[QWERTY123]This loft was incredible.  I last lived in NYC in a Soho sublet and Chaya's loft easily surpasses even that experience.  The kitchen had everything we needed.  The bed was wonderfully restful and the shag rug by the wall-sized projection system had memory foam underneath.  Not to mention the sauna.  And all this for less than what we were prepared to pay for the Hotel Chelsea.  My friends were blown away.  We hope our next vacation to NYC corresponds to one of Chaya's vacations.[QWERTY123]Simply AWESOME! We felt right at home at Chaya's loft.  It was clean and beautiful.  All the comforts of home. Maybe too comfortable.  We didn't want to leave! The location was perfect. WAY better than staying in a hotel room.  Worth every dime and then some.[QWERTY123]NA[QWERTY123]Beautiful loft. The best place I've stayed in NYC. Hands Down! So many cool touches to the place. The kitchen is great and we had several dinners here. The rug is super comfy! The place was super clean.
The loft is very close to the subway (1 stop from Manhattan). Bedford ave is full of interesting shops, bars and nightlife. nearby I recommend the following:

shopping- Williamsburg flea market on saturdays, Bird, Meg

eating out: Diner, Marlow and Sons, Bozu, Walter's, Five Leaf, Fette Sau, Saltie, Egg, Pies n Thighs

bars: Union Pool , Hotel Delmano, Brooklyn Bowl

I would definitely recommend this place to friends and stay here again.[QWERTY123]Nice place, and although I didn't meet Chaya, talked to her on the phone and we worked everything out great.[QWERTY123]Chaya's loft was in a perfect position for exploring both Brooklyn and Manhattan. We were slightly disappointed with the level of cleanliness when we arrived (we couldn't tell if the bed had fresh sheets or not, for instance), but that said, we had a comfortable and enjoyable stay over all.  

Chaya gave us some good tips for the area. We ended up trying Best Pizza (on a night we had to stay in and wait for a lost bag to be delivered by an airline) and it was great. I can also highly recommend Diner for brunch![QWERTY123]The photos don't do Chaya's place justice!  Without exaggerating, we couldn't believe our eyes when we first walked in.  It was huge, a very cool layout, and beautiful.  They have their own sauna!  Is this normal in Brooklyn?  We had 3 people in our party and visited at the end of august for 4 days/nights.  Hurricane Irene had caused nyc to shut down the mta and it looked likely we were going to spend 2 of the 4 days stuck inside.  Despite this, we were very thankful to have such a comfortable space that felt like home.  It was a very special trip and this space had a lot to do with that.  Thank you, Chaya!  Your place would be my number one choice to stay in NY![QWERTY123]Chaya's apartment  is amazing and even nicer than it looks in the photos.  The location was perfect for exploring Brooklyn and so close to the subway that you can be in Manhattan in no time at all. We also stayed in a nice hotel in SoHo on our trip but it didn't even compare to how good Chaya's place is, we would recommend it to everyone. Thank you.[QWERTY123]We loved Chaya's apartment.  It is very well appointed including the kitchen which had everything I needed to cook up a storm.  The bed is so comfortable that it rivals my own at home.  We really loved the projector and watching football and movies on the huge wall.  The neighbors are very quiet, and the neighborhood is great and so quiet despite being just feet off of a main street. It is a perfect place to hang out even though getting away is easy with  the subway only two blocks away We are definitely planning on staying here again"	40.71841760224949	-73.95718343259446	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/7801	4	299.0	0.533333
51	7970	"This place is very very old but is kept very clean by the building manager. The air-con works intermittently, so the upper loft section gets very hot and unbearable to sleep in. If you don't mind old, then this place provides all the basics: a comfy bed, a shower, a fridge and a stove.[QWERTY123]My parents actually stayed in this place and absolutly loved it, the location was perfect for them and the apartment was really clean and comfy. 
I'm sure they would recommend this place to anyone, especially an older couple like themselves who want to be in the thick of all the action for an action packed stay in the big apple. I would also like to thank Cee for letting me book the place for my parents. Cheers![QWERTY123]This place is old but comfortable, I believe it would need a deep cleaning.  The only problem we had was the noise from the people above, seems like they never sleep.
Having an elevator for 4th floor is a perk.[QWERTY123]I never saw cee but the super was really friendly. The room was old but very clean. Good neighborhood and close to many things and a short subway ride to others. We had four people with us so the price was good.[QWERTY123]I stayed there for a 2 night stay with 4 other friends (we were 5 adults total) and it was big enough. It is an old appartement that's for sure but it is very well located!!!! You can walk to Union square, Macy's, times square etc... The 2 double beds were comfy but the sofa was terrible as per my friend...I also believe that it would need a deep cleaning. I would suggest that people brings their own towels and sheets in order to avoid (Website hidden by Airbnb) conclude I would say that for the price we paid, it is worth it![QWERTY123]Good price for a cute rental. I stayed for 4 nights. 
It is an older rental, however most of the apartments in New York are. I was happy with it. 
I was easily able to reach Cee when I needed her, which was nice. 
I was happy to have a small kitchen with a fridge and microwave for leftovers.
Very nice neighborhood. Easy walk to attractions.
Overall, I was very happy with everything.[QWERTY123]Cee was very helpful and responsive leading up to and during the trip.  The location is ideal for walking around the city and seeing all the sites and destination locations.  The place is pretty much exactly as pictured--its not a brand new place--but it has city charm and we had everything we could need right there in the apartment for a visit to NYC.  Excellent visit and a great place to stay for several people!  We had 3, but easily sleeps 4, and upwards of 6 if pressed.  Would gladly stay here again![QWERTY123]The apartment was great. Good location and easy to find. The super was a bit clueless and slow, but it didn't bother me. The cleaning guy was real nice. The place was supposed to be ready at 3pm and we had to wait until 4pm. That's the only complaint. It appeared as if noone actually lives there.[QWERTY123]This is a well-located apartment in Chelsea with plenty of space for my adult daughter and (Website hidden by Airbnb) was clean and comfortable - kind of basic but fine.[QWERTY123]It was a great experience of N.Y.C staying in this apartment. It is well located. You can go to most of the places to be seen by foot in N.Y.C. The team who manages the building is really fun with a real N.Y.C accent. We were proposed to let our luggages in their office in the basement for the last day so that we could enjoy few more hours the city. Size of the appartment is Ok for three people, you do not feel like a rabbit in his cage ;). Conclusion : good place even if building a bit old.[QWERTY123]Perfect solution to live and visit New York, very near to everything (the Flatiron building really behind the corner, and the delicious hamburgers of Shake Shak too!), metro and bus just a few minutes. The house was very clean, confortable, nice, spacious. We were 3 and we staied very very well! Out of the window you can see the Empire State Building! :) I really reccomend this solution![QWERTY123]Cee apartment is great! Really comfortable and great location!

[QWERTY123]Cee's place was as advertised - well-located, basic -- and fit our needs. The bed was uncomfortable, the lighting was dim, and the apartment could use a deep clean. If you have back problems or are looking for a nice spot to hang out, look elsewhere. But if you want a reasonable, convenient crash pad for up to 5 people, this is your place. Cee was responsive to questions via email, and though she was not around, the super let us in with no problems. Bring earplugs for street noise.[QWERTY123]Perfect location. Right in the centre of everything. You really can see the Empire State Building from the window & at he weekend there is a great flea market across the street.

We really enjoyed our stay and would definately return.[QWERTY123]We stayed in two places during our long weekend in NY. This place was the better of the two - even if the other one was technically ""nicer."" This place is bigger than the pictures imply, and the big bed, which isn't shown in these pics, was very comfy. Cee was very nice and responded quickly when there was a little snafu with the keys. The price is great. I'd definitely stay here again before I'd ever stay in a hotel or another apartment on this site.[QWERTY123]This is an amazing, central location to all you would want to see in Manhattan!  One block from beautiful Madison Square Park, lots of activity, a 2-minute walk to the N,Q,R subway, 15-minute walk to Times Square, and Eataly is right nearby (get your morning latte there every day!).  The building management is really nice and helpful and when the sink in the bathroom had a leak, they were right on top of getting it fixed.  Cee was quick to respond to everything and answered whatever questions we had before we arrived.  It's an old building so some water temp changes and squeaky floors are to be expected.  The apartment could use a bit of an update (some of the furniture feels well-worn, the ""loft"" is more of a crawl space, and the kitchen doesn't really inspire use) but you should be out exploring anyway so for the price it's totally worth it.  By no means is this to say it's a dump...just don't expect the Ritz.  This place is more ideal for explorers rather than those looking for a romantic getaway.  It's a great spot, comfortable enough, and in a very safe area...with very nice people attached (Cee and the management).[QWERTY123]Location was just perfect! Very close to Broadway and 5th Avenue. Flat is a bit old and could be cleaner. It was big enough for all 3 of us. Very quiet at night which was a good surprise![QWERTY123]Great location for business or vacations to NYC. The apartment is close to food, a 24hr convenience store, subway stops, etc. Have stayed in this building before and would stay here again.[QWERTY123]Aunque no conocimos a Cee, los encargados del edificio nos atendieron perfectamente. La localización del apartamento es magnífica, a un paseo de Times Square, en un barrio espléndido, donde hay un montón de lugares con música en vivo (en la 26), supermercados, etc. La única pega seria es la conexión a internet, que es sólo por cable y no pudimos conectar los móviles por wifi, pero es tal y como aparece en las fotos, con vistas al Empire State desde la cama. De todas formas, es un apartamento muy recomendable.[QWERTY123]Great Location to everything.  Keys were there and delivered by the super.  My only thing was that it did need a little updating.  Coffee maker was probably from the 1970 and still had used coffee grind from, i guess, the previous renter. :( if we are paying for cleaning fees, than i would expect everything cleaned.. sorry..
But the location was great.[QWERTY123]Thanks Cee for letting us stay in your apartment last week We stayed for five nights and the location was great. The apartment was clean, supplied well with plenty of towels for the four of us and the Super was easy to work with. 
[QWERTY123]Super séjour dans cet appartement bien situé à deux pas du Madison Square Park. La rue est calme et la vue donne sur l'Empire. Bien équipé.[QWERTY123]The location of the apartment is perfect ! There are more than enough subway stations in the area. The apartment itself is cozy and nice. Although it could use some renovation here and there,  it was clean  and we felt at home. You can hear the elevator but that's only the first night, then you get used to the sound. Clean Towels and linen were  provided. The super is very nice and helps right away if he's needed! We left our bags in the basement and could fully enjoy the last day in Manhattan. (The view of the Empire State Building right outside the window every morning and every night wasn't bad either )  We'd like to come back and we recommend Cee's place to friends and family![QWERTY123]The reservation was canceled 121 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.[QWERTY123]Great location indeed! This apartment is just as it says in the write-up and comments made.  It is a great experience of true NYC.  I would just advise if you are sensitive to mattresses (a.k.a. back/neck issues), the mattress is old and lumpy and not supportive and the pillows are awful.  If you were to bring your own pillow, you may be better off.  I agree with the other reviews that an uplift may be in order....but if you just want an easy place to stay that is super convenient, this is the place for you![QWERTY123]Very good location! Nice place in the heart of the city. We had a good time at this comfortable flat.[QWERTY123]After spending ten nights in this apartment I guess it grew on us ..we did have a few problems which included .The wifi dropping out constantly ..which was our main source of communication with family and friends ...the appliances where very old or non existence (hope the new toaster we brought stays for other guests) ..the toilet was a big problem overflowing and running constantly after talking with Winston who was always on hand to fix it for us ..it was a issue in the rest of the building 
I tried to contact Cee and got her sister instead who was happy to send her father around to fix things if Winston couldn't ... The bedding could be upgraded putting two flat pillows inside one case not my idea of comfort. However you can't beat the location and if you want to experience a real old New York appartment then give it a go ..after all it's the experience that makes a holiday for me ...
Cee take note of all the other reviews about the cleanliness and comfort of your guests and this would be a great place to stay...probably only cost you one nights rent .. I would just like to thank Winston for all his help we found him very friendly and helpful 
Cheers the girls from OZ[QWERTY123]We had a pleasent stay at the Appartment. It was spacious, clean and perfectly located.[QWERTY123]Great location! People were always there to help![QWERTY123]El departamento esta muy bien , bien ubicado , cómodo, silencioso.Por la ventana se puede ver el Empire State.  Es muy  recomendable y si tendría que volver a NY no tendría dudas en volver a este departamento. El portero Winston muy atento. 
[QWERTY123]Starting off with the positives. The location is perfect, the house is big enough for three people and clean, and the host and live-in super were friendly and helpful. The house is however kind of old. 

On our last night we had accidentally left a bag with some unfinished food next to the trashcan and unfortunately we found 2 mice in the kitchen area that night. That was partly our fault but we think it is something we should mention.[QWERTY123]The appartment has an ideal location in NY, very central if you want to visit most of the neighbourhoods of the city.
But i must say we were expecting a much cleaner appartment especially because of the important cleaning fees we had to pay. The floor needed vacuming, the dishes were a bit sticky and the overall atmosphere did not appear very clean. 
Some people might also be disturbed by the noise. (Upstairs neighbor and lift) 
We did not get the opportunity to meet the host but the super was welcoming and let us in when we arrived and also offered to keep our bags on our last day so that we could enjoy the city.[QWERTY123]Everything was great. Really enjoyed the location. The apartment was clean and comfortable.[QWERTY123]Chic Chelsea was an amazing spot. I absolutely loved the central location of the building - only being a block or two away from Q, 6, D, F and more! I also loved the burnt down chruch across the street. The Antique fairs during the weekend were a great morning activity. Cee was really helpful with the stay. Her and Winston made sure we had everything we needed![QWERTY123]Great Apartment. And great hospitality[QWERTY123]Cee's place is extremely conveniently located within midtown, just next to Madison Sq Park and the Flatiron Building.
The apartment is cosy - if not a little Spartan - and was very clean throughout, with windows looking onto the street, and out over the Serbian Orthodox Cathedral of St. Sava.
The road can be a little noisy at night, so it's worth keeping the windows and curtains well shut.
Overall, Cee's place offers exceptional value.[QWERTY123]Great location! Cee was very helpful and responsive to any questions we had.[QWERTY123]Staying here was a terrific stay! I felt so safe, and comfortable. The management in the building was always kind and thoughtful. Everything was incredibly convenient. Perfect location."	40.74300311033664	-73.99065196334173	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/7970	2	120.0	0.755556
52	19601	"Maggie's apartment has a beautiful kitchen and living room, and was perfect for our holiday get together.  The location is ideal, it is on quiet street but close to all the subway lines and to downtown Brooklyn.  I highly recommended this apartment![QWERTY123]Beautiful, extremely spacious apartment in fabulous Bklyn Heights location.  Maggie was very easy to work with, everything was exactly as described.  A great wknd get-away![QWERTY123]If you are a family with kids this is the prefect place to stay.  The master suite feels like you are in a stylish hotel.  Elegant and beautifully designed.  As if you left the kids at home and are taking a romantic getaway.  But downstairs there are two bedrooms surrounding a large playroom filled with every toy and instrument you could imagine.  Maggie even brought out age appropriate toys in anticipation of our arrival with a three year old.  So that saves you a whole suitcase from home.  Large, luxurious, great design and Maggie was a phone call away to handle any of the houses quirks.  Like a door that wouldn't open (there are two separate entrances - so not a big deal).  Or an alarm that wasn't connected to anything.  Maggie took care of everything. I highly recommend staying here.  You'll be glad you did.[QWERTY123]Our stay could not have been nicer! The house is welcoming and comfortable. We felt right at home. The host was very helpful and easy to communicate with. The location is ideal for Brooklyn: A step in either direction to get to Dumbo or Carroll Gardens, and so easy to get to lower Manhattan. Highly recommended.[QWERTY123]Maggie's place was by far the most spacious, homey and yet somehow also the most elegant and distinctive place our family has stayed in in NYC. We take our NYC family trips seriously and do them often, almost always staying in Maggie's Brooklyn Heights neighborhood. Maggie's house was super convenient and she was incredibly generous and communicative as a host.[QWERTY123]Maggie's appartment is extremely spacious and conveniently located. As listed it is ideal for a family. The subway is just round the corner and it's one stop to Wall Street. Everyday we had a great breakfast in the diner opposite the subway which set us up for the whole day. The Japanese Restaurant Iron Chef House , a real gem was also just round the corner. 
we did not meet Maggie but she left full instructions and e-mailed us while we were there. 
Upstairs was a little cold (we stayed at Christmas) but we had been told in advance and came prepared.[QWERTY123]Maggie has a beautiful, spacious apartment filled with great art and furniture.  Really beautiful decor!  And, the apartment couldn't be in a better location- I am certain anyone visiting New York will enjoy all the great neighborhood amenities (restaurants, bars, beautiful parks)  and close proximity to Manhattan.  Maggie knows the area intimately and can give great travel tips to get the most out of your stay.  This would be a perfect holiday location to really soak in all that Brooklyn and all of New York has to offer![QWERTY123]Our stay in Maggie's apartment was great.  The apartment is in a great neighborhood in Brooklyn and is very close to Manhattan with all major subway stops around.  You do feel like you are in a house and there is plenty of room for a family.   There are loads of games for kids so our two were well entertained while staying there.  The apartment is very nice and super quiet, I would recommend it to others looking for a lot of space which is hard to find.   Great master bathroom with a rain shower and huge washer and dryer.  Maggie was really easy and nice to deal with, and made herself available despite being on holiday herself.[QWERTY123]Première expérience en ce qui nous concerne avec Airb&b ....
et très positive ;)  
Nous avons passé deux nuits dans l'appartement de Maggie & C° avec nos 4 ados.  On s'est tout de suite senti à l'aise, cool ""comme à la maison"".  Belle situation qui nous a fait découvrir Brooklyn: une autre facette de NY ... pleine de charme .  
Merci Maggie pour toutes les infos reçues >>> Nous nous sommes régalés d' un petit déjeuner génial chez Iris café.  


[QWERTY123]Worked out great for what we were looking for and good communication before check in.[QWERTY123]Maggie was easy to deal with and left straight-forward directions for us in her home.  It's a great place in the beautiful Brooklyn Heights neighborhood.  Our group of 7 had plenty of room to sleep and gather, and the locale cannot be beat.  Good small outdoor space, and easy walking to almost any subway line you'd want.[QWERTY123]The reservation was canceled 58 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.[QWERTY123]As firt time users of Airbnb, Maggie was very patient with us, she gave us accurate & clear instructions.  

The duplex is very well located in Brooklyn Heights, close to several subway stations.  Also nearby, you can walk to grocery stores, pharmacy, wine store, very convenient...we also walked down the Brooklyn Bridge, this is a must if you stay at Maggie's...

The duplex was very spacious for our party of 5, it has a very nice master bedroom with in-suite bathroom on the upper level.  Nice living room with a large dining area, we used only the kitchen area for breakfast, another good asset for this apartment!  The two other rooms located on the lower level were kind a small but ok for the kids.

I was concerned with parking in this area but I easily found a 25$ per day parking for the minivan on Livingston St., less than 15 minutes walk from the duplex...

We wanted to live like locals in the NYC area, we got what we wanted...thanks Maggie ![QWERTY123]Maggie was a perfect host, very responsive and accommodating. Her apartment was perfect for our family of 5 visiting NYC for the holidays. Highly recommended.[QWERTY123]Great neighborhood, beautiful family home.  Maggie provided our out of town guests with a perfect spot to stay while they visited us in Dumbo.  Close to everything.[QWERTY123]The host canceled this reservation 14 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.[QWERTY123]We needed a place for green rooms for actors and Maggie happily obliged.  Very responsive, clean and accommodating and a beautiful space for a stay.[QWERTY123]This is a lovely apartment in a fantastic neighborhood that is perfectly situated for exploring Brooklyn without being too far from your favorite activities in Manhattan. Maggie is a wonderful hostess--responsive and flexible--and we really enjoyed the apartment's cosy, artsy, family-friendly vibe. We also had great fun studying the photo collages in the kitchen and office--full of surprises! Highly recommended.[QWERTY123]This place was amazing. My friends and I did not expect the apartment to be so spacious and well furnished. We had a great time and would definitely recommend this location![QWERTY123]What a beautiful home in a great location of Brooklyn Heights! The pictures really don't do the place justice — incredible art and furnishing, tons of space, and one of the most beautiful blocks in the neighborhood. Great communication with Maggie in the days leading up to our stay. My bridesmaids and I got ready for my wedding here, and it couldn't have been better. Highly recommended![QWERTY123]Maggie was very thoughtful host.  She made sure everything was prepared to our needs before our arrival.  The apartment and neighborhood are so comfortable, cozy, and so large and spacious for NYC standards.  The neighborhood is everything you would want from your NYC experience, close to transport, shops, restaurants, amazing walks, museums, etc.  Maggie's place will be the place we turn to whenever we come to NYC again.[QWERTY123]Great stay; we felt like prosperous Brooklyn Heights denizens for two days. Wonderful location. We walked and biked to explore Brooklyn Heights, Dumbo, and Vinegar Hill with a bike ride for a touch of Gowanus and its uber Whole Foods. Apartment is big, tall ceilinged, and comfortable. We cooked one night; great Viking range. With all its personal effects around, it definitely felt like parchuting into another family's life. Be vigilant when unloading; we managed to get a $60 ticket.[QWERTY123]Maggie made us feel very welcome. She sent informative emails before our visit and checked up on us while we were there. The apartment was clean and equipped with everything we needed.[QWERTY123]Maggie's place is really beautiful and the neighborhood was very conveniently located since we were attending a conference in Dumbo. One thing to keep in mind is that the check-in and check-out times are strict so plan ahead, we had a long over night flight so Maggie was kind enough to let us drop off our luggage and we tried to do the best of our time while we could finally check in and feel like humans again. For the rest, the place was clean, a little bit chilly for the time of the year but overall it was a good experience.[QWERTY123]We were so fortunate to get to stay in this Airbnb rental. Maggie's apartment was perfect for our family of 6, 2 adults and 4 kids. It is comfortable and beautifully decorated. A real pleasure to stay in. It is also extremely well situated with multiple train lines, supermarkets and playgrounds within easy walking distance. Maggie was so helpful and reassuring while we were planning our trip. Everything was exactly as she had described it. Once we arrived she checked in with us many times. Thank you to Maggie for giving us a super time in NY."	40.69723042504888	-73.99268489258382	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/19601	8	800.0	0.8

It's uberclose to all that is cute &all that is yummy.
Starlee herself has to be an amazing chica,she emailed us
Some fab places to eat,shop,see&be seen....I can't wait to
Return...GRACIAS Starlee!!!!xo=^..^=[QWERTY123]Responsible, responsive and altogether great person to deal with. Spacious homey place in the heart of Williamsburg, quiet yet full of local flavor and close to anything you'd ever need in the vicinity. Highly recommended.[QWERTY123]Cute small apartment in top location! The area is amazing - lots of cafés and nice little shops. We also felt very safe. The apartment is individually furnished and we enjoyed all the little arty details! Our bed was comfortable and we had everything we needed although it could have been a little bit cleaner. We would definitely stay there again and recommend it to our friends.[QWERTY123]amazing apt in the best location.
we stayed there for a week and it felt so homey and comfterble.
had the best time 
tnx alot
d&d[QWERTY123]Starlee's darling apartment is exactly as described, only just a little bit more so.  It is even more sunny; the kitchen and living room are just a little more roomier; and the neighborhood is even more fantastic.  As the reviews of Starlee share, she is responsive and helpful.  Would def stay here again![QWERTY123]We had a lovely time staying at Starlee's apartment. We felt very safe and the apartment is light and the living areas spacious. 

Williamsburg is very cool and we had no shortage of great places to eat and 24/7 supermarkets etc. The subway is very close and is it probably quicker to get into the centre of Manhattan from Bedford Av than places way up town. 

Starless was a pleasure to deal with and always quick to respond. We would recommend her apartment to friends and would love to come back![QWERTY123]Starlee's place is HUGE. Way too much space for me and my husband. We didn't know what to do with it all. The bed was extremely comfy. The location was prime and allowed us to do all the things we wanted to do in NY, without any problems. The area has many great boutiques to enjoy from vintage clothing spots to a cheese monger! I was very pleased to find that gem with delicious bries, just baked breads, pickled veggies, and tasty home-made local jams and jellies. Starlee made it easy for us too. If there was anything that needed a fixin', it was the sloped floors, they made me a little dizzy. But other than that, it felt like home. Thanks Starlee.[QWERTY123]We had a great time staying at Starlee's place! We found the apartment spacious, sunny and really quiet - simply a lovely place to be! The bed was really comfortable and we felt really at home! The only thing was it could have done with a bit of a clean - especially the bath tub, but other than that it was fine! We though that the area was fabulous - loads of great shops, cafes and bars nearby and it is really close to the subway so quick to get into the city! Thanks Starlee! We would certainly think about staying the next time we come to NYC![QWERTY123]We couldn't have asked for a better location... 5 - 10 min walk to the L Train, Bedford Ave and only a 45 min walk over the Williamsburg bridge to Manhattan. The neighbourhood is very safe, buzzing with activity, yet quiet enough to sleep undisturbed. Natural light illuminates the apartment and it's much bigger than the photos illustrate. Thanks again.[QWERTY123]Starlee's place was amazing! Great location, clean, cute and comfortable. Highly recommend u stay here. Starlee was really helpful in giving advice on the local area and Manhattan. Great intro to NYC![QWERTY123]Starlee's place was lovely with character and personality. Though a bit dusty, it was comfortable, with a kitchen that was well-equipped and airy, a living room that was big and cosy, and a bedroom, though small, had the most comfortable double bed I had ever slept in. 

Starlee was most accommodating as well as I was having trouble finding a place to stay for some of the days I was in NYC. The location of the flat couldn't be more perfect, just a few minutes away from happening Bedford ave in Williamsburg and a short walk to the subway, which gets you into Manhattan in less than 10 mins. It was a lovely place.
[QWERTY123]Great location and cozy appartment - would really recommend other people staying there. Allthoug the appartment could have needed some cleaning.[QWERTY123]Very comfortable appartment, well located. Thank you Starlee ![QWERTY123]Great location, very spacious and cozy apartment. The internet was unfortunately not working but Starlee's bike made the stay worth it.[QWERTY123]Starlee's apartment was very comfortable, we felt right at home. The location is amazing, the neighborhood has lots of great restaurants and bars. It was very quiet at night and lots of sunshine in the morning. I would most definitely consider staying again. The only drawback was that I was unable to contact starlee about picking up keys until the day before, however it was all sorted out quickly, and there were no other issues. It is a very pleasant place to stay and I would recommend this to all my friends. Thank you starlee![QWERTY123]Starlee's apartment is great and in a really good location in heart of the action in Williamsburg. It has its own individuality and is a really good place to hang out, before exploring the neat shops, cafes and bars which are all on the doorstep.  only met Starlee briefly but she was really helpful, as was an email that she sent before my stay telling me where everything was. All in all I would say that there isn't a better place that you could stay in New York, this place is definitely recommended![QWERTY123]We had a great time staying at Starlees' place. The apartment is located super great. But there were, a few downsides, the place was so dirty. There weren’t any clean bed sheets, only the ones the people who stayed before us had used. That is a bit disgusting when we where told there would be clean ones ready.  We also had a mouse visiting.  The internet bill was not paid, so it did not work, which was really annoying. It was a bit difficult getting Starlee to answer the emails we send her. All in all, the location is great and the apartment is nice, but it really needed a clean up, and when you are on vacation and pay 100 dollars per night you don’t really feel like cleaning up for other people.[QWERTY123]Starlee's place is authentic NY living, amazing location at the intersection of three awesome Brooklyn ""vibes"" and a turn of the century floor-through at that. When a small complication came up during my stay, Starlee was right on top of things. This is NOT a hotel, but if you're into that and a fan of a certain kind NY living, this place is spot-on.[QWERTY123]Great apartment in an a perfect location. Quiet and close to great bars and restaurants in Williamsburg, and if you need to get to Manhattan, the L train is a very short walk. Overall the apartment is pretty big and is definitely cozy and comfortable. Really great place to stay![QWERTY123]Location Location Location!  The apartment is charming, the library is fantastic, and the host is lovely.[QWERTY123]Wonderfully central location in Williamsburg.  Near everything, subway is 5 minutes away with Mahattan just another 5 after that. I actually spent more nights in Williamsburg then I did in Manhattan because I loved the spirit of the location so much. This is an old apartment and so it was a little dusty, but still I felt very much at home quite quickly. Also, bed is comfy!

Starlee was very accommodating when I locked myself out and was so friendly about the whole thing, it really made my day.

My sole complaint would be that communication with Starlee was a little bit slow. But in the end everything was taken care of and I really enjoyed my week in NYC![QWERTY123]Nice and cozy apartment in a good position in Williamsburg. Quiet at night and very close to all the main attractions of the area. 5/10 mins by walk from metro stations.[QWERTY123]Starlee was was adorable and her appartment is great. Perfectly situated in the heart of Williamsburg, good light, cosy and nicely decorated.

She was easy to contact and very kind with us, relaxed and friendly.
I would definitely recommend her and her appartment!

Martin and Silje



[QWERTY123]Great location! really bright and cheerful place especially with the cold winter outside. Starlee was there to welcome us after a long journey. I would stay there again in a heart beat.[QWERTY123]The location is great! Williamsburg is a best place to stay. A lot of interesting people around! Also very close to Manhattan. Starlee is kind and lovely person! She made for me a list of good cafes, restaurants, shops in the neighborhood. 
The bed is very comfy!!!  So is the couch in the living room. A lot of space. By the way there is a lot of great books in the apartment. So if you like to read before going to sleep you will have amazing choice:) If I'm in NYC I will definitely try to book this apt again!
[QWERTY123]Starlee's place is the best. Great apartment and amazing location. Right in the heart of Williamsburg which is full of great cafes, restaurants and live venues - we saw a bunch of great bands just streets away. It is also just a few blocks from the L train which takes you right into Manhattan. Would definitely stay here again.[QWERTY123]Starlee's place is great. Perfect location, close to the M and the L. Great bars and restaurants around. Couldn't ask for me.

Thanks, and look forward to staying again![QWERTY123]Starlee's apartment is great. Cozy, quiet and perfectly located in the heart of Williamsburg. Starlee is a great host too. She is very quick to answer to all my e.mails. 
Gabriele e Azzurra[QWERTY123]The flat was really nice and the neighborhood is really cool but a few things bowerred us during or before our stay and as we paid 39€ for cleaning we thought it was important to say these things :

- Before coming Starlee was difficult to reach and took 2 weeks to respond to our emails.
- the floor was really unclean with dog hair, we hoovered the place ourself, the towels she gave us were completely wet, the bathroom carpet was really dirty. There was no room for our clothes or stuff so we had to put them on the dirty floor.
- as told, we went to a bar down the street to get the keys when we arrived. Back at the apartment the keys would'nt open the door so we went back to the bar again (still with our luggages) and we had to call her to discover that she was in the apartment and there was no interphone for us to find out.[QWERTY123]From the very beginning it was easy to reach Starlee and she made it very easy for me to get the keys. I was so happy for the strong wi-fi and Starlee left me some room to hang things in the closet. She checked on me upon my arrival and wanted me to have a great stay. I knew by reading the reviews to expect dirty floors and yes, they were really dusty but since I was there for a month I swept them. She washes some things at home so since the towels are air-dried they come out stiff. I used them, knowing they are clean but then eventually just visited the Laundromat. The building is really old, and the bedroom at this time of year (Feb) was really drafty, but Starlee provides a nice, safe Vornado space heater to use and it keeps the room warm. The rest of the apt is very comfortable, only the bedroom was cold on the nights it was below freezing. I would definitely stay at Starlee’s again because it is just so convenient to get to Manhattan, I really found some great restaurants in Williamsburg, and I got so addicted to all the great coffee within walking distance.[QWERTY123]Great spot, amazing food and shopping within 5 minute walk. Easy pick up of keys. Had a couple of issues with the WiFi but nothing major, if all else fails you can use the coffee shop wifi which which reaches the apartment. Fairly easy to get to Manhattan! All in all my girlfriend and I enjoyed our stay.[QWERTY123]Great place and great host - very comfortable and clean without being sterile. Some towels were damp when we got there, but clean - not a big deal. Good light, amazing location, and still not noisy in the bedroom. What more could you want?[QWERTY123]Starlee's apartment is the perfect place to stay for anyone     going to Williamsburg.  She has a great book collection and a comfy bed.  This apartment is charming and perfectly situated.[QWERTY123]Great apartment in a great location. So close to the L train and a bunch of cool stuff around. The place was clean and was the perfect spot to arrive at. I greatly appreciated the cleaning that Starlee did due to my girlfriend and mines allergies. The place was spotless. 
Thanks![QWERTY123]Starlee a un bel appartement, très mignon et très bien situé, dans le quartier de Williamsburg, au métro Bedford avenue. (situé à 10min de Manhattan).[QWERTY123]A really great and big apartment in a really nice neighborhood. Starlee was a great host and we had a great first experience with airbnb. 
We can recommend this place to those who wants to live in the center of Williamsburg.[QWERTY123]Very convenient location to explore NYC from. Close to the subway taking you right into Manhattan, local conveniences moments away. And all the bars and restaurants of Williamsburg just a few minutes away. Starlee was away so we never met her, but she made sure that all the arrangements for our arrival was in place. We had the whole apartment to ourselves, and had a great stay.[QWERTY123]Stayed a week at Starlee's. Great apartment, very convenient, close to the L train and the shops you'd need in this situation.
Very bright, colorful, really makes you feel welcome. We had largely enough space for two people.

We didn't meet Starlee in person, but the check-in and check-out were nevertheless quite easy, and she still was very helpful about the place.

Highly recommended.[QWERTY123]Starlee was an awesome host and her place was really awesome. It's an amazing location, and it's decorated really well.

It was super easy getting keys and organizing when to check in and heck out. She's super responsive.[QWERTY123]We stayed at Starlee's for a week-long getaway, and it was the perfect retreat when we wanted a little quiet from the high energy of the city.

Starlee was very responsive to any question I had and gave good recommendations for things to do.

The internet went out when we first arrived, but Starlee was quick to get the issue resolved and there were no more issues with the internet the rest of the week.[QWERTY123]Starlee went above and beyond to work with my short notice.  She really made me feel welcome in her place which made the stay excellent.  I would highly recommend this apartment if you are looking for a laid back experience in Williamsburg.[QWERTY123]Starlee's place was in a perfect location in Williamsburg and even more spacious than the photos lead you to believe. I would recommend a stay here and I hope to return.[QWERTY123]We had a great time staying at Starlee. Her place is very cute, very well located. The communication was very easy. And the price was very attractive as well.[QWERTY123]Starlee was the perfect host in this cosy yet spacious apartment! She was always available and willing to answer any questions I may have had concerning the property or nearby locations!
Set in the heart of Williamsburg I thoroughly enjoyed staying at Starlee's and couldn't have wished for a better and more convenient location! 
I will surely be returning to this adorable property when I next visit New York and thoroughly recommend to anyone else![QWERTY123]Starlee's appartment is in an excellent location in Williamsburg, a neighbourhood which is on the Top 15 sightseeing list in the Lonely Planet. The appartment is cute and very comfortable. Starlee cares a lot about her guests and patiently answers all the questions ;-) I would definitely recommend to stay at that place![QWERTY123]Starlee had a lovely space which was well prepared, it was a pleasure staying there![QWERTY123]The host was friendly and efficient.  The location was perfect. The apartment was spacious, but the bedroom snug.  The photos are pretty much accurate.  The place is quirky and old, kinda like Brooklyn.  If you're staying on a budget and doing a quick visit, this place will do the job.[QWERTY123]The most ideal location! Starlee's space was cozy and had everything we needed. Close to several subway stations. Starlee was flexible and a very accommodating host![QWERTY123]Great location close to everything I was interested in during my stay. Starlee was there to greet us, give us the keys, and show us around. All-around hassle-free.[QWERTY123]The host canceled this reservation 34 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.[QWERTY123]My girlfriend and I stayed at Starlee's for one week and we loved the place, especially the area. Williamsburg is such an amazing neighbourhood! The apartment has a really cool interior and had all we needed (we only had a few problems with the sockets and our adapters!); it is also very close to Bedford Ave metro stop (L line). Following Starlee's suggestion, we tried the japanese restaurant in Grand Street, Samurai Mama. The food was amazing, especially the pork gyoza! There are two markets nearby, a Foodtown and a Whole Foods Market. And everything else you may need really...
Long story short, we look forward to going back!
[QWERTY123]Pros: convenient location, excellent host, spacious apartment, comfortable bed

Cons: Starlee has a dog, so if you're allergic, maybe don't book this place!

Starlee was super flexible! My other Airbnb host cancelled my reservation 1 day before my reservation and Starlee was able to provide a welcoming and clean environment for me and my sister. Williamsburg is a great spot and we were able to get to Manhattan easily. I'd recommend this apartment to NY visitors![QWERTY123]excellent séjour chez starlee. elle nous a très bien donner les instructions pour accéder a l'appartement même si on ne l'a pas vu.Le quartier est très vivant, vraiment bien situé. a 10min de Manhattan en métro. N’hésitez pas si vous voulez découvrir New York[QWERTY123]Great location in Williamsburg and the coffee and tea left for us were a lovely touch by Starlee. We definitely hope to stay here again when we visit Williamsburg.[QWERTY123]Ok[QWERTY123]Starlee´s place is really nice and perfectly located in Brooklyn. She was easy to reach and communicate. I totally recommend her place![QWERTY123]The perfect location in the middle of all the neighbourhood action. So close to everything you need in Williamsburg. There was so much room in this apartment, I truly felt like I was home.
Starlee was quick to reply to every question.[QWERTY123]We were expecting something different. The first impression when we arrived was the street door full of garbage, boots on the corridor outside the apartment door, the whole place full of things (food in the fridge, shoes and clothes everywhere...), some of the bulb lights were burned (no light at all in the bedroom). The only day that we eat there we had to wash the cutlery because of the dirt so finally we only use the apartment to sleep. 
Pros: location and price.[QWERTY123]Starlee est une personne très réactive, nous avons notamment eu un problème de wifi qu’elle a résolu immédiatement. 
Cependant concernant l’appartement en lui même, nous avons trouvé qu’il n’était pas propre (poussière, cheveux, un cafard vivant ! ), pas de climatisation...bien dommage au vu de la réactivité de Starlee.[QWERTY123]Starlee's place is typical of a slightly-run-down-but-charming-as-fuck NYC artists' apartment, filled with books and quirky decorative touches which I loved (especially all the text-based art, indicative of the fact that the host is a writer.) Starlee was super-quick to respond with answers to my questions, and everything was clean and lovely and set-up for a nice stay in Brooklyn. If you want a slice of arty Williamsburg living, this place is great![QWERTY123]The host canceled this reservation 3 days before arrival.

54	8025	"The Cbg Guest House is a treat. Hosted by the remarkable and welcoming Lisel, it's located in Park Slope close to Gorilla Coffee, plenty of good restaurants and easy subway access. This friendly rambling place is a gem.  

Peter H.[QWERTY123]I was made very welcome. The room was comfortable and the house clean. A great stay. Thank you.[QWERTY123]Staying at CbG has been a wonderful experience for me! Lisel Burns is an excellent host, the place is convenient and comfortable, the other guests are friendly and interesting. I feel lucky to have made such a great choice! Thanks! Estelle[QWERTY123]Lisel organised for us to stay with Fiona and Daniel in Marlborough Road. While this was a little further away (20-30min subway to Manhattan) we could not have been happier with our stay. They have a lovely old house an easy (5min) walk to the subway (Q and B lines). The family were welcoming and wonderful hosts, often offering us advise on sights to see, local places to eat and how to travel about town. The bedroom we stayed in was large and clean with a comfortable double bed and an ensuite with a shower over a large tub.  We could not recommend this lovely family more highly.[QWERTY123]I found the overall vibe of the guesthouse to be warm, welcoming and worldly - an ideal combination for a visit to the Big Apple. Park Slope is one of my favorite neighborhoods in Brooklyn and the Cbg guesthouse is in a great spot with so many great restaurants close by. The 2, 3, B and Q are all within a 6 or 7 min walk, so Manhattan is just a few stops away.

Lisel provides a great guesthouse with a great cause; I wholeheartedly recommend staying here. Bathrooms are shared, but kept so clean you feel like it's your own, and the kitchen is great for cooking or storing leftovers. 

Needless to say, I'm a fan and would stay here again in a new York minute.[QWERTY123]Great location! Accommodations are casual.[QWERTY123]I was in town to complete an orientation with Doctors Without Borders, so what better a place to stay than with Lisel, community organizer and friend of Haiti?
She has made her home into a welcoming place for true travelers and humanitarians. The bed was clean and comfy, the kitchen warm and welcoming and the garden truly a treat after a long day indoors in Manhattan! And not to mention tres pratique! Near great coffee and every train station you will ever need.
And it's so nice to know a portion of the fee goes to Haiti. I will stay there again and again...hope there's room, Lisel![QWERTY123]Lisel Burns offers a safe and very friendly sanctuary in a delightful part of Park Slope.  No fuss, no stress!  It felt good to contribute in some small way to her community-building vision.  Thanks, Lisel.
[QWERTY123]Enjoyed my time in this brownstone at Park Slope in Brooklyn. Lisel, the host, although busy with her community work suggested various things  for me to do which I didn't have the time to take up, unfortunately.  It was good to be able to sit in the sunny backyard and watch the squirrels and see a different part of NY - as well as meet some locals and other guests. Really easy access to the Atlantic St \Barclay Centre subway and you can get anywhere fast.[QWERTY123]Lisel was gracious enough to accommodate my friend and I even on a very short notice (we were attending a show in Manhattan coming from upstate). The room itself was spacious and the bed was very comfortable. The house itself was also eclectic and I couldn't help but gaze at the various books and cultural artifacts that rested quietly on the shelves. Overall a good experience. Thanks Lisel![QWERTY123]Lisel is great and so interesting to talk to. Great location, clean and friendly.[QWERTY123]The stay was great. SO happy to have found such a host in the same neighborhood of the venue the band was performing. Lisel was a great and welcoming host.[QWERTY123]Lisel and Betsy were very accomodating! Betsy was at work when we arrived, but she left us a key so we could get in to the house before heading to Manhattan. Both the house and room were very nice. The location is very conveniently located -- close to at least two different subway stations. We only spent one night, but when asked to leave our luggage at the house on the second day so we wouldn't have to carry it around New York, they let us do so. The only thing that caught us off guard was that we had to move from Betsy's house to Lisel's (only a short walk down the street) at 11am after our night, and we were still asleep because of the late New Year's celebrations. It wasn't that big a deal; it just surprised us.[QWERTY123]Great location, comfortable room and Lisel was a gracious host. We look forward to returning![QWERTY123]Such a charming place, full of life. The neighboorhood is very safe and there are plenty of things to do. Eventhough we just see here a few times, the host was really kind! Thanks for everything! We'll go back soon! :)[QWERTY123]Great communication. We love that we could easily change to different room #5. Lot of space , Nice light from Windows, quiet street soft bed, nice garden we could use.
Conveniënt to Subway and lovely neighbourhood. Friendly and helpful hosts[QWERTY123]The house was great as of the house keeper! A big Brownstone house, exactly what we were looking for staying in Brooklyn, we really felt like home! Private room with comfortable beds. Close to Manhattan through subway, Prospect Park in walking distance, very nice neighborhood with some restaurants and bars if you wanna hang out. Take the time to have little talk to Lisel, she's an adorable person. I would definitely recommand it :)[QWERTY123]Lisel was very friendly and welcoming, the  room nice (the bathroom very small on the first floor, but fortunately I'm short), good and very well connected area![QWERTY123]Lisel's place is a wonderful place to stay in Brooklyn! Great location in Park Slope with easy access to the subway.  Lisel was available to help with anything we may have needed during our trip. The rooms and bathrooms are comfortable, and the house is located in a quiet area. Wonderful garden! Perfect to enjoy some time outdoors or a morning cup of coffee. Will definitely be back![QWERTY123]great neighborhood.  walking distance to anything.

lisel is a warm and affable host.[QWERTY123]This rental is in a great location, very close to the center of the city. Though convenient, it still feels like a home. 

Lisel is very welcoming, providing a friendly and unique stay in New York City. If ever we had a problem or needed help, we could always find a solution with her. The environment is vibrant yet relaxed. With great company, the house makes its visitors feel like part of a community. You'll always feel safe and comfortable at Communitybegood, and have an amazing base for your trip to New York. 
[QWERTY123]Lisel's guest house has provided a friendly and convenient experience. Thanks![QWERTY123]Really nice place with a positive atmosphere.[QWERTY123]Lisel was a great host and very accommodating(especially given our late arrival). She was also very responsive and answered all of our questions thoroughly.  

The room was exactly as advertised and is in a great location.  

Overall; a great stay and highly recommended.   
[QWERTY123]The place is is prime Brooklyn location with a lot of amenities around. The host is very culturally aware and she has great values.[QWERTY123]I had a great experience there! They are really nice. Highly recommend![QWERTY123]Great location. Great hostess![QWERTY123]Great place to stay, very accommodating and for a good cause[QWERTY123]Wonderful person, I recommended 100%[QWERTY123]Couldn't ask for a better host. Lisel was very patient and accommodating  even when I was late or had problem she was calm and available to deal with it. The place is very quiet and everything is in working condition. With a fully stocked pantry there are full amenities through out the house for what ever your needs. A great location with lots of cafe/bars/ restaurants /and the famous Barclay centre just down the road.  transpotation is near by and using other shared services Uber/ Lfyt /car service/taxi are easily accessible. I wish we could of stayed around longer to partake in this old character brownstone. Thx for your patience. JahLuV.)[QWERTY123]Great location for public transportation, helps out a good cause![QWERTY123]Great room for travelers of 2 in Brooklyn, nice food and cafe around the street and a supermarket too. Lisel was really nice and helpful. There are 2 single beds but if you have really big luggage it might not be suitable for you. The room can’t be locked. Overall a recommending bnb in Brooklyn.[QWERTY123]The guest house is a warm and welcoming space near several subway stops and a solid bagel joint. Lisel is everything you could ask for in a host.[QWERTY123]La maison de Lisel c'est un peu la maison du bonheur pour les voyageurs d'Airbnb ! Emplacement parfait dans un quartier très sympa, maison typique, très accueillante, tout est fait pour que le voyageur se sente chez lui !!

55	20299	"It was a pleasure staying with Edward. He made everything very easy and it was a relaxed atmosphere, which you defintely need when dealing with such a bustling city. If you need a no fuss place to stay, Edward is your guy![QWERTY123]Edward is extremely accomodating and flexible. He gives you independents and goes out of his way to help you.

Thanks Edward![QWERTY123]The stay at Edwards place was awesome. He's a perfect roommate and is vary laid back and easy to get along with. absolutely no complaints! and perfect location as well. I recommend his place as a true NYC stay.[QWERTY123]Edward is very helpful and laid-back. I had a great experience staying with him. The apartment itself is a standard East Village one-bedroom (ie, it's in an older brick building and is not huge, but it has everything you need and the location is fantastic). The bedroom is comfortable. Edward keeps everything quite neat and clean and I had no problem coming and going as needed, even cooking a little, which made it an ideal non-hotel option for staying in New York. I would definitely stay with Edward again; it's like having a really nice roommate who also takes care of stuff for you.[QWERTY123]Edward was a great host!  He was respectful and very accommodating.  He was very laid back and it was easy to talk to him.  On top of all that, the location is great (Lower East Side, subway is close, bars/restaurants close as well).  I highly recommend anyone to stay at Edward's place!  Thanks again for everything E!

Calvin[QWERTY123]If you want to feel like a New Yorker...
Staying with Edward was the best introduction to the East Village that I could have hoped for. He knows every corner and almost everybody. He is a very easygoing host who goes out of his way to help and makes you feel very much at home and at ease. His apt is in a great location and very quiet only 5 minutes away from the subway and right next to a multitude of restaurants, bars and shops. 
I had the best time and I hope to be coming again soon!
[QWERTY123]After a lengthy trans-Atlantic journey and vibrant trip on the New York subway from JFK, Edward and his comfortable apartment welcomed the weary traveller.  He was kind, generous and helpful, inspirational in many respects. This locale in the East Village is all that one could want; such a colourful yet peaceful vibe! What's more, Edward knows that he is welcome to stay with me in London.[QWERTY123]Edward is a fantastic host, gracious and kind!!! He spent a lot of his time showing me around the city and really made me feel at home in his place. He even made me coffee in the mornings!!! He is so knowledgeable about NY and loves to share that knowledge with others. What a pleasure!!![QWERTY123]Edward is very accommodating and very flexible with my arrival and departure times.  The location is great too! Lots of restaurants nearby. You can't beat the price![QWERTY123]Edward elevated my NYC experience. The night prior to my arrival, he called me to finalize the details, even though we had established the arrangement via email, but it was a pleasant surprise to receive a phone call from the host directly.

The day of my arrival, which was ten in the morning, I arrived about twenty minutes late but Edward was gracious with his warm welcome. He laid out several tourist pamphlets on the table, shared his experiences, his love of the East Village and recommended the places to visit. Edward is very approachable, personable and a laid back host.

Admittedly, the first night I scoured my bedroom for night crawlers and I was happy to find none. During my five nights stay, I had no concerned with bugs and I was told that New York can be a problem with pests. My bedroom is a good size room with plenty of space for luggage, etc. However, I travel light so I used the laundromat that is only a few meters away - it was very convenient.

Edward's home is located in the East Village. This neighbourhood is hip, trendy, with plenty of subway lines and the bus stop is literally around the corner. It is close to St. Marks Square. Besides Soho, the East Village is my second favourite spot for exploration and living like a New Yorker. 

Overall, for the price, location and a great host who is passionate to share his flat with you, Edward's place is the place to be when in New York.

Enjoy your stay![QWERTY123]Edward is a great host. He's very warn, kind, accommodating, laid back and helpful. The location is very hip and close to everything. I definitely recommend his place for people who want to get a true NYC experience. Thank you Edward![QWERTY123]Edwardo's place in the lower east side really is a gem on itself.  As his ad says, it is truly a great place to stay and experience what it is to live in NYC.  His place is small but quaint, clean, but best of all affordable and close to a subway station and tons of bars. Also, Edwardo is a great host who has the connections to let you know of hidden gems in the city.[QWERTY123]Edward was a great host.  He's easy going, considerate and helpful.  His apartment is in an amazing location and he's willing to share the history of the East village, if you ask him.  I would stay there again if I visit in the future.[QWERTY123]Edwards love of New york was infectious I stayed 4nights  and really enjoyed my first visit.The location is excellent  with subway and dining options nearby.Edward was really helpful to the first time visitor with helpful hints on getting around and sightseeing,communication was good from booking to check out.The bedroom was quiet and sleeping was easy.I would stay here again if visiting NY.  
 (Website hidden by Airbnb) Thanks  Adrian O[QWERTY123]Eduardo was a great host! Very accommodating, personable, and informative about NY, about the best routes to get around and how to find out more neighborhood happenings! His apartment is perfectly located to wherever else in NY you are trying to go- from Brooklyn to Midtown -to Central Park! The East Village neighborhood is totally walkable with something to see and do at every turn. Eduardo was right! You do ""feel"" like a villager, apart of the neighborhood, apart of the real New York you can't see in pamphlets or on 42nd Street. And if you are traveling alone I suggest choosing Eduardo's location or similar to get that neighborhood feel. I felt safe, its a vibrant neighborhood, I met people and got to explore the real NY. It's a small apartment but big enough to be a great base camp to easily come and go to all of the activities you planned to do and see while in NY. I would definitely stay here again![QWERTY123]The place is basically close to everything, subway, bar, restaurants, etc. I didn't get time to go out at night, but my observation is there is many options if you want to enjoy a vibrant night life. The room is not a luxurious one but have a comfortable bed for you to sleep and enough privacy if you don't want to be disturbed. I also enjoy the talk with Edward. He's a very considerate and helpful and help me a lot on the public transportation in NYC. The bottom line: if you are on a tight budget and still want to stay on Manhattan while have a decent place to rest, this is the place for you.[QWERTY123]Edwar was great!
Appartament is perfect located in east village.
Have much confort and is perfect to visit Manhattan!
Edwar give you all information you neeed and help you if you have some problems.
Great Edward, when i come back in NYC i stay in your home

Leo from italy[QWERTY123]Edward was wonderful! Very helpful and knows a lot about NYC! I liked that he was very flexible and laid back, and he definitely gave me my own space during my stay. We were both in and out of the apartment which was cool.
As for location, the train is only a few blocks away and the area is VERY walkable and safe! I traveled solo and it was my first time in NYC; I found the location to be completely fine. Overall a wonderful weekend with a bonus of a new friend![QWERTY123]Edward is a great host & is very familiar with NY.  He's flexible & very easy to get along with; you shouldn't have any difficulty in ""connecting"" with him.  If you're looking for a basic place to sleep in a prime location, this is a very good option.  Keep in mind that the host does say the bed if firm (and it is).  The separate room was nice, but it can be warm on a hot day.  I would definitely stay here again![QWERTY123]Edward was a really nice host. He was very helpful and flexible. It was really easy to find his appartement and a good communication. The room was a basic nice place and in the heart of east village. Thank you very much.[QWERTY123]Edward made my first stay in NY a memorable one. He's very easygoing and knowledgable about NYC with a love for the city that is unparalled. His apt is just in one of the best spots ever with bars, restaurants, local merchants, and the subway train all within a few blocks of each other. Edward is a great host in a great location for a great price. I would definitely rent here again and again![QWERTY123]This was my first shared rental so I was not sure what to expect.  If all shared hosts are anything like Edward it will not be my last.

Edward was an outstanding host, from the last minute reservation acceptance to the attention he paid to making sure I was comfortable.

The apartment is in an outstanding location and ample street parking is available in the area.  A true East Village experience in all respects.[QWERTY123]It's a nice room in a great location, very comfortable, with a welcoming host and terrific value. Would recommend.[QWERTY123]Edwards knowledge of New York and the East Village is unparalleled. He is a really nice and knowledgeable guy and is happy to talk to you about the area and its attractions. He was always really accommodating and did his best to make the place as comfortable as possible. 

His place worked really well for my visit. Its in a great location in the East Village that is quiet but still has nightlife around it. Close to the subway and cabs so transportation isn't an issue.[QWERTY123]I RECENTLY STAYED WITH EDWARD, I HAD A GREAT TIME IN NYC, IT HAS SO MUCH GOING ON. THANKS TO EDWARDS PLACE IT MADE IT AFFORDABLE AND POSSIBLE TO COME TO NYC. EDWARD IS A STRAIGHT SHOOTER, TELL IT THE WAY IT IS, KNOWS THE CITY WELL AND GIVES YOU IDEAS TO CHECK OUT. IF YOUR GOING TO BE IN THE CITY ALL DAY THERE IS NO REASON TO PAY THE HIGH PRICES OF HOTELS, I SLEPT SHOWERED AND WAS GONE FOR THE DAY. EDWARD IS VERY EASY GOING AND FRIENDLY A GREAT GUY TO STAY WITH THANKS EDWARD, BRIAN[QWERTY123]Edward was a wonderful host. The weather turned unexpectedly wet and cold during my visit to NYC so I spent more time indoors than I had planned. Edward made me feel at home in his place and we shared some enjoyable discussions. The place is clean and very convenient to everything I was interested in. I hope to stay there again on my next visit to the city.[QWERTY123]Edward is an amazing host. Have a seat and a conversation with him and you can see behind his tattoes. He has a great knowledge about nyc and more. The apt is clean and suche a good location! thx for all :)[QWERTY123]Edward was very nice, accommodating and hospitable! A laid back and gentle guy who is very knowledgeable about NYC.[QWERTY123]Great, helpful, kind and generous host.
Great location.
I would stay there again, and again, and again...[QWERTY123]Edward was very nice and gave me a lot of information about NYC. The apt was clean and comfortable, so I could stay there like my house. Thank you very much![QWERTY123]As all the reviews said, Edward is very knowledgable and friendly. I was very comfortable and felt very welcome. The location is great and it is very easy to get around from the apartment. Edward gave great suggestions and I knew he would be there if I needed any assistance. I had the comforts of a home and it fit well into my budget. Thanks, Edward![QWERTY123]Edward is a great host. You can spend hours just listening to him talk about new york and trust me it makes exploring the city much more interesting. The room is great, everything you need with lots of privacy. Location is great as well convenient to all major new york destinations.[QWERTY123]Does Edwardo need another good review? I guess not, but it is not my fault, he was a wonderful host even if I was not the easiest guest: I checked in pretty late, waking up early and bugging him to get tips about NYC. He even was kind enough to let one my friend, who was in trouble finding a room, stay on the last night. And yes, Edwardo is a gold mine of information about NYC. He truly loves his city. If you are nice enough, he'll share a cup of his coffee (pretty strong, careful) with you and will tell you all about his East Village. So would I recommend Edwardo's place to my grand mother, no, but any traveler can book this place blindfolded. And I myself will book it again any time. It was great to meet you Ed![QWERTY123]Edward is a great host. Very friendly, flexible and laid back. He has a wealth of knowledge about the City and is very willing to help and accommodate. The place is in a wonderful location. It helped me save money while exploring the city.[QWERTY123]This was the perfect East Village apartment and Edward and Jade (his very sweet little dog) were great hosts. It's not fancy but it is clean and quiet. And so close to everything you need from food to transit to a gorgeous park.
Edward has some great stories to share and is incredibly knowledgable about the city. He is helpful and very nice to boot!
I would recommend this lovely little spot and it's very kind host to anyone. I hope to be able to come back and visit soon.[QWERTY123]What can I say about Edward! His knowledge about NY is par excellence. Basically his knowledge about the world is just fantastic which facilitates lengthy and awesome conversations.

The place is clean and very easily reachable. Moreover, Jade is such a friendly dog! It was indeed a pleasure to spend two days with super interesting Edward Arrocha!

Thank you so much, dear friend. I will definitely visit you again![QWERTY123]Edward was a very accommodating and friendly host, a very colourful and kind character who was always willing to help and offer some great tips for places and things to do in NYC. As a photographer this was especially useful to me. The apartment was clean and clean linens and bed sheets where provided as advertised. Edward is an old skool New Yorker and had plenty of interesting stories about the history of Lower East Side and the surrounding neighbourhoods. Would definitely stay again, located in a fantastic and vibrant neighbourhood.[QWERTY123]the place is perfeclty located and edward is a great host. it couldn't have been better. i'll definetly go back when i'm in nyc again![QWERTY123]Edward is a very special person. He cares about the welfare of his guests and has it as a priority. Very interested in the culture of New York, he suggests very interesting itineraries and tours for those who want to discover the nooks and charms of NYC. During my stay in NY, he suggested a nice walk through the Lower East Side and side where I took wonderful photos! He also suggested a traditional anual festival in Coney Island that if weren't for his suggestion I would never know. Finally, I had some free rides thanks to the indications of Edward! Staying in his apartment is very pleasant and if you have difficulties with the English language he can talk to you in Spanish or French. All I can do is thank him for all the learning, courtesy and friendship![QWERTY123]The room is huge and, even though it's not air conditioned, stays cool with the nice fan. The location is great! Edward is very kind and full of interesting stories about how the area has changed. It's not immaculately clean, but overall a good space for the price; I would stay there again if I was looking for a place.[QWERTY123]Easy. Only stayed for 2 nights, and I was out most of the day. The fan helped at night in the summer. But that's about it. Ed was easy going, and  helpful.[QWERTY123]Had a great stay with Edward.

He's an incredibly interesting person and went out of his way to make me feel welcome.  Plus the location is amazing.

Would stay here again without hesitation.[QWERTY123]Edward is a very interesting and welcoming guy. The apartment was in such an amazing spot in LES and for that price you can't go wrong!! He had a lot to say about the history of LES in New York and how he's seen it change over the years which is great for anyone interested in the real New York.

Thanks so much for your hospitality Edward, I will definitely stay again next time I'm in New York![QWERTY123]Edward was a wonderful host, with all sorts of great local knowledge and stories of the neighborhood. The room is spacious, clean and well-kept, and the neighborhood can't be beat for things to do.[QWERTY123]Edward is one of those rare human beings completely filled with kindness and compassion. He made me feel welcome in his home and was an amazing source of information about the East Village and NYC in general. I could have listened to his stories all day! Thank you Edward for making my stay so memorable and opening up your apartment to me. I hope to meet you again one day.[QWERTY123]Edward is a great host with a knowledge of NewYork and the Lower East side that is hard to top. His appartment is located in the heart of the Lower East Side and not to far away from the train and other interesting sites in the area. 

The room we rented was  suitable for our three days stay. I would always rent from Edward again.[QWERTY123]Edward is great and he can recommend some good place to see and eat. The room is good and bed was comfortable I found it very easy to get into the central city from Edward's place I also felt save in the area. I would recommend this listing to any one looking for a affordable friendly and place in New York.[QWERTY123]My stay was wonderful - You get your own room and Edward is a really nice guy. He is very low key and is a big help with directions. I felt more like a house guest by the end of the trip. Thanks, Edward, for helping make my trip memorable.[QWERTY123]Edward was an excellent host, very helpful and kind, made sure my stay was the most pleasant possible, I can only thank him for everything, your room is very comfortable and provided me with excellent nights rest after long hikes in NY. I definitely recommend Edward's house to anyone who wants to spend quality time in this wonderful city, because besides everything he still gave me valuable tips about the city and how to get around it. I am very grateful to Edward.[QWERTY123]Edward was a warm, kind and gracious host who made my stay in NYC completely enjoyable. His place is quaint, and clean. A real slice of what it is to be a real, boots on the ground New Yorker. Edward is an incredible conversationalist who will regail you with stories if you have the opportunity to. I can not recommend him enough both as a host to  stay with and as a person in general.[QWERTY123]Staying at Edward's house was a wonderful experience.
My flight was cancelled because of the storm and I arrived to days later than expected. I could change my reservation dates without any problem.
Edward's advice was really useful during my fists two days in NYC, and talking to him was really interesting.
The house is not very big, but located in a perfect area. 
The bathroom was clean and the bedroom comfortable and quiet.
[QWERTY123]large clean room with comfortable bed and bathroom, 1.5 block from F line,  great neighbourhood, walkable to a number of good restaurants including Katz's.  edward was most accomodating to my schedule and kept me entertained with great stories.[QWERTY123]You see a different NYC after talking with Edward. Never have I met a person who loves this city that much, if you're totally new to NYC you should choose to stay with him and learn every corner of the city. Location is pretty nice, close to lots of great dinning spots. My departure time was really early (4 in the morning) and thank you Edward for being considerate to that.[QWERTY123]Edward is an excellent and interesting host who knows the history of every back alley of lower Manhattan. As a female traveling alone I felt completely safe staying in his apartment. He is caring in a very respectful way. You get your own room with a comfortable and clean bed and towels, a good shower and good heating in the winter. As stated before in other reviews it's not a luxury hotel, but more than enough for my needs. The location is great in the heart of Manhattan with walking distance to everything. Thank you Edward for sharing your time and stories with me. I hope to return. //Sara[QWERTY123]I had a great time with Edward. He is very welcoming and loves to help out with any qestions you might have about the city. His inside knowledge is great, especially if this is your first time to NYC.
Edward always tried to make my stay as comfortable as possible.[QWERTY123]Thank you, Edward. Everything was good. Appartament is in very interesting hood, highly recomend to all airbnb users![QWERTY123]Edward is an amazing host: He knows the city and its history and he's willing to share some amazing tips. Make sure you go those places he suggests! He also gives you the privacy when you want it. The room is quite big, given the fact thats its nyc after all, its also very quiet so noises wont bother your sleep.[QWERTY123]It was a whirlwind weekend trip to the city for a family event-- my first trip to the city and my first airbnb stay. A perfect introduction to the city was found in Edward. His apartment was easy to find and easy to get to from other locations in the city. I highly recommend him to women traveling alone (unless you are high-maintenance, then I encourage you to get a hotel).

I did not get a chance to take advantage of all he suggested, but will most definitely return to do do. We discovered a mutual friend, who he was able to connect me with, which turned into the highlight of my trip. Philosopher, poet, historian, fisherman-- all in all Renaissance man. Being new to the city, it was refreshing to visit with someone so relaxed and easy-going. Many thanks, Edward, you are a gem.[QWERTY123]I stayed with Edward for a week on a business trip. He is superfriendly, willing to help and full of great stories about NYC. My sister used to live a few blocks away so I am familiar with the neighbourhood, which was the driver for my choosing Edward's place. The East Village is good if you're looking for bargain but safe and convenient accommodation. PS I tried the masseur right downstairs and it was good![QWERTY123]Edward - Thanks a lot for hosting me! 
He is a great guy - in any respect. I had a great time with him. He knows a lot of details of his town NYC.
He was very helpful.Edward: I´ll be back!
;-)[QWERTY123]Edward was a great host, and his apartment is very conveniently located for exploring  the East Village and Manhattan. Edward gave me useful tips for exploring the city, and we had several interesting conversations - it was really great to get genuine insight into life in the city. Edward is respectful and easy going and was flexible on my arrival and departure times - overall this was a great first airbnb experience, many thanks Edward![QWERTY123]Edward was totally easy going and flexible. His simple rules aren't arduous to follow at all, and the location was great. It's a small place, and nothing fancy, but he doesn't misrepresent that at all in the ad. So as far as meeting my expectations, I'm giving him full marks.[QWERTY123]Edward has lots of stories that make the Lower East Side come alive. His humble apartment is comfortable and close to everything or to the subway where every place is accessible. This is a taste of New York you could not find elsewhere.[QWERTY123]Edward was the perfect host. His apt. is located very near the metro and broadway and all shops. The room was clean & tidy and he was always willing to share a story or assist whenever needed. I'd recommend staying at his place.[QWERTY123]Edward is a very interesting fellow and easy to get along with, I enjoyed talking with him about his experiences over time in New York. The accommodations weren't fancy, as he described up front, but were quite satisfactory and quiet.[QWERTY123]Edward is very accommodating host! It was a pleasure to meet him and to hear some stories about NYC. 

I'm very thankful to Ed for his flexibility when I had to adjust my travel plans!

Highly recommended![QWERTY123]I had a fantastic time in New York City. Edward is absolutely easy going. He knows so much about his city and gave me a lot of very helpful tips on how to explore this great city. His apartment is situated perfectly to get an impression of the real City of New York. From there you can discover so many things just by walking through the blocks. Although his apartment is so central, it is a very quiet place, where you can recover perfectly from strenuous days.

Thank you Edward. I would love to come back!
[QWERTY123]The room is exactly what Edward describes, he makes it a point that he's welcoming you to his home not a hotel. He knows a lot about NY and its history, he had tons of suggestions for things to do.[QWERTY123]Edward was a fantastic host - like everyone before me has said already, he is so knowledgeable about NYC, he helped me with so many handy tips about what to see and how to get around, that it would've been a lot harder without him!  He made me feel so welcome in his home - he was very laid back and understood when I needed to shower after getting home very late, waking him up! Sorry about that Edward!  He's a really interesting guy with a great spirit - he will now be a great part of my New York memories. 
The room was clean, fresh bedsheets and fluffy towels, two big fans to help keep you cool and a nice clean bathroom to use whenever you need that freshen-up shower!  The area is also really cool because you get to see a part of New York which you probably wouldn't see if you were staying in Midtown.  It feels more 'real' in Lower East Side.  Also close to subway stations, grocery and drug stores and other interesting areas.

Overall great first experience in New York City!  Thanks for your help Edward :-)[QWERTY123]As soon as you enter Edward's apartment you know you're in authentic New York. It's not flash, designer or big, doesn't have a view, it's fairly compact, in fact a bit cluttered, and low key. But it's clean, quiet, and a real treat to have as a base.  Edward communicated clearly his expectations of me as a guest, then left the rest up to me. He's a very considerate and kind host, with whom you can choose to converse with or not, whatever suits.  He's also an encyclopedia of info, has a great take on life, and I felt really well looked after. Thanks, Edward[QWERTY123]Stayed with Mr. Arrocha an extremely hot weekend in New York.  He was a pleasant host.  The room was adequate, but not air-conditioned and had no window.  It was extremely hot.  The room provided was clean, as was the bathroom, though the rest of the house was littered indiscriminately.  New York is expensive, so I probably got my money's worth.[QWERTY123]Edward is a very nice host and can tell you a lot about NY. I really enjoyed my stay at his place; it is very conveniently located, very authentic and you're in the middle of things and still it is quiet and you get a good night's sleep. The room you get is not big or fancy, but has a big bed, TV,  chair, chest of drawers and a place to hang some clothes. It is wall-to-wall with the kitchen (you see the door to the room on the pictures) but not noisy. His apartment is basic, a little used, and not big (so just as he describes it), but it is clean and everything works etc.
I can recommend a stay at his place![QWERTY123]Edward was a fantastic host and a great help to me during the most stressful part of my trip after I had misplaced my luggage. He kept things in perspective and reminded me that I shouldn't let it ruin my trip, and for that I am very grateful. 

It was also interesting to hear about how different areas in NY have changed over time and to get tips on some less tourist-y places to visit. Would definitely stay with him again![QWERTY123]Edward was very helpful with recommending things for me to do during my stay. I'd recommend him to anyone going to visit NYC.[QWERTY123]Edward is a very nice host who can tell you a lot about NYC. His flat is very well located and the neighborhood is safe. On warm days, he can also provide you with fans which are extremely helpful. I can definitely recommend you to stay at his place.[QWERTY123]edward arrocha es un interessante caballero, gran conocedor de nyc, la axctudalidad y bla vida aquí, un hombre que lee mucho, y que sabe lo que desea en la vida.... no hay duda que es un gran 
conocedor de si mismo y lo que desea y espera...[QWERTY123]Edward is a lovely guy and I enjoyed our morning chats before I'd head out.  His place is in a great location with a subway a few blocks away and a deli across the street for morning coffee.  I would recommend staying here.  Thanks for hosting me Edward![QWERTY123]Had a great time in the city! Ed is very hospitable, respectful, and just plain cool. The room is exactly how it is described. The location could not be any better either! East Village is a great place to stay. Would definitely recommend![QWERTY123]Edward is a very courteous host. It was a very enjoyable, pleasant stay.[QWERTY123]J'ai logé chez Edward dans l'East Village. C'est un quartier que je recommande chaudement pour quelques jours à NYC. Un peu à l'écart de effervescence de la mégapole, ce quartier reste à taille humaine, avec de petits endroits pour déjeuner qui ne semblent pas impersonnels, des gens qui marchent moins vite qu'ailleurs, un p'tit coin vraiment sympa. Edward grand amoureux de sa ville s'est toujours rendu disponible pour m'expliquer ou me conseiller sur mes visites ou les chemins à emprunter. Le matin je partais entre 8 h 30 et 9 h 00 aprés ma douche pour ne revenir au moins aprés 21 h 00 pour me coucher. Je n'ai vraiment utilisé la chambre chez Edward que pour y dormir la nuit. Je considère que j'étais chez quelqu'un et non à l'hotel ; ce qui à mes yeux ne m'autorise pas à passer du temps dans le salon de mon hote à trainer une partie de la matinée ou de l'aprés midi. J'étais là pour profiter de la ville uniquement. NYC est une ville où l'on marche beaucoup. Si je devais conseiller quelqu'un, je lui dirais de privilégier le bus qui permet de découvrir la ville et qui est somme toute assez rapide (la ville n'est pas bouchée en permanence comme l'est Paris que je connais bien)[QWERTY123]I spent 5 nights in Edward´s appt and as a first Airbnb experience, it was excellent! Edward is a very nice and flexible host who can tell you (in English and in French!!!!!) all you want to know about NYC. His flat is very well located and the neighborhood is really safe even late, easy to get to subway & Bus. The room was perfect for me:  It is clean and quiet (this is a home, not a hotel). I highly recommend the place to women traveling alone. Many thanks Edward for making my first stay in NYC so great!!! I'll definitely come back to stay at Edward's home again.[QWERTY123]Best place to come stay in New York! Edward is an amazing air B&B host with a knowledge and passion for New York that is second to none. Definitely my best experience so far. The location is amazing, room is comfortable and clean and is perfect for your New York experience :)[QWERTY123]Location of the flat is good. very close to subway. basic and comfortable room, accommodating host. if you are on a budget and will be spending most of your day visiting NYC, this is a great spot.[QWERTY123]It was my first time in NY and I had a wonderful stay! The apartment is very good located. So I walked a lot and discovered the city by foot. But the subway station is close too. Edward is a friendly and interesting guy and knows a lot about NY and the different districts. The apartment is simple but there is everything you need and the room is quiet and I slept very well. I had a great time in NY and I can only recommend Edward as host.[QWERTY123]I spent 3 nights at Edward Arrocha’s place and enjoyed it much. Edward was a great host to stay with -  fun, smart, intelligent and a great guy to speak with about almost any topic possible. He is a walking encyclopedia of NYC and fishery,  and can provide you with wonderful ideas about the city and what it has to offer (even for the experienced traveler who’s been to NYC many times). 
The place is basic and is certainly what one should expect for such a rate in NYC. I did not expected otherwise, and had a great stay. My room was comfortable and clean.There are lots of restaurants, cafes and transportation options around. I definitely recommend.[QWERTY123]Edward is a very nice guy. He truly loves NYC and can tell you lots of interesting facts about it. If you want to see smth besides the famous attractions you can ask him and I am sure he knows smth you will like.

The apartment had all I needed. Location is very good: close to subway, chinatown; walking distance from Union square and many other interesting places.[QWERTY123]You will hardly find someone with more knowledge of NYC. Edward was a very welcoming host, always willing to share his insights. The location is great, close to all sorts of restaurants and very convenient for transportation. A+[QWERTY123]Edward's apartment was precisely what I was looking for when I looked on Air BnB for somewhere cool and affordable to stay in New York for the week. In fact, it exceeded my expectations. I can't imagine anything nearly as good for the price. 

Great location, cool, laid-back atmosphere, welcoming hosts. The transport connections/amenities are fantastic. The nearest subway station is a few minutes walk away and has easy access to Brooklyn/Manhattan/Queens.

All in all - highly recommended, would visit again.[QWERTY123]Edward,
You are warm hosts with a desire to enrich the experiences of stay in the city. Because of you, I started to learn about the soul of the neighborhood and the city. You have good advice and amazing knowledge of the city. 
Thanks[QWERTY123]I had a wonderful stay at Edward´s place! He is a very welcoming host, has a great passion for New York, and can give you many off the track advice on where to go in the city (according to your own interests). His apartment is close to the F train and major bus lines, so very easy to get around town. This is definitely the best option to go if you are looking for a clean, basic, well located and affordable place to stay in New York. Would go back anytime.[QWERTY123]Edward is an excellent host.  His place is clean, comfortable, convenient, and quiet. The location (smack in the middle of the East Village) makes for almost endless interesting stuff to do and see. Edward has almost encyclopedic understanding/knowledge of the city.  Every establishment he recommended turned out to be ""spot on"".  I would stay here again, absolutely.[QWERTY123]The room and apt was exactly as advertised. Edward is a wonderful host, knowledgable about NYC and the neighborhood, and ready to help out if I ever got lost or in trouble. Edward is one of my favorite hosts I've met on Airbnb. And the neighborhood is my favorite in the city so, if you're looking for a good, friendly, affordable place to rest your body after a day of exploring, this is the place to be.[QWERTY123]Edward was very respectful and flexible, I told him that I would arrive between 8-10pm on my first night, but then I ran a little late, so I called him to let him know, then he waited for me (as he was about to go to bed). Awesome host!  And there's no set check-out time.  Edward can basically accommodate your need as long as it's reasonable.

Other than that, the location was great, close to the subway, few blocks from all subway lines.  Bars/restaurants are within walking distance, also the location is close to St Mark's[QWERTY123]If you want a real Downtown experience it is your place to be! Edward is a great host, he really LOVES New York like only oldtimer can and he can tell you all the hidden places, where you won't see any tourists! The spots!

Area is amazing, all the great parts of the Downtown are walking distance away.
I really enjoyed my time exploring the City and Ed's apt was a great base to do that![QWERTY123]This apartment was exactly as advertised and if you are a single traveler looking for a private room and space to keep your stuff while you explore the city, it is ideal.

Edward is a great host as he is friendly, knowledgeable and very accommodating. As long as you appreciate what you are getting for this excellent value price in the heart of the East Village, you'll be fine here.[QWERTY123]Edward was a very accommodating and friendly host. He definitely knows his stuff about New York! He has heaps of great tips and suggestions. The location is also such a gem. There are so many amazing bars and restaurants in the area I was sad I couldn't stay longer. I felt very safe and slept extremely well. The room was quiet and comfortable which was a welcome change from the noisy motel I had come from. This is a great spot if you're a solo traveler who wants to see a little more than just the generic tourist attractions. Thanks Edward! ;)[QWERTY123]Edward is great! I didn't get much time to hang out because I was busy in the city but the room and bathroom were clean and I slept just fine! Edward thank you so much! Perfect spot for artists! LES and Williamsburg easy access. If you are an artist and are looking for a simple, minimal set up, go with Edward. Peace![QWERTY123]I had an awesome time staying at Edward's place. The location is very convenient. You can get around town by subway or by bus very easily. The neighborhood is quite exciting, too, with lots of bars and restaurants. Edward is a great host. He loves NYC passionately, knows everything about it, and is more than willing to offer advice about where to go and what to do around town.[QWERTY123]Summary:  If you are looking for a cheap place to just sleep and shower, and are not picky, this could be a good choice for you.
Pros: 
-Edward is a great host - very friendly and super helpful!  Note: he has tattoos all over his arms and face, which can make him seem intimidating at first. (he even said so himself). But he is very kind and trustworthy.  
-Great location. Lots of restaurants & bars within walking distance & easy to get around on the subway. I felt safe walking back from the subway late at night.
-Inexpensive
-Quiet
-The important things were clean - e.g. the bed sheets, towels, and bathroom were clean. 
Cons:
-The overall apt. was only marginally clean. Lots of clutter, scuffs on the walls, small hole in my door, stains on the chair, etc. Note: my door did not have a lock on it (which was fine - I had no issues - but just mentioning it in case that matters to you).
-No air conditioning, but there were 2 fans in the room. This was only problematic because the first day I was there it was over 90 degrees.  There are no windows in the room so it got quite hot and stuffy, which intensified all of the smells of the city and some kind of cooking smell in the apartment (I can't place what it was?)  The bed is OK, but IMO not as comfortable as some people have said.  It was hard to sleep that night.  But it cooled down to the mid-80's the next 2 days, which made it much more tolerable, and then I slept fine. 

While this is not necessarily a pro or a con, I want to make it clear that Edward sleeps in the living room (the listing said that it is ""his space"", but I wasn't totally sure what that meant when I read the description).  I actually barely saw him because I was out of the apt. so much, so this was fine.  Like I said, I was only there to sleep and shower, so I appreciated having a cheap place to stay on a last-minute trip.  I also felt safe staying there as a woman traveling solo. Thanks to Edward for his hospitality![QWERTY123]Edward was a very nice man and helpful with information about the city and neighborhood.   His apartment is in a fantastic and vibrant neighborhood that I really enjoyed.   For those wanting a bed to sleep in, a good starting point and flexibilty, this place is for you.  For those needing a little more in amenities, it probably isn't for you.   My only concern was the cleanliness of the room, as I was not certain the sheets were clean.  If that part of the situation is improved, this place will be fine for independent travelers.[QWERTY123]What a wonderful place!

Edward is incredibly accommodating and knowledgeable about the city; it was my first time in NYC and he was able to give me a good picture of the area, along with some history and background, and recommended many places to check out. He is so friendly and chill, really made my week a pleasant one. Additionally, to cope with the intense heat that the city was experiencing at the time, he had plenty of fans going, which felt great after a day of walking around.

The room is tidy and has plenty of space for someone who will spend most of their time out and about in the city. The apartment is close to subway stations and within walking distance of several great places to eat and see live music (one could easily walk to Mercury Lounge, Bowery Electric, Bowery Ballroom, Arlene's Grocery). The neighborhood is vibrant bustling with life, even at night. Honestly, this location was ideal for me. Would definitely come back!
[QWERTY123]Edward was a very nice and friendly host. He lives downtown NYC, which makes it ""easy"" for Manhattan-sightseeing. His ""rules"" for guests are totally comprehensible and have met my opinion. 
As you can see already on his site, he has good advices for visiting the city were useful. A place to go back.[QWERTY123]Edward was a great host, very friendly and invited, it was very nice to talk to him about different subject, get recommendations on places to go, eat. The place was as in the pictures, and the location was great. 
[QWERTY123]Edward is one of the nicest hosts I've met on AirBnB. He was very welcoming and has encyclopedic knowledge of New York - forget your Lonely Planet, this guy knows it all and more. It is very conveniently located in the Lower East Side. It is very close to the metro and the surrounding area has loads of bars, restaurants and is alive all the time, it really gives you that cool Manhattan feel. However, you get what you pay for. The place is a good price for a private room in Manhattan in such a great location. The place is a little run down, for example the shower didn't have a shower head and the fans were very dusty, I found dust over my bed after leaving one on.  There is no AC but the room has two fans. It got pretty hot but it was ok while I was there when the temperature was in the mid 80's, any hotter and it might be uncomfortable. Ed sleeps in the living room and you have to go through there to get to the bathroom. I had no problem at night going in there to brush my teeth without waking him. Ed was a really cool host, he let me leave my bags until the evening, well after the check out time. As long as you are just looking for a place to crash, shower, something that is cheap and not looking for luxury or to hangout then this will work.[QWERTY123]Leave your guidebook at home, Edward will tell you everything you need to know about New York plus he makes you feel a home straight away. As descriped you are staying in somebodys  home so do not expect that everything is as tidy as in a hotel Room. But bed and bathroom are clean. Bedroom is quiet and dark and matrass comfortable so you can have a good night rest before you start exploring this fantastic neighbourhood and the rest of the city.
[QWERTY123]Edward is a wonderful host. The very first day we spent more than one hour talking about the city and all the possible places i could visit, with plenty of tips coming from his decade-long experience living in New York. The appartment is cozy and nestled in the middle of East Village, great and super-safe place for both bars and clubs at night, or hanging around by day.[QWERTY123]Edward's place is as described: comfortable bed in a private room.  The location is just a short walk from the subway; many restaurants and groceries just steps away.  You do share the bathroom with the owner.  It's a perfect place for someone just want a play to sleep and shower.  It needs updates but clean.

Edward make great suggestions of places to see.  He is very down-to-earth and nice to talk to.
[QWERTY123]Great host and the place is really good. Specially if you go for few days, very well located and Edward helped me a lot with tips and directions... Awesome experience with a world citizen like Edward[QWERTY123]Edward is a great host.
He gave a very warm welcome and quick tour of his apartment.  The room is private, and Edward respects this privacy.

Location is supreme.
Not only are the subways nearby, the location is near famous East Village staples including Katz's Deli, Russ & Daughters, and Please Don't Tell.[QWERTY123]Edward is a very polite and considerate host. He is very transparent with his potential guests so ask questions. Don't be offended if he decides not to accept your request because most likely he doesn't feel that his place will accommodate to your needs. If you want a simple and quiet place to stay with a very knowledgeable host, you won't be disappointed. There are no bells and whistles here, just a comfortable bed and great host.[QWERTY123]Edward is a really great person with a ton of knowledge. I appreciated staying with him. 

I was very busy running around New York and exploring. I used the guest room as more of a crash pad. I slept and showered there. Other than that, I was running around. 

That worked well with me. 

I really found Edward to be a pleasure to talk to and a great host.[QWERTY123]Effectivement, l'appartement est très bien situé... mais avant tout, Edward est un homme incroyable, qui m'a fait découvrir New York sous un autre aspect.[QWERTY123]Edward was a most hospitable host. He welcomed me into his home and was there with help and guidance for both the neighborhood and New York City in general.  He went beyond what was required when I was stranded in New York because of the Jan 25th blizzard. He allowed me to stay in his home for no additional charge. I truly appreciate this. It shows his true nature and I thank him very much.[QWERTY123]I stayed 5 days at Edward's and I really felt at home. He's very kind and we talked about so many things- it seems he lived ten lives!
Edward's appartment is on the quiet part of the East Village, which means you can enjoy an amazing neighbourhood without suffering the noise. 
I would absolutely reccomend staying at Edward's and I'm so grateful to him for making New York a much friendlier place.[QWERTY123]It was a pleasure to stay with Edward.  Edward provided me lots of good advice on travelling in New York, which are particularly useful as this was the first time I travel to NY, and I very much enjoyed chatting with him.  

His apartment is in a safe neighbourhood and it takes only a short walk to the nearest subway station. I stayed outside quite late one night for a broadway show, but I didn't feel in anyway uncomfortable during my brief walk from the station as there were still quite a lot of people in the streets at night.

As for Edward's one-room studio apartment, I stayed in the bedroom with a large comfortable bed and Edward stayed in the living room.  At times there were some sounds from the pipes but overall they didn't bother me a lot and I had very good sleep for all nights.

I will certainly stay with Edward again when I travel to NY next time.  Thanks a lot, Edward, for your hospitality and do drop me a call if you come by Hong Kong![QWERTY123]Edwards home was exactly was I was looking for. A place to sleep and take a shower after exploring all day the city. It is located a  in very nice and interesting neighbourhood, 2/3 blocks from the F line (4 min walking) and there are some beatiful parks and bars with music around. Edward is very warm, knows the city and it's history in a real way and didn't have any problem in giving you great advices. It was a pleasure, so I hope to return someday[QWERTY123]Good location and welcomed host. I’ve got everything I need room, bed and shower.[QWERTY123]Milles merci à Edward, c'est quelqu'un de très accueillant et toujours disponible pour offrir ses conseils!
C'est un vrai New Yorkais, exactement comme je souhaitais en rencontrer, c'était super de partager avec quelqu'un qui aime autant sa ville, j'étais toujours ravie de lui raconter toute mes découvertes et d'entendre les siennes c'est quelqu'un de formidable et de généreux qui vous fera vous sentir comme chez vous!
C'est toujours agréable quand on vient seule de pouvoir échanger avec son hôte en rentrant!
C'était mon rêve de découvrir New York et j'ai eu l'impression d'y vivre pendant presque 2 semaines!
Le lit est très confortable et c'est très sympa après une grande journée de marche !
L'appartement est très bien situé à quelques minutes du métro peut être 5 ou 10 minutes! Même en rentrant tard seule il n'y avait aucun souci il y a toujours du monde dans les rues!
J'espère pouvoir revenir chez Edward dès que possible c'est quelqu'un de passionnant mais qui vous laisse aussi votre intimité si besoin c'est un super colocataire et un super hôte! 
Il faut prendre son temps pour découvrir cette ville magnifique les gens sont toujours ravie de vous aider ou de vous renseigner et Edward incarne très bien celà!
Merci encore Edward, take care !
Audrey

[QWERTY123]It was great staying with Edward. He knows a lot about New York and it was a delight talking to him. The place is nice and is very close to the subway.[QWERTY123]Really great host! Edward is super sweet and knows all the ins and outs of NYC and his neighborhood. He gave me a bunch of food suggestions and site seeing tips, and his place is very easy to reach from the airport and close to several train lines for getting further into Manhattan. I stayed there for work and it was just what I needed- a safe place to stay, not a lot of hanging around in the apartment. The room is private, incredibly quiet (surprising for such a busy city), comfy bed, everything he says in the description. I would absolutely stay here again and would recommend Edward as a host.[QWERTY123]During my staying, I could stay in confort.
Especially, the location is nice, close to various stores, bars, subway startion, therefore, to go downtown was easiler than I expected.
And also, Edward supported me well.
He tried to give me a sound advice, accutally, his advice always helped me to do things during staying in NY.

From above, if I have anothre opportunity to come back here, I will stay here again, and also I recommend persom, who plan to stay in NY.[QWERTY123]Ho soggiornato da Edward per 9 notti e mi sono trovata benissimo. Lui è molto disponibile, mi ha fornito consigli sulla città e la sua personale visione delle cose. Ho apprezzato molto la cosa, mi ha aiutata veramente a farmi una idea di NYC. La casa è quella che si vede nella foto, non si vede solo la stanza in cui si dorme, la quale non è altro che una stanza con un letto matrimoniale, una cassettiera e dei ventilatori, più gli asciugamani che ci fornisce per uso personale. Di notte si sentono un po' di rumori da fuori, ma non ho avuto mai avuto problemi a dormire. 
Personalmente l'ho trovato un ottimo compromesso. La zona è ottima, in pochi minuti a piedi si raggiungono diverse fermate della metro e si va ovunque. Parlando di sicurezza, la zona l'ho trovata molto frequentata, anche tornando a casa a tarda sera mi sono sempre sentita tranquilla. Ricapitolando, l'alloggio di per sé è spartano, fornisce il minimo che serve al turista che va in giro tutto il giorno: un letto per dormire e un bagno per farsi la doccia (anche la cucina, ma non l'ho mai usata). La zona è ben collegata e l'ho trovata sicura. Edward è disponibilissimo a dare consigli. Se non si è troppo schizzinosi e si vuole visitare NYC per parecchi giorni senza spendere una fortuna (stando comunque in un buona zona) questo allora è un ottimo posto.[QWERTY123]Ed's place was perfect for what I needed - a base of operations to explore the city, and a great location from which to do so! Ed himself was extremely hospitable, and always eager to help or answer any questions I had about the city.[QWERTY123]Edward es un gran hombre, amable y disponible y sobretodo un pozo de informaciones! La casa no es grande pero poco importa, tiene lo que uno necesita, una cama comoda para descansar; está perfectamente ubicada y la zona es vivaz pero tranquila, nunca me sentí en peligro. Gracias Edward, lo pasé genial![QWERTY123]If you want to enjoy New York, to walk the streets, to spend time outside... anyway, if you like to visit: this place is very convenient. Do not expect to find a very luxurious apartment,  but who cares? There's a comfortable bed and a invigorating shower! And most of all: Edward really helps you organizing your trip. His precious advice about transport, better spots to take pictures of Manhattan, tricks to enjoy the city as a New-Yorker are so useful![QWERTY123]Appartement très bien situé, très calme aussi. Beaucoup de deli et de restaurant aux alentours. 
Edward est un très gentil hôte. Très généreux en conseils et en attention, respecteux envers ses invités et respectueux de leur espace. 
L'appartement manque juste d'une petite touche féminine.[QWERTY123]Don't have anything to add to the numerous previous reviews about Edward. Recommend![QWERTY123]Edward is a wonderful host, he helped me with my suitcases and provided all the information about his apartment. Also he helped me getting around the city and gave really useful tips about places to go, things to see.  I enjoyed my stay here especially because Edward made me feel welcomed.

The apartment is in a really nice area with a lot of bars and restaurants, very safe and most of all, quite close to the metro and bus stations. The room is a bit small but it's perfect if you're a tourist, it provides everything that you need in order to rest after a long day of walking in NYC.[QWERTY123]Edward is one of the nicest people I've met in a long while.  He was a very welcoming, informative, and kind host, willing to share stories and perspectives and a wealth of knowledge about NYC.  For anyone looking to experience the city on a budget, in particular, he can be helpful.  His description of the apartment is correct, and as he put it his place is probably best for people who are ""between hostels and hotels""; it's certainly no frills, but the bed is comfortable, there are drawers and closet space open for your clothes, and the subway is just about 5 minutes from his front door and takes you all over Manhattan.  The Lower East is an interesting neighborhood, too, and within easy walking distance I found great pizza and super pastrami, with lots of other options.  This is a particularly good option for single travelers as the bedroom is a little cramped for two maybe (though the bed is a queen), but if you're mainly looking for a place to crash while exploring or conferencing during the day I'd say give it a whirl.[QWERTY123]I found Edward to be very delightful and intelligent. As a woman I felt very safe and comfortable staying at his Airbnb. He gave me thorough instructions on how to navigate the subways which made my trip more enjoyable  and action-packed. My room was quiet. I had a good night sleep every night. I felt safe in the neighborhood  during the day and in the late evening. This location is close the subways with easy access to Manhattan touristy areas. I  would stay here again if I have a chance to come to New York again[QWERTY123]Edward is the reason you should stay here.   He is a very kind, trustworthy and wonderful host who loves intelligent conversation and is really into getting to know new people.   His apartment is perfect for those who want an affordable NYC stay in the East Village/Lower East Side.   It's also near the subway (F train - orange line) which made it easy to get around the city.  The neighborhood is endlessly fascinating; the apartment quite safe; the room nice and cozy; and the bed so comfortable that I slept like a baby every night.  If ever I do visit NYC, again, I would stay with Edward in a heartbeat![QWERTY123]great stay! recommended! edward hosted very nicely. quite room, great place, and very safe. ask him where is good place in nyc. he knows all.[QWERTY123]Great guest - nicely located and very quiet room![QWERTY123]First of all, this is a great place to stay for budget travelers. If you want to stay in decent hotels or expect a nice & luxurious room, this is not for you ;) Location is almost a center of East Village and close enough to public transportation (tip: buy unlimited MTA card if you want to stay more than 4 days). You can find many local restaurants near from the house. 
Edward is really easy-going and nice. You can get a lot of tips from him and I'd recommend following most of them (you can't follow all of them I guess).[QWERTY123]Edward was amazing host - seriously knows everything about the city! Room is small but does the job, especially if you are just looking for a place to rest your head at night. Walking distance to tons of good food and bars, and trains. Would absolutely stay again![QWERTY123]Edward honestly made my experience! He's incredibly knowledgable, flexible, accommodating and friendly! He really cares about your time there and it comes across a million times over. Would highly recommend him and his humble abode to anyone venturing into NYC![QWERTY123]Edward is amazing. I was blown away by his friendliness and generosity. He really helped me find my way around. It was a treat to stay with him for a week![QWERTY123]Edward is an amazing individual, there was no photo of the room so i was a little big scared, but actually turned out amazing. If you are searching for a bed and hospitality this is the best choice. Edward always offers to make your stay in the city a little bit better. Not a 5 star hotel, but a pretty nice place to stay. Whenever i come back i will repeat.

Edward es una persona majisima, sabe muchisimo de nueva york y sus calles, es un autentico explorardor urbano jajajajaa. Siempre te va a ayudar dandote direcciones o proponiendote cosas. Te da muchisima libertad con un respeto mutuo. No se quejo en ningún momento de absolutamente nada y fue todo muy cómodo, sin duda repito aquí la próxima vez que venga. Merece mas la pena un sitio así que un hotel de 5 estrellas, vives y sientes Nueva York[QWERTY123]Edward was an excellent host - super friendly, welcoming, and knowledgable. He responded promptly to pre-trip inquiries and was there exactly when he said he would be for check-in. 
I was pretty much only there to sleep and it was exactly what I needed. Close to where I needed to be, easy to get to, and lots of great inexpensive food recommendations (I ate at more than half of them). When I'm back in the city, I'll be sure to check to see if his place is available, you can't beat it for price and location.[QWERTY123]立地もよく､ﾆｭｰﾖｰｸに慣れている人にｵｽｽﾒです｡
ｴﾄﾞﾜｰﾄﾞは､何でも詳しく教えてくれます｡そして寛大で優しいです｡
部屋は､可愛い個室です｡
でも､共有空間もありますから､綺麗に利用できる人がよいと思います｡[QWERTY123]This was my first visit to New York, and I loved It! Edward was the perfect host. He is passionate about his love of New York. He gave me all of the information needed for travel.
As a single female traveler, I felt safe. I will definitely recommend for anyone who wants to visit. 
Central location. I caught the subway every night to go to a different Broadway show. It was close to his apartment. 
I even had to call a couple of times when I got lost and he was more than willing to help.[QWERTY123]Edward is very nice and welcome person. He loves and knows New York like his palm. The house is small and very nice. The room is real private room with closing door. I recieved clean linen and blankets. Every morning we had good conversation of what is advised to do today.  
I can conclude my vןsit at Edward's house as very enjoyable and highly cost effective.[QWERTY123]na[QWERTY123]Edward was a great host and gave me terrific insights into New Yorkers life and where to go.  Thanks[QWERTY123]This is a really quiet and comfortable room to return to after exploring New York. It's surrounded by great places to eat and easy to get to. I found it really easy to get around the city from here. 

Most importantly, Edward is a great host! I would've been really lost without his endless advice and recommendations for food, cool stuff to see, how to group attractions and so on. I loved my stay here.[QWERTY123]Edward is a considerate and friendly host.  Its budget, basic accommodation.[QWERTY123]Great value for money: perfect location to explore Manhattan and  great host![QWERTY123]Excelente ubicacion y magnifica atencion por parte del anfitrion, siempre atento y dispuesto a aconsejar con su gran conocimiento de la ciudad.[QWERTY123]bon hôte qui partage son amour pour Manhattan. et present pour echanger et aider[QWERTY123]Le grand atout de ce logement est sa situation dans l'East Village et son calme. Il est facile de découvrir ce quartier à pied à partir de cet appartement, y compris en allant vers le West Village ou Chinatown. Nombreuses lignes de bus et de métro à proximité. Les conseils d'Edward sont excellents : il connaît tellement bien New York et aime profondément cette ville.[QWERTY123]Very friendly and is willing to give his knowledge of the city. Great place to stay and he cares about his guest.[QWERTY123]Edward was very nice and accomadating. I loved his stories and his caring nature. He seemed to truly care about my wellbeing and my situation. I am a woman travelling alone to a new place so I was a little scared but Edward made me feel safe. His little dog Lilly stole a huge part of my heart. So much so I wanted to take her home..haha. He really cares about animals and it shows. House is simple and small but room is fair size. The only thing that made me slightly uncomfortable was that if I had to go to bathroom during night I had to walk by his bed and it only made me uncomfortable cause I felt really bad bad for waking him. Although we were in close quarters, he made me feel welcome. I would definately stay with Edward again should I head back to New York. The apartment is a classic tenement building, or close to that era so you can feel the history as you walk in. If you are.looking for a 5 star this is not the place. But if you want to see real New York, you won't be disapointed. Thank you Edward :) till we meet again.[QWERTY123]Edward est un hote parfait, qui connait parfaitement NYC et donne de tres bons conseils. Il était très arrangeant. L'appartement est idealement situé pour visiter Manhattan et Brooklyn. Excellent rapport qualité prix.[QWERTY123]Airbnb as it used to be when it started out! You're not going to be staying at a hotel or some self catered facility, you're going to be staying with someone who has known NYC like the back of his hand for decades. Edward has seen his neighbourhood and the city at large change over the years. He's an incredibly articulate and interesting person and you will find yourself talking to him for hours about the city, politics, art, anything! I've been to NYC on dozens of different occasions, often for more than a week, but I still managed to appreciate his suggestions, that ranged from street food carts to the current exhibitions in town. Regarding the apartment, there is only one rule in NYC: location, location, location. You can't really go wrong with this. While the apartment itself is not big (what do you expect from NYC?!) your room will be fairly large. Oh, and the value is amazing![QWERTY123]This place is at a great location, there are many famous New York restaurants around it and on top of that Edward is a great help if you are new to the city. The apartment is quite and comforting and Edward is very easy going. He helped me a lot with so many tips and bits. Great place to stay![QWERTY123]Appartement idéalement situé dans east village, quartier à l'atmosphère typique, à 5 min du métro. Edward est un hôte pret à vous aider pour découvrir new'york hors des sentiers battus.[QWERTY123]The location of this apartment is in the east village with close by subway station. It is fantastic to explore Manhattan but also Brooklyn and Williamsburg since it’s in the south. The accommodation is very simple and basic. Edward is a friendly host who has a helpful knowledge about the city and is a great advisor also for the non tourist spots in Manhattan.[QWERTY123]If you come to Edward you get a guide and a friend, not just a room and a bed. He is a great guide. The price is amazing to have your own room in Manhattan. The place is someone's house, so don't expect it to be as neat as a hotel. Just be nice and you'll have a great time[QWERTY123]Edward is good host and knows the city in its details. He can provide you great advices for any trips.[QWERTY123]This a great place if you're on a budget. Perfect for the fast paced lifestyle of NYC. There a all kinds of trains nearby, food and drink galore, and a cool ""buzz"" in the neighborhood. The room provided is small, but a comfortable bed is a huge plus (with two fans!)

Edward is fantastic, lays down the house rules, and gives you great ideas on where to go for food, fun, and sightseeing. He's a long time New Yorker, and his help was priceless.[QWERTY123]The flat is really in a central position and well connected. Edward gave me a lot of precious advises and he was available all the time to help me. It's ideal for people that go to New York to visit it. I truly recommend the Edward's flat.[QWERTY123]Edward is very knowledgeable about NyC. He also give very good and practical traveling tips.[QWERTY123]何かﾆｭｰﾖｰｸで知りたいことがあれば､ｴﾄﾞﾜｰﾄﾞなんでも教えてくれます｡

He even let me check out later when he found out I had a late flight![QWERTY123]A very amenable and friendly host that allows you your own space. Great for tips and suggestions with the honesty of a native.  Engaged in many an interesting  chat and he's an articulate and receptive guy.  A great stay during a heatwave.[QWERTY123]I had a great stay in NYC as the location of the apartment is perfect to discover Manhatten and the other boroughs. Edward is a very kind host and provides tips for any kind of activity you may want to do and thereby helps to find and realize the things that will make your personal trip perfect.[QWERTY123]Edward’s airbnb was awesome. Edward is incredibly nice, making sure I had a wonderful stay. He is also incredibly knowledgeable of the city. The location and value are also amazing, you’re in the middle of everything![QWERTY123]Great[QWERTY123]Edward is a great guy! Very welcoming and always ready to give you very good advices !

It was a good time!  Thank you so much to Edward![QWERTY123]Edward is a very kind and helpful host. He is very available to communicate with his guests and can provide great tips about places to visit in NY

The position of the house is very confortable to visit NY, different subways' lines are at close reach

The house is the perfect solution for whom needs a place to sleep and take a shower while visiting the City

Would come back again![QWERTY123]Edward is a friendly host. He's got a huge knowledge of the city and he can give you useful tips and interesting chat. The room is big enough, with a double bed and priceless fans in summertime.  The location is great, in the East Village, an exciting neighbourhood, and close to subway and bus lines which take you to any part of the city.

56	8110	"Our family of 5 (three nine year old children plus mum and dad) from the UK stayed at Ctybegood for a week over New Year.  We had a great time and feel very fortunate to have found such a lovely place.  The Citybegood house is an original brownstone with a bohemian vibe. Lisel et al are great people, with inspiring community values who really welcomed us and were always attentive and interested in our needs while respecting our space.
The Slope area in Brooklyn is a fantastic, thriving and buzzy place. There’s a great place for coffee as well as restaurants, and a large grocery store just at the bottom of the road, literally seconds away. 
The Subway is less than 5 minutes away and it only takes 10 minutes to Manhattan. 
We all had a great time with music and dance at Brooklyn museum, which has a free open evening the first Saturday of the month. If you’re more interested in community values rather than posh hotels then this is for you. 
[QWERTY123]Great location in the heart of Park Slope !  Very easy to check in and check out.  We would stay here again.[QWERTY123]I felt at home. The rooms are comfortable and Lisel extremely welcoming. The area is beautiful, surrounded by nice restaurants, coffee places, and very close to all subways that can take you into the city in a matter of minutes. Lisel is very involved in social movements, which is inspiring and makes your stay with her so much more meaningful.[QWERTY123]Lisel is very accommodating and very prompt to answer any questions - fast response to my emails. The brownstone is in a beautiful area of Park Slope with easy access to subways and shops.  We came and went with ease.  Thank you, Lisel![QWERTY123]Absolutely wonderful! It was such a joy to spend the weekend here.  It's a unique and comfy space, a large rambling house with an enormous back yard, but Lisel's hospitality is what makes this so special. I don't think I've ever felt so at home while traveling.
[QWERTY123]My husband and I had a very nice stay at Lisel's Cbg Guest House.  Our taxi cab was just taking off when I heard somebody saying, ""Bienvenidos!""  Lisel was waiting for us at the doorsteps, which made me feel at home immediately.  Cbg #2 room was clean and comfy and eclectically decorated.  She placed an additional sofa for our visitor daughters and asked me to choose a throw from her Guatemalan blankets.  We could use the kitchen freely and visitors are welcomed.  If you like to do yoga, there is a by donation place 2.5 blocks from the Guest House, and lots of places to eat or to have a cup of coffee. I heard from a couple of people that the best coffee in the neighborhood happens to be a few steps from Cbg. She is surrounded by nice & helpful people (Seija, Tasha, Cecilio, Martha, & Cheryl) We would go back to this place without hesitation.  Lisel: You were gone when we left, but thank you much  for your hospitality!  Jesus & Rosalba[QWERTY123]CBg Guest House was a great find. Lisel's terrific: kind, welcoming, curious about her guests but not intrusive, and ready with good advice about where to get good local coffee etc. She and the house are both very hospitable. The home and garden are relaxed, lived-in-but-clean, comfortable spaces. It's not for someone looking for a hotel-ish experience; more like staying with a really lovely friend-of-a-friend. Transportation to Manhattan is also a breeze, with a number of subway lines an easy walk away. I'll stay here again![QWERTY123]I stayed in the front room on the middle floor @ CBG. Slept like a baby in the most comfortable bed ever. The room was comfy & warm. The other room on that floor doesn't have a window, which would be a drag. Didn't see the downstairs rooms, but the German couple who was staying there seemed happy. The bathroom on the 2nd floor is tiny & the shower is in the living room (very odd), but the other bathroom on the 1st floor is lovely and big (with an accessible shower if you need it). Nice big kitchen if you want to cook for yourself or hang out with the other guests. The location was absolutely perfect for me - I don't really know anything about NYC and was a little nervous about walking around alone at night in Brooklyn. Park Slope is sort of upper middle class hipster chic - lots of indie bakeries, coffee shops & boutiques. Strollers everywhere. You're in between 3 or 4 subway stations & a short walk from the LIRR from JFK. Couldn't be more convenient. There's a grocery store across the street & a Target a couple of blocks away if you forgot anything. Lisel is super nice, though we only met once. Only thing odd is that it's kind of like staying in your aunt's spare room, but you have to pay her $130 - that's what AirBNB is for, though. For me it was definitely worth it as a single woman who wanted safety & convenience. If you're more familiar with Brooklyn or traveling in a group you could probably stay in a dodgier neighborhood cheaper. Still cheaper than any hotel you'll ever find. Highly recommended. Thanks, Lisel![QWERTY123]Cbg Guest House is very warm, serene abode. Its location is ideal: it gives one immediate access to 5th Avenue's section Union-Street-to-15th-Street-and-above area. At the same time, it gives one access to the Vanderbilt, Atlantic, etc., Avenues' universe. Even more important, it is just a couple blocks from Prospect Park. What's not to like. Quality eating places and specialty-coffee store abound. So do the subway stops. Lisel is an extraordinarily welcoming, laid-back yet thorough, alert landlady. Every single aspect of my experience has been perfect. Highly recommended.[QWERTY123]CBG was a lovely place to stay - as others have said, it's a home away from home. I recently travelled alone from Australia to NY and of the three places I stayed during my trip this was definitely the best. Lisel allowed me to book a room at CBG on short notice and was very welcoming. I didn't see much of her as I was not there for long and she had her own business to attend to, however, from the conversations we had, I found her to be an interesting and friendly person. The house itself is really cute and full of colourful, hippy charm. There is a gorgeous garden out back, big kitchen, great shower, comfortable rooms, lots of paintings, mosaics and books. I stayed in the front room (downstairs) and although I was only there one night it was the little sanctuary I needed after such a long and stressful trip getting to NY. I was able to come and go as I pleased without infringing upon anyone (I spent the night out with friends and returned quietly and easily at 4am through the lower level entrance right next to my room). Lisel allowed me to stay late into the following afternoon so I could wait for a friend to come meet me. The bed was comfortable and Lisel provided both towels and toiletries. The area itself, Park Slope, is a beautiful part of Brooklyn - I wish I could've stayed longer to explore it more. For anyone who is unsure of where to stay in Brooklyn due to safety or cost, this place is definitely value for money and it is located in one of the nicest and safest areas of Brooklyn. The subway station is 2 mins up the road. I went walking here alone both during the day and night (4am from main st back to CBG) and found it to be a very quiet, safe and interesting area. There are plenty of shops, places to eat, friendly people, beautiful Brownstones, trees and birds. All in all a great place to stay, I highly recommend CBG and I will hopefully be back next time I come to NY.[QWERTY123]A great homely address ! We were a real tribe, coming from France with four adults et five children, and everybody found his place in this great and friendly house. 
Lisel is a very kind host, ready to give you some advice for your visit. And the location in Brooklyn, with the wild little garden, is perfect to rest after long walks in Manhattan. 
We hope to come again. Cecile & co.[QWERTY123]The CBG is a very homely, clean and comfortable place that is located not too far from Manhattan (took us about 20 minutes to get where we needed to be when we stayed there). Lisel was kind enough to help us when we needed a place to stay. Unfortunately Lisel was away, so we met by Roman who was friendly and very accommodating.

The big disappointment (aside from not being able to stay longer) was not getting a chance to meet Lisel as she has quite an eclectic library.[QWERTY123]Really enjoyed the stay. Great location, kind hospitality. Thanks![QWERTY123]Great location to everything I needed to get to. My stay was nice.[QWERTY123]A nice, homey, and affordable place to stay in NY![QWERTY123]Really great location close to great places to eat of all variety and loads of shops including a supermarket.
Has everything you'll need and not just the owner is there to help you out, but her help too.
[QWERTY123]This is a great place to stay, very big, quiet and friendly. The area is great with many shops and restaurants and 2 subway stations very close. Lisel wa very kind and helpful, I've already recommended the place to everyone I know![QWERTY123]We were lucky to find a place to stay so close to our daughter in Brooklyn.  It was really fun to actually see the inside of a brownstone!  We don't have such things in Texas.  Our bed was comfortable and the water was hot in the shower.  What more could we ask for?[QWERTY123]Had a very nice stay at the Cbg Guest House.  It is very comfortable and so conveniently located.  Accomodated my family of 4 perfectly for a one-night trip to Brooklyn.  Hope to stay their again soon.[QWERTY123]Our host was extremely nice and the location could not have been better, just off of 5th Avenue in Park Slope and within easy access of the 1/9 
trains and easy walking distance of the Atlantic/Pacific hub. And 5th Avenue is the place to be in Park Slope with all the best restaurants and nightlife. The Key Food just down the street is a great resource that you can use if planning to cook in the well-stocked kitchen. We were in town 
for a wedding and my mother-in-law had some issues with the place she had been supposed to stay, and Lisel was extremely helpful in our efforts to find a place for my mother-in-law (the mother of the bride, in fact)--and in the end, my mother-in-law stayed here, too. CBG is a little unconventional in their approach--as Lisel put it ""we're a little quirky, but if you like quirky we a great place to stay."" I like quirky and we had 
a great experience. On top of that, the CBG mission (helping those in need in Haiti) is admirable and I am glad that some of the money I paid is going to that cause. I would certainly stay here again.[QWERTY123]Just the perfect place to experience Brooklyn (and I guess, if you can make the time, Manhattan ;) It's a cozy, charming and homey place to stay. Warm, considerate hosts. I highly recommend. I'm so glad I found them![QWERTY123]Extremely friendly, welcoming and accommodating.  Interesting folks and a great cause.  I'll definitely stay again.[QWERTY123]We enjoyed our stay very much.  We were due in NYC in just a couple of days, and had experienced a cancellation from another host,  so we were very grateful for Cbg being available and helpful at the last minute. Lisel was very friendly and I greatly appreciate her involvement with helping the poor in Haiti.  Her fascinating and eclectic home was welcoming almost to a fault - I felt a bit like I was intruding in her personal space.  We were just there to sleep and bathe, so we didn't use the kitchen or backyard garden, but they were lovely as well.[QWERTY123]Lisel is the most amazing hostess. She stocks her home with everything you could possibly need, and made my stay very easy and enjoyable. Park Slope is a lot of fun. There are more people smiling in Park Slope than there are people smiling in the whole of Manhattan. 
All the best
Steven
[QWERTY123]My parents seemed to like the space. There was an issue with the heat but it was resolved. I'd recommend the space.[QWERTY123]This was the 2nd week that my parents stayed with cbg and, according to them, the stay this week was more exciting than the last and the room availability was astounding. Also, Lisel gave them the same discount to her price this week as the one last week and we're forever grateful to her for that. Her communication with me continues to be stellar. Lisel's a great host to my  parents.[QWERTY123]My friend and I enjoyed a fabulous four nights at Community Be Good and felt right at home. Lisel is a warm and caring woman who is most welcoming. We were unprepared for the sudden heatwave, but the next day a window air-conditioner had been installed. We loved meeting the other guests, especially the families. Loved the garden and the hammocks. The neighbourhood is vibrant with so many excellent places to eat. It was an oasis to return home to after the mayhem of Manhattan. We enjoyed exploring Brooklyn. The Museum was wonderful as was our visit to the Wyckoff Farmhouse. Loved chatting with Lisel. I'll return again for sure! Thank-you for making us feel so at homel![QWERTY123]We enjoyed our visit here. We had a fairly large private room with a double bed,  an air conditioner, ceiling fan and couch. The room was clean and comfortable and it was only a couple blocks away from our daughter. The convenient location was the primary factor in making our determination to stay here, but the friendly atmosphere and comfortable room made it a very nice stay.[QWERTY123]We stayed with Lisel for a little over a month while looking for a permanent place to live in Brooklyn. If you are staying more than a few nights, expect to become part of the household. The front room is large, and you will have your privacy whenever you wish. Lisel is a fascinating woman, and does some amazing charitable and community work both in NY and Haiti. If you desire, you'll have the chance for some interesting conversation or to read something from the formidable collection of books in the house.

CBG feels more like an eclectic share house than a guest house, which was great for us, but may not suit everyone. As part of a household, you might need to be flexible. Lisel asked me to move rooms for a few nights around July 4th so she could accommodate a family who had nowhere else to stay. Sure, that might be a tad inconvenient, but as I found out later, I was actually moving to Lisel's own room while she slept on a cot in the basement in order to accommodate everyone who needed a place to stay. If you think that was a pretty awesome thing for somebody to do, then this is the place for you. For people with the right mindset, CBG is highly recommended.[QWERTY123]Lisel is an excellent host, and Community Be Good is a friendly, safe, clean place to stay. There's a community fridge and kitchen, as well as easy access to the subway. For the NYC area, the place is fairly quiet inside and out. This place is for open-hearted travelers .[QWERTY123]The stay was great. SO happy to have found such a host in the same neighborhood of the venue the band was performing. Lisel was a great and welcoming host.[QWERTY123]My wife and I stayed at Communitybegood for the month of May whilst we renovated our apartment. Lisel is a warm generous host. The house is relaxed and welcoming and very comfortable. It is in a great location close to the park and an easy commute to the city.
We had a great stay.[QWERTY123]My husbsnd and I had a wonderful stay at Lisel's. Great atmosphere and fabulous location. Lots of common space to spread out and enjoy when not sight seeing.[QWERTY123]The place was sooo nice! The nice brownstone with the nice colorful entry and stairs welcomes its guests from the very first moment. You feel that it's home and that a colorful, traveling, open and social person (Lisel) lives over there. You feel like part of the house and of the area when you stay there for some days. It's very centered and at the same time in one of the nices streets in Brooklyn, Park Slope. There are other nice houses around it and nice people on the street, and trees and it's nice and calm but not lonely as there are the people on the street who live there all some time. Just around the corner there is a great coffee (Gorilla Coffee) great small shops for food, fresh fruits, clothes, cute - cosy - lively - comfortable pubs, bars and cafes just 2 minutes away in 5th Street with great food, music etc. All what you need is there. You can reach the subway by foot in 5-10 minutes in all directions. In a few minutes you are directly in Manhattan or in some more minutes in other parts of New York or down at the beach. :-)
A great place to stay... the house itsself as well locationwise the surroundings. The room was cozy and the bed comfortable and colorful :-) Lisel was really nice to meet and talk too! We would really recommend her great house! Plus the social issue behind it, which every person automatically donates for through paying the room :-) Thank  you Lisel and New York for welcoming us and letting us have such a great time![QWERTY123]Felt instantly welcome and at-home here. Lovely location, wonderful owners, and a great feel overall![QWERTY123]Had a good few days here. After a dull few days in a chain hotel nearby, I was glad of the colour, character, perhaps a little chaos, of CommunityBeGood. Loses lovely and helpful. Location convenient for Park Slope, and close to metro into Manhattan.[QWERTY123]The hostess greeted me at the front door at the time I said I would come and made me feel welcome.  The neighborhood was perfect and the artwork in her home lovely.[QWERTY123]Highly recommended for anyone who is looking for a safe, clean and convenient place to stay in Brooklyn. The host is kind, considerate and generous. She is using her own house to do the Airbnb housing as a charitable fund-raising project for people in Haiti. In one word, if you want to have a wonderful stay and do some good deeds at the same time, just contact the host!!![QWERTY123]I had a wonderful experience at this B & B.  My room was very clean and comfortable.  I appreciated the shared facilities: large, comfortable kitchen, dining room and garden seating in the yard.  The shower was large and clean.  Host Lisel was conscientious, knowledgeable, hospitable, thorough and interesting.  Her recommendations for neighborhood restaurants were helpful and on track for my interests.  I enjoyed chatting with her about her involvements in community and social action.  
This was my first air bnb experience.  I usually stay in corporate hotels  when I travel for business, but this time I wanted to get a sense of the Brooklyn neighborhood - Mission accomplished.  The air bnb listing was accurate describing the facility and room.  Also, staying here, I was more able to connect with the community.  And it's true, and important, that part of the fee for your room goes as a contribution to a charity that supports redevelopment in Haiti.  
So an excellent experience overall.  I'll return to this place and am encouraged to try other air bnb listings.[QWERTY123]this was my first Airbnb home stay, & initially I had some trepidation, until I spoke with Lisel on the phone..I was put @ ease, & from the moment of my arrival @ CommunityBeGood I felt @ home...Lisel welcomed me & familiarised me with the home...such a lovely home, I was blessed with the master bedroom; wonderful space & beautiful sense of cleanliness & Presence throughout the whole home, gorgeous community of guests--made new connections, home is conveniently located in what I consider to be one of the best areas of Brooklyn; great atmosphere & some of the best quality food in NYC...a home away from home for me, I had no desire to leave, & would love to return...a wonderful beginning to my Airbnb experience, thank you ever so much Lisel & guests...xOx[QWERTY123]Lisel was very hospitable. On arriving we got a tour of the place and helped us get comfortable. She gave us the keys and also a general information about the area. There were plenty of sheets, towels and other things for immediate use. We also had some interaction with guests from different parts of the world visiting NY including activists and artists. The place was clean and very close to busy Ave., where we were able to find lots of restaurants and bars. The proximity to prospect park was a great plus too.[QWERTY123]Lisel is a pretty nice host and the location is super good. It's near two metro stations with all the lines you need to get to any places in Manhattan. The 5th ave nearby has so many good restaurants. You don't have a private bathroom. The shared bathrooms are clean but shampoos and body washes are almost running out. The sofa bed is more comfortable than i thought, which is good. The real bed is small and can only fit one person.[QWERTY123]I'm one that is easily satisfied as long as my accommodations are clean. Unfortunately, this was not the case here. I couldn't believe the condition of the bedding. I had to find clean bedding in the bathroom and change it myself.[QWERTY123]Lisel is fantastic and went above and beyond to be an amazing host![QWERTY123]Lisel is an amazing person who has a global mindset! We loved staying at her place. Amazing neighbourhood and very comfortable place. Very clean and relaxed house. Lisel was so flexible with the details of our stay, such as check in and check out. Highly recommended![QWERTY123]Lisel is an awesome host. Her home is wonderful! We loved staying with her. The neighborhood is safe and family friendly. Lisel gives so much back to her community. It was a pleasure to meet and get to know her. She is a remarkable soul. This trip has been amazing and we look forward to the next time we can stay here. 
Thank you so much!![QWERTY123]Just as described, it was a cozy room in a fantastic location. Lisel and the other guests/habitants were all lovely, it was nice and quiet all the time. The location is great, lots of places to eat, hang out and explore nearby. We will be back again![QWERTY123]We have chosen Lisel's place for our short NYC Thanksgiving escape. Our main consideration was Park Slope, but the social impact story behind the place also sounded attractive. It all ended as ambient and atmospheric experience in a very special home where we finally spent around 2 hours just talking to the host and sharing a Thanksgiving dinner. What I did not expect of what looked like an informal guesthouse, was a feel of ultimate home-like comfort. We even had a bathrobe! Little elements of style, paintings, books, decorations, toys for our daughter... this is why we choose airbnb when we travel! And the charity thing behind it all just adds the flavor! We will be happy to come back.[QWERTY123]We felt home the minute that we had stepped through the front gates! The Brownstone is in a great neighborhood! I felt as if she was ""my favorite aunt"" that I was coming to visit, as Lisel makes the space truly feel like home.....

 It is warm and filled with with bright colors, beautiful artwork and positive energy. Diversity, equality, and empowerment is supported!  She is an avid recycler as we are which is awesome to see! There were ""guest"" shelves with snacks/food items  that we could have.

There amazing bookshelves line the walls in many different spaces, and the multitude of spiritual, personal growth, self-help, daily-meditations etc.  
I am excited to book again, and plan on doing so soon! ☮️❤️[QWERTY123]We had a good time: comfortable room, clean bathroom and kitchen, easy conversation with Lisel & other guests. A great option in the great neighborhood.[QWERTY123]From the moment we stepped foot into this amazing brownstone, Lisel made us feel right at home. The room was large and super comfortable. The outside temps may have been freezing, but we were cozy and warm in our peaceful surroundings. Lisel’s home is quiet, yet it is vibrant and full of life. Lisel goes out of her way to make sure her guests are familiarized with the ins and outs of the house, and that they feel comfortable accessing all there is to offer. She is very knowledgeable about the neighborhood as well as local  sites and transportation options. This home is run from the heart, and you feel the love when you are there.[QWERTY123]Lisel's place was great.  Rm 2 is a nice bedroom (1 bed and a pull-out coach).  We especially enjoyed the backyard space where you can sit-out and relax.  The location is also great - close to the metro and prospect park with a lot of great restaurants near by.[QWERTY123]Thank you for being such a great host, Lisel![QWERTY123]Nice place![QWERTY123]Nice quiet place near the Barclay stadium
Walking distance to the stadium and good food. Right next to a metro station so it's in a prime location to travel anywhere.[QWERTY123]Lisel is very warm and welcoming, and the location is great. Unfortunately I was not aware that this is a hostel with many guests, as opposed to a single family home with one or two rooms rented out. In light of that, it didn’t work for my needs, however Lisel very understanding and helpful in the cancellation process.[QWERTY123]Lisel is an enthusiastic and helpfulness hostess who is also very passionate about her help with the Haiti fund. She gave us lots of information and printed our tickets for a festival! Would definitely stay again, the neighbourhood is great! Thanks[QWERTY123]Lisel and Rita are lovely hosts, it was great to meet and listen to them. The room is clean and comfortable. Location is good to live the heart of Brooklyn and is very close to a staple like prospect park and to everything you need, like restaurants or shops; furthermore, it is a few minutes walk to the subway. Thanks![QWERTY123]Lisel’s place is in a GREAT location. Can’t be beat. Her home has a very lived-in feel, and staying there reminded me of hostels I stayed in during various travels abroad. This place has everything you need, but isn’t luxurious or overly comfortable. I was grateful for the TV and air conditioning unit and got good use out of both. When I first arrived the lock on the bedroom door was broken and the door didn’t completely close, but it was fixed a few days later. Lisel seems very warm and checked in on me a few times.[QWERTY123]This place is full of character a lot of art in the walls and a great supermarket just around the corner super convenient but the best part was interacting with all the other guests, all amazing people Lisels friends included! I would totally stay there again, in fact I probably will. Highly recommend it because it’s also super affordable.[QWERTY123]This is a great location for Brooklyn or even to take the subway to Manhatten. I didn't stay long enough to develop opinions about the place,but enjoyed my brief time there.[QWERTY123]La casa si trova in una posizione ottima di Brooklyn ed è a 5 minuti a piedi dalla fermata metro, che corrisponde ad palazzetto dello sport sempre molto frequentato. Davvero una bella casa[QWERTY123]This house is a great spot if you want to explore Brooklyn or any part of New York. Friendly hosts and everything we expected was met. Would stay again!"	40.68000629178835	-73.97864508221993	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/8110	3	120.0	0.833333
57	20300	"Staying at Pas's was an amazing experience! The room was spacious, his roommate was delightful and the location is perfect! We would highly recommend him! Thanks Pas!! :)[QWERTY123]As wonderful as the location was, we were extremely disappointed with the whole experience. From the beginning when I requested the reservation, I told Pas of our whole plan. We were taking the train in from CT and had an afternoon show, but we had bags we wanted to drop off beforehand. Pas explained to me that he would be out of town, but that his roommate Melanie would be there to let us in. After a ton of text messages back and forth with Melanie (2 hours before our arrival), she informed me that she would leave the apartment door open but we would have to get someone to let us into the building. This was not a good start to our stay. 

As soon as we got into the [fairly] clean room, my fiancé saw a huge stain on the comforter so he pulled it back, only to see crumbs on the sheets. We immediately called Melanie and kindly asked her to change our sheets out for clean ones; she assured us that she would. 

When we arrived back around midnight, we checked the sheets and it was obvious they were not cleaned. At the very most, they were thrown into a dryer to give off a clean smell. I went into the bathroom to wash my face and brush my teeth, and had to dry everything off with toilet paper. I do not expect to be provided any toiletries (although every Air BNB I have stayed at has), but at the very least a clean hand towel would have been nice! At that point, it was almost 12:30 am and we had a very long day, so we decided to just stick it out, even though we were ready to leave. 

Finally, the both of us were woken up by the dog barking at 2 am when one of the roommates got home. Not only that, but we could hear 2 people talking for about an hour until we finally fell asleep again. It's unfortunate to say, but we could not wait to get out of there in the morning."	40.7291197638643	-73.98057094180119	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/20300	2	50.0	0.8
58	20611	"I stayed in Lulu's place for one week with my girlfriend and I cannot fault it in any way. The location is perfect, in a great part of Brooklyn and close to the subway for access to the rest of the city. The apartment was spotless and decorated in a cool, modern style. As well as all that, Lulu is a friendly, funny and attentive host. I hope to stay again some day.[QWERTY123]First of all, Lulu is a great lady as a host. She is so nice and friendly and organized her place for guest so well. When I went to get key for my friend, I thought I made right choice. Thank you Lulu, My friend was really happy and appreciate your hospitality. She wished she could speak English more. 
I highly recommend if someone visit NY and want to stay nice and great price!!![QWERTY123]My daughter and I stayed at Lulu,s place and we just loved it, great appartment, great location, love Williamsburg....but most off all loved Lulu...great host, warm, kind and friendly.
Thanks for having us Lu.....totaly gonna miss our conversations...xoxo 
Sandra & Stacey[QWERTY123]My boyfriend and I stayed at Lulus apartment for a week. It was perfect! Lulu is an amazing person with a great sense of humour. Her place is organized, clean, nicel decorated and in a wonderful location. It was our first time in New York and Lulu couldn't have been more helpful. What ever you do don't miss the opportunity to get to know this wonderful lady, her apartment and Williamsburg![QWERTY123]Great location, and the friendliest host. Loved our stay at Lulu's.[QWERTY123]Even though we only stayed for 4 nights we really felt like we lived there. The apartment was so homely, cared for and comfortable; Williamsburg had an awesome neighbourhood vibe and Lulu was an amazing host. Five stars aren't enough.[QWERTY123]Lulu's flat is just perfect, super clean, very well organised and decorated. Located in a great neighbourhood with lots of nice bars, restaurants and shops. And most important Lulu is such a great host, very sweet and full of good advice. We had a wonderfull time and we'll surely stay at her place next time we'll go to NY.[QWERTY123]Lulu is the consummate hostess!  Great neighborhood with easy access to transit and a respite from the city (yet still super close).  Would highly recommend to friends and family![QWERTY123]Lovely room in a cute little apartment. Excellent host, and fabulous location - so close to lots of great bars and restaurants in williamsburg![QWERTY123]The apartment is well situated, being just a few yards from Bedford Avenue and all it has to offer, and a 5 minute walk to a couple of subways that will take you straight to Manhattan in a matter of minutes. A spotlessly clean and tidy apartment, with some interesting books and other literature around that could enhance your visit. We had the larger of the two rooms and slept like proverbial logs, on a very comfortable bed. 
Lulu was an excellent host and helpful with ideas and suggestions when needed, so we have no hesitation in recommending the apartment to other visitors.[QWERTY123]The flat is one cozy, clean and beatyful place in the best neighborhood in Brooklyn! Ginger was the perfect host! Thank you very much for everything :-)[QWERTY123]My fiance and I had an AMAZING time staying at Lulu & Ginger's apartment in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. The apartment was beautiful, clean and close to a ton of incredible cafes, thrift stores, bars, and two metro stops. I highly, highly recommend Lulu & Ginger as AirBnB hostesses! You won't find a more kind accomodating pair! 5 stars, absolutely![QWERTY123]My girlfriend and I spend 3 nights in Lulu & Ginger's apartment. We were initially supposed to stay one more night, but our flight from Vegas to New York was cancelled because of the snow storm in NYC. I sent and email to Lulu and she was very understanding, accepting the reservation change of one day although she did not have to. Thank you again for that! The apartment itself was clean and cozy. Ginger took care of us, she was very quiet and always willing to help for our walks or visits. For the breakfast there were tee, milk, coffee and some bagels with butter. About the bedroom, the mattress was good but we could ear some noise from the street during the night. Maybe it's because we are used to live in the country but taxi drivers honk a lot in NYC! The bathroom is tiny but never ran out of hot water! Finally, this bedroom has a good value, very affordable compared to the hotels in Manhattan and not too far. We did not spend much time in Brooklyn so I can't tell you about the district! It was nice meeting Ginger, we wish we could had stayed a little big longer![QWERTY123]We were at Ginger and Lulu's home for a few days.
 I was really fine. The home of Ginger and Lulu is tidy, very clean, convenient to downtown and is located in a wonderful neighborhood. Ginger was very welcoming and kind. He made us feel really at home.
 Too bad that the bathroom is so small and a bit uncomfortable but our stay was really great. I am pleased to be their guest. We also took advantage of yoga classes of Ginger. Excellent teacher!  Thanks! Daniele Salvo[QWERTY123]Our stay with Lulù and Ginger was wonderful! The apartment is just as pictured, cozy, warm and super tidy and clean! Our bedroom, the (beautiful) master bedroom, had a super comfortable bed, and we fell asleep instantly every night!
The apartment is conveniently located between subway stations, one stop from Manhattan, and in a really lively neighbourhood. 
We had the luck of meeting both Ginger and Lulù, who was in from Kenya, and we had the most pleasant talks, and they advised us to best restaurants, Viva la arepas! :-) 
They also have plenty of travelguides, booklets and maps to make sure you make the most out of your stay.
We really hope to see them again, for sure whenever we go back to New York! Thanks a lot!!
Gerard en Marleen[QWERTY123]This was my first time booking a room through airbnb.com, and I found say that it was a truly wonderful experience.  Lulu & Ginger were extremely prompt when it came to the booking process and they provided me with very detailed and clear instructions on how to get to their home and let ourselves in.  My friend and I met Ginger (Lulu was not home) shortly upon arrival and I must say that she was extremely accommodating and very sweet.  

Overall the apartment was clean, vibrantly decorated and home-y.
The room itself was cozy and comfortable.  A huge bonus was the memory foam mattress!  We were mostly out and about during our 3-night stay so we unfortunately  didn't take advantage of the kitchen or the nice coffee/tea station that they had set up.

The apartment is conveniently located a few short blocks away from a subway stop and there are a ton of great restaurants and bars within walking distance.  

I hope to stay here again soon someday  :)[QWERTY123]We've had a great time in NY! Our stay with Ginger in Lulu's apartment  has really made it very special. The apartment is lovely, clean and very comfortable plus Ginger is awesome and a welcoming host. We really fell on our feet :) We're looking forward to staying in the apartment on trip #2 to New York![QWERTY123]We had a  very lovely stay. The apartment was peaceful and the neighborhood felt safe. The location was great and it was easy to get around. Our host Ginger was very nice and helpful.[QWERTY123]Our stay with Lulu and Ginger was beyond perfect and completely surpassed our expectations!!! Their very quick and always helpful responses, warm hosting, lovely, clean and very charming apartment made our weekend in New York incredible and very special. This will be our number one choice when we plan our next weekend to New York without a doubt!![QWERTY123]Great apartment in a great location. We loved it. Thanks Ginger and Lulu.[QWERTY123]Very good location. Nice and quite apartement.[QWERTY123]Ginger's apartment in Brooklyn was amazing to say the least, an old style building with a modern interior. She was lovely and extremely helpful with any need we had during our stay. Williamsburg itself is a fantastic area with it's cafes and quirky stores. Would most definitely stay with Ginger again if ever in Brooklyn.[QWERTY123]Ginger is a sweet and helpful hostess!  Lulu has set up a great home (she was off in Kenya when we were there - but even through email Lulu was kind and helpful!)  
We stayed in the bigger room with AC.  
The apartment is beautifully decorated.  Mostly Quiet except sometimes there was loud music playing in other apartments with whom we shared the courtyard (but this never happened at night),  inside our bedroom was quiet!  
The neighbourhood is amazing!  Walking distance to bars, restaurants, cafes and subway!
I would absolutely stay with Ginger and Lulu again![QWERTY123]Lulu and Ginger have a beautiful apartment and they are very kind, gracious hosts. It was a great place to stay in New York. We had a fantastic time and hope to return again one day![QWERTY123]nice comfy old nyc appt , ginger was a nice polite freindly host , who gave you your own space and privacy , location was good 5 mins walk to marcy av subway which is one stop from manhatten on the j train, the area looked a little unsafe at first but was fine , plenty of cheap eats near the subway station , plenty of people around even after midnight walking about so felt safe ect , note tho the appt is on the 5th floor so unsuitable for unfit or lazy people, the room was big enough , had the room facing the street very little noise really was surprised , the double bed was excellent and very comfy , bathroom very small and old but hey its not a hotel ,  all in all great stay would reccomend nice to stay in the real new york at a good price ,[QWERTY123]The biggest room is really nice and confortable. The appartment is well placed and not far from 2 different metro lines. The kitchen is usefull. One thing that we didn't like : the bathroom is a little bit dilapidated and there is no washbasin so you have to brush your teeth is the  kitchen sink! Exept that it was a great time there ![QWERTY123]Lulu and Ginger's accommodation was perfect. It was in a great location with very quick access to Manhattan as well. The apartment and our bedroom were lovely. The bed was so comfy! Lulu and Ginger were lovely to stay with and made us feel really welcome and relaxed. They gave us great tips on where to go and explore. Lulu made us a delicious chocolate pudding as well while we were staying :)
The accommodation and hosting could not have been better, I highly recommend staying with Lulu and Ginger in Williamsburg.[QWERTY123]The perfect base for exploring New York or just hanging out in Williamsburg.[QWERTY123]We had a great time by Lulu& ginger, with nice tips to visit and eat ;)
[QWERTY123]The apartment is in a great location, their are good cafe's and fun stores nearby.   It was close to the subway, less then a 10 minute ride into the city.  Lulu and Ginger were great hosts, very accommodating of our late arrival time when we flew into NYC.[QWERTY123]Unfortunately the place was not what I had expected it to be. Yes, the room was nice (although very dusty) and I really don't mind brushing my teeth in the sink although I feel one should have the possibility to wash one's hands before one comes out of the bathroom. The reasons why I actually moved to some different accomodation was that I could not imagine to stay at a place where I cannot actually really use the toilet (it clogs so badly that one should actually not throw tolietpaper in there). Bedford Avenue is close and a nice street to stroll along but the house itself and especially the outside staircase is dilapidated and must have been neglected for a long time.[QWERTY123]The Cozy Bedroom in Williamsburg was very nice, clean and comfy. Constance was a very friendly host. We really liked to stay in williamsburg because there are so many cute little shops and restaurants. If we would go again to New York (and we will!) will we definitely try to book the room again![QWERTY123]Lulu's apartment is as it appears in the pictures -- a very warm and inviting place. The location was exactly what I was looking for -- a bit off the beaten path but situated close enough to the subway stations that I could get into Manhattan with ease. And Constance was a fine host. She was friendly, but also gave me and my traveling partner  space to do out own thing in the apartment. I especially appreciated Constance's help in guiding me to the apartment when i got lost on my way there. The only downside to the stay was the bathroom. As others have said, it is small and quite worn. The bathroom door doesn't lock and any toilet paper you use cannot be flushed away but needs to be thrown in the trash can. That said, Constance did a great job keeping the place clean and I appreciated the fact that we had the chance to stay in a real neighborhood, rather than a tourist area.
[QWERTY123]Wonderful place right in the heart of Williamsburg. Couldn't have been nicer.[QWERTY123]Hello All,
This was our second time staying at Lulu's home and it was exiting for us to stay there again. We know and love the neighbourhood and we felt right at home.
Lulu is a great host and her appartment is a very nice and warm place to stay.

Thanks so much for having us again Lulu....we love youuuuu!!!![QWERTY123]We had a great time staying at Lulu's place. Lulu is a great communicator and very accommodating. The apartment is in a fantastic location, Williamsburg has a lot going on, and it's only one stop on the subway to Manhattan, with easy connections to other lines. The airconditioning was a total saviour, and Constance was a fabulous host. Any inconveniences (no sink in toilet, can't flush toilet paper) have been covered in the description and so there were absolutely no nasty surprises for us, plus they were really not a big deal anyway. Highly recommend this place![QWERTY123]It was a great room and luckily had air conditioning. We had an awesome stay, everything worked out as planned. The room was clean, the kitchen well equipped. Only the bathroom is not so nice and very small, but we knew that before so no surprise here. All in all great stay![QWERTY123]I had a very pleasant stay in Lulu's apartment. It is wonderfully placed in Williamsburg close to lovely restaurants and bars and a short walk from the subway. The room was comfortable and larger than you are likely to get in Manhattan. As previous guests have said, the bathroom is a little small and the towel rail kept coming off the wall - but this really wasn't a problem for me. Lulu was a complete delight to deal with - very communicative and unfailingly helpful. Constance was very friendly too and made me feel at ease in the apartment.[QWERTY123]Lulu's place was perfect for us.  It was clean and ideally located in the heart of south Williamsburg.  Although there were multiple guests, we didn't hear a single peep from them and thus slept quite well.  Lulu and her host Constance were both very responsive and accommodating in terms of picking up and dropping off keys.  The only small disadvantage of this place is that it's on the fifth floor and there's no elevator, so pack light or beef up before you come.[QWERTY123]Because of Lulu, I will stay using AIRBNB forever! What a nice and warm host she is and the room was very fine. Couldn't be better.[QWERTY123]Lulu is a warm and friendly host with a well equippped, very well located apartment.  This colorful and clean apartment is full of indiosycrasies (including four flight walk up) which contribute to its charm.[QWERTY123]Lulu is very sweet and her place is cozy. She and her apartment have great energy. You could tell that she maintains the place and is concerned with her guests comfort. I didn't really stay at her apartment because I ended up staying with a friend that I ran into in New York but I would book Lulu's place again in a heartbeat. Speaking of heart beat...there are many many stairs but I guess that's New York.[QWERTY123]It's a tough one... The apartment in itself is really nice, it's in an old building in the heart of Williamsburg. It's well situated too, just a 5 mn walk from the metro, and then a 15 mn ride to Manhattan. And even though I only met Lulu very briefly, she seems like a very nice and friendly person. I had a really pleasant stay overall.

But, unfortunately, there's one downside : this place had roaches when I stayed there. Even though Lulu assured me it was because of recent construction works in the apartment below (and I totally believe her) I would advise travelers to exercise caution before renting there.[QWERTY123]Lulus place was just wonderful and made us feel at home in a great neighbourhood! Lulu is a great host and a extremely nice person.[QWERTY123]My sister and I really enjoyed our stay in this lovely apartment, and would definitely recommend it. The apartment is very tidy and well-looked after. The hosts were helpful and friendly. The location is great, a short walk to a range of fun eateries and a subway stop. Would most definitely stay here again![QWERTY123]Perfect location in Williamsburg. We stayed in the bigger room which was very good and it was nice and clean. The apartment was charming and had all the basics, it wasn't fancy and new, but it matched our expectations. Over all a really good experience.[QWERTY123]good location, cute apartment, constance and ronan took good care of us.  thanks for a nice stay![QWERTY123]We had a great time in NYC and in Lulu´s apartment.
It´s perfect located in Williamsburg near the subway. We stayed in the bigger room which was big enough, nice and clean. The apartment has everything we needed. Just the bathroom is very, very small and a little old.
If we will come back to New York again, we would really like to stay there a second time. Thank you very much, Lulu and Constance!!![QWERTY123]Nuestra estancia fue por 11 noches y pasamos unos días increibles, Constance y su esposo nos trataron como en casa.
El departamento es comodo, caliente durante el invierno y tiene todas las comodidades que requeriamos.
Recomiendo ampliamente su estancia, por supuesto regresaría.
Mil gracias por todo Lulú & Constance!!!![QWERTY123]Our stay at Lulus was very pleasant . The apartment  was warm & cosy which was just what we were looking for during a very cold time in New York .
 The people were friendly  & we would gladly recommend  the apartment for other travellers.

Thanks from Rod & Ben[QWERTY123]Very cozy, super warm, nice neighborhood, close to subway![QWERTY123]I personally would not recommend my stay at this location, largely due to my communications in dealing with the apartment owner.  That being said, many others seem to have had positive experiences.  Below are my pros and cons:

Pros:
* Decent location, not too far from public transport
* Apartment and room was tidy
* Live-in apartment managers were friendly and accommodating (helped take out our recycling after we flattened the boxes)

Cons:
* Very negative experience dealing with owner - particularly in regards to pre and post stay communications 
* Very noisy apartment/thin walls - offered little privacy
* Very sub-par bathroom facilities (rusty tub, no sink to brush teeth, etc in bathroom - had to do all washing up in kitchen sink)
* Have a washing machine, but no dryer - kind of defeats the purpose
* Very dirty common areas of the building and other people's comments regarding cockroaches and giant bottle of Raid in the apartment was unsettling

Lastly, if you are intending on booking the entire place, be very clear in your request.
[QWERTY123]It's my first time to visit New York and I have a great time to stay at Lulu's place for 7 days :) The location is very convenient close to subway line J,M,Z and nearby Bedford avenue where we enjoyed eating so much. There are many bakery shops and nice restaurants there. Ronan and Constance, the host are very friendly and helpful. I feel like home when I stay here ^____^[QWERTY123]We enjoyed a very clean and spacious room in a very nice neighborhood! Organisation and key pick up went perfectly smooth! will come again!!![QWERTY123]Communication with Lulu and Constance was very fast and pleasant. The location is perfect. Just two stops by train from Manhattan. Two subway stations nearby, Marcy & Bedford. Marcy if you prefer the shortest walk home, Bedford if you prefer a walk along hipster boutiques and cozy coffee bars. The apartment has all the basic things you need for your stay. The bright colors and decoration make it cozy.[QWERTY123]Good communication, vibrant Williamsburg neighbourhood, clean and lovely. We enjoyed our stay, thank you Lulu![QWERTY123]The apartment and the rooms were clean and neat. The other guests (two other couples) were friendly and never disturbed us. If you want to, it is easy to cook lunch/dinner and make breakfast in the kitchen (but there is also a really nice bagel place one block away... :)) All in all, the room we stayed in was big enough for two persons with quite a lot of luggage and I would gladly stay here again! We bought a metro card and it was easy to travel to Manhattan with the L train (and also with some other train from another station which I don't remember the name of)[QWERTY123]We really enjoyed staying in Lulu's flat! It's clean, cozy and colorful place. Only problem that we had was with towels. When we arrived, we didn't know which are ours and there were a few, still wet towels in living room. Otherwise, everything was ok. Location and neighborhood are great, just a few minutes interesting walk from L subway and there is a plenty things to do and experience in Williamsburg. We'll come back for sure...[QWERTY123]It is a really nice place for a stay in New York. It is clean and very good located. Altogether it was a really nice stay in New York and i will choose it again if i stay in New York.[QWERTY123]Lulu's apartment looks charming and cute and was in just the right neighborhood. It delivered on all counts, not to mention Lulu is AMAZING... wow what a powerhouse intelligent well-traveled woman. She's one-of-a-kind. So first, count yourself lucky Lulu is your host! Lots of attention to detail - from the welcome letter, towels, and tea/coffee bar she has, to her personal recommendations of where to eat and what to do. My only caveat is that we were carrying a lot of luggage/equipment this visit, and her 5-floor walk-up wiped us both out each time we came home at the end of the day. No elevator; pretty normal for NYC though. I didn't ask or warn her either and it definitely says 5-floor walkup in the description, so it's totally my bad. With no bags, it's totally doable. The apt was ultra-clean too by the way - and quiet, great street view, a few steps from Bedford ave and lots of great little places. Stay here! She's amazing, the place is amazing, you'll have a great time :)[QWERTY123]Lulu airbnb review
We're so glad we picked the Williamsburg Sweetie to stay in while we were in New York. First a couple of things about the room, flat and location. 
The room was larger than I expected with an air conditioner which was such a bonus considering how unseasonably hot it's been. 
The flat was gorgeous, well appointed and felt safe and secure. It also, awesomely, had a washing machine we were free to use (although we forgot about this, whoops). 
We were close to everything; Bedford Ave, the Williamsburg Bridge, Marcy Avenue station and the M line. Great views from the roof and great food everywhere! 

Now on to Lulu, we could not have asked for a better host! She was so friendly and made us feel really welcome. She had loads of useful recommendations for things to do, as well as great travelling tips for getting around. Thanks so much Lulu, it was a pleasure to stay with you! 
[QWERTY123]Stay with Lulu!!!  Her place is located in a perfect part of Williamsburg; close to two subway locations and perfectly placed next to Bedford Avenue, which is lined with the best boutiques, coffee shops and restaurants.  This is a great location to experience both the city and Brooklyn!  The apartment is warm and inviting.  The bedroom was clean, bed was comfortable and provided ample space for all of our shopping acquisitions.  Lulu was the best; attentive to our questions about the city, helpful with any household needs and none the less such a wonderful host!  We will be back to Brooklyn to stay here![QWERTY123]We spent two weeks in the biggest room of Lulus' apartment. 
The room is located on the 5th floor of a Brooklyn's traditional bulding of the twenties. 

Williasmburg is a great neighborhood, very pleasant to live in, and is full of local markets and shops. The transportation is very convenient: just few block from the house there are two Metro stations which lead to Midtown and Downton Manhattan in 15 minutes.

The apartment is very nice and clean. Lulù was a caring and discreet guest  always ready to give you advice (Thank you again :-).[QWERTY123]We had such a wonderful time at Lulu's Cozy Bedroom! Lulus wasn't there, when we arrived, but arranged everything very well, so we could easily come in her apartment. When we met her, we were so keen on her heartiness, her generosity and her humor: whenever she was there, we talked and laughed a lot and in this way Lulu made us feel home immediately. The Cozy Bedroom and the bathroom are small but have everything you need and it's clean everywhere. The location is almost perfect (the subway is close and you are in Manhattan in less than half an hour) and Williamsburg itself is an interesting, vivid district and worth visiting. We definitely recommend Lulu and her Cozy Bedroom to everyone who wants to stay at a great place in New York City.[QWERTY123]Nus avons passé une semaine chez LuLu. 
Appartement conforme à la description.
LuLu a été parfaite. Nous donnant de précieux conseils.
La chambre et la literie était top Cela peut devenir un petit peu bruyant mais sans conséquences fâcheuses.
C'est bien placé a un quart d'heure de deux lignes de metro.
idéal pour visitez NY et dormir dans un quartier super comme Williamsburg !
Je recommande ![QWERTY123]Everything was so perfect: the room, the all apartment, the neighborhood and...Lulu!!! She is so funny and kind with a very contagious laugh! If needed, she will be present and helpful for everything, info on the subway and the best ways to reach places you want to see, good suggestions on restaurants and brunch, lovely places to visit, nice things going on in the neighborhood. She makes you feel the Williamsburg mood and a Home atmosphere at the same time.
The room and the apartment are as you can see in the pictures, beautiful, cozy and clean with few but smart rules which make the cohabitation pleasant.
The neighborhood is great too with nice shops, good restaurants and mini market, bars and pubs...even a good tattoo studio around the corner if you need :D It's perfect for spending dinner time after the day walking in Manhattan. 
SUCH  A GREAT TIME AND GOOD VIBES THERE, I HOPE TO COME BACK SOON!!![QWERTY123]Our stay at Lulu's place was awesome !! The neighborhood is full of restaurants and bars, the appartement is so clean and Lulu is the nicest host we got. She is very organized. She lets your privacy but she always there if you need an advice for a place to eat or to go. She speaks english and spanish. What else ? I give her 5 stars and for sure, we will back at her place the next time we go to new york. Gracias por todo Lulu !![QWERTY123]Lulú's cozy apartment was even better than we expected! It was located in a good neighborhood just one subway stop away from Manhattan. There were nice restaurants in the area and we went to one of them recommended by Lulú. It was our first time both in New York and using Airbnb and thanks to this great experience we will surely come back. Could absolutely imagine staying at Lulu's place again!
Lulú is really friendly and helpful and made sure that we had everything ok. We didn't meet her but we kept in contact by email and everything went smoothly :)[QWERTY123]Lulu's place is the best!!  Great location right in the heart of Williamsburg, very close to Manhattan and I felt very safe in the neighborhood. 
The apartment is clean, cozy and has anything you might need... this Airbnb experience was just perfect. 
I've actually spent almost an entire month there, so I felt pretty much at home till I left this afternoon. I can't really image coming back to NYC and staying some place else. 
Lulu was an amazing host from the beginning, helping us with our questions, giving us tips and always responded swiftly. 
Cleuci, the apartment manager, was also great. From the moment I got there, she made me feel at home. 
I would definitely recommend the place... Unless you want to stay there at my next travel dates to NYC, then please get away from my room. lol :P
Thank you for everything, Lulu and Cleuci. You helped make this month an amazing one. :)[QWERTY123]Lulu's place made me feel home. It was my first experience with the Airbnb and I sure loved it. The place is small, but very cozy. The apartment had many magazines and books about NYC and it was very handy to help us plan what would be our plans for the next day.

Although it is not really a weak point for me, the apartment is on the fifth floor with no elevator, so be prepared to work out a little everyday, especially if you are coming home after a day shopping.

In the overall, I really enjoyed staying at Lulu's. The atmosphere was great, the other guests were very nice and we managed to have interesting discussions with them. It was a very pleasant first airbnb experience and I recommend the place to everybody.[QWERTY123]The price is reasonable and its convenient. It only cost 5 minutes walking to subway and only one stop to Manhattan.The room is clean and quiet.[QWERTY123]Lulu was a pleasure to deal with and although she was not in town at the time of my stay, she was super efficient at communicating. 

The apartment is located in a great spot! It is at the beginning of Bedford Ave; a nice street to walk, eat, shop and catch the subway. We also walked home from Manhattan over the Williamsburg Bridge.  

The apartment was as described; simple yet cosy. It was extremely clean!!! We stayed in the front guest room; the bed was comfortable (mattress was foam) and the shared bathroom includes a toilet and bath/shower (the basin is shared in the kitchen).

Overall a good experience and great value for money![QWERTY123]Lulu' place is a lovely old Brooklyn building. Her manager Claire lives on the property and does everything she can to help out. I didn't have internet for a day and she bent over backwards for hours on the phone to get it back online. If you're tall like I am the bathroom might be a little cramped for you, and the sink is in the kitchen, but I think most people under 6' should be fine. 
Plenty of heat in the cold NYC weather and the place was very homey. A great place to live if you don't mind a 5th floor walk up. 
Lulu is also very accessible through airbnb and gets back to you very quickly. Had a comfortable stay.[QWERTY123]Lulu is very organised and she made everything so clear before we came. The description was accurate and it looked similar to the pictures. We had lots of space to store our stuff. 
We liked the neighbourhood, lots of cool cafes, bars and shops and we went to a few of the places that Lulu suggested. We felt safe walking around at night and it wasn't hard to find the subway.

[QWERTY123]Lulu's place is lovely and very cosy. The room was clean, the bed comfortable and we didn't have anything to complain about. 
As others already wrote, the bathroom is very tiny, but even for us (we are both very tall) was it still ok to use. 
We had free coffee or tea and towels which was nice. 
Unfortunately we didn't meet Lulu in person, because she wasn't in the US during that time, but her apartment manager Claire took care of us. She was so nice and helpful with everything. She even took us out the first night for some drinks, which was very cool. 
The neighborhood is just perfect. You get very quickly to Manhattan but at the same time you live in a very hip area that offers  everything you need. Hip bars, cafes, shops, galleries and restaurants. 
We definitely enjoyed our stay at Lulu's place and we would recommend it for sure! 
And because there are two rooms, that can be booked with airbnb, you are able to meet other travellers and people from all around the world, which is awesome, too. 
Thank you for letting us feel so welcome. We will be coming back again when its warmer in NY :)[QWERTY123]Lulu et Claire (son apartment manager) se sont montrées très prévenantes et disponibles pour organiser notre arrivée à l’appartement et s’assurer que notre séjour se déroulait bien.

Le logement est tel que décrit dans l’annonce, très propre et fonctionnel. Pour ceux qui ont le sommeil sensible, la chambre donne sur la rue, mais cela n’est pas gênant avec une bonne paire de boule quies.

Comme indiqué dans d’autres commentaires, il n’y a pas de lavabo dans la salle de bain, mais cela n’est pas très gênant pour un séjour de quelques jours.

Le quartier est très sympa (beaucoup de restaurants, bars, …) et bien desservi par le métro qui permet de rejoindre facilement Manhattan.[QWERTY123]The house was really nice,everything was clean and tidy and the neighborhood is just amazing. Lulu wasn't there so Claire welcomed us and has been really helpful, we stayed there for 9 days and we enjoyed every moment.[QWERTY123]Es war sehr gemuetlich in Lulus Wohnung und wir haben uns sehr wohl gefuehlt. Eine ruhige Wohngegend und nah zur Subway, sind gute Voraussetzungen für einen Besuch in Big Apple.[QWERTY123]Our stay at Lulu's place was great! The room was cozy and comfortable and Jnah, the apartment manager was very welcoming. He took us out for drinks and showed us good places to eat. the location is great, next to Bedford av, which is files with nice restaurants and cafe's and close to the subway (L and M train stations nearby) Overall we had an amazing time in New York, and I would definitely return to Lulu's place![QWERTY123]Our stay was stress-free and hugely enjoyable, thanks to Lulu's attention to detail and her warm & exuberant spirit. We loved her clean, charming and authentic Brooklyn pad and our 3 nights were very comfortable. It was always fun to cross paths with Lulu as we all came & went, and share stories of our daily travels. She gave us fantastic suggestions for restaurants & attractions in the area. We'd stay with her again in a heartbeat.[QWERTY123]Our stay with Lulu was wonderful! It was our first time using Airbnb and she left a great first impression! We chose to request a stay with Lulu based on her glowing reviews and photos of her space, and our experience didn't disappoint. She made her home feel like our home for a few days and always greeted us with enthusiasm and suggestions to make our trip more authentic. Cozy room, safe and accessible neighborhood, and a perfect host! I highly recommend a stay with Lulu![QWERTY123]Lulu was lovely - very helpful and friendly. Everything was as described - the apartment is neat, clean, very organised and comfortable. Location is great - about 5-10min walk to train station, so about 20 mins to Manhattan. Lulu was available if needed, and had good advice and information. We definitely recommend staying there. Thanks Lulu![QWERTY123]We loved our stay at Lulu's Williamsburg apartment - amazing location, very comfortable apartment with everything we needed and lulu was a very generous and accommodating host. She made our stay a breeze. Will definitely stay again next time we're in NYC. Thanks Lulu![QWERTY123]Great cozy apartment in a lovely neighborhood in NY. Lulu is such a welcoming person, we truly felt at home. The room had a comfortable bed and airconditioning. The kitchen is well equiped to have a nice breakfast in the morning. There is one bathroom to share with another airbnb room, but we did not had any inconvenience concerning that. I would really recommend this place to anyone. the apartment is super cute and has everything you need and the neighborhood is full of nice bars and restaurant with metro stations close by. Thanks Lulu![QWERTY123]- Although the building looks a bit run down, Lulu's apartment is clean, colourful, and beautifully furnished. Our room was spacious and the air conditioner worked. The kitchen was large and well equipped, and we frequently cooked.
 - Williamsburg is an awesome neighbourhood. There are a plethora of restaurants, cafes, and bars, a ""flea food market"" (Smorgasburg) every Saturday, vintage clothing stores, and an excellent bookstore (Spoonbill and Surgartown). The apartment is in walking distance of two large supermarkets (Foodtown and Harvest) and two train stations (Bedford Av on the L line and Marcy Av on the J, M and Z lines). Finally, there are some nice parks by East River with views of Manhattan.
 - Lulu was an outstanding host. She was extremely generous and went above and beyond to make sure we were comfortable and enjoying our time in Brooklyn. This even extended to helping set up a dental appointment during a minor dental emergency!
- We absolutely recommend staying with Lulu if you are staying in Brooklyn.[QWERTY123]Our stay at Lulu's was perfect and without complaint. She was there to greet us warmly and we felt at home straight away. The room is larger than I expected with heaps of space for luggage - and we had a lot! The air conditioning was amazing and welcome relief after our long hot days walking around NY. Special note to her brand new bathroom - the shower is amazing! Thanks Lulu for an awesome week.[QWERTY123]L'appartement était parfaitement conforme à l'annonce, très spacieux, avec une cuisine partagée. Lulu est une hôte assez remarquable, très chaleureuse qui nous a accueilli de la meilleur des manières et en nous donnant de nombreux conseils pour les visites aux alentours. Un très bon voyage grâce à elle ![QWERTY123]Lulu was the nicest host. She made was feel very welcome. The apartment is located close to restaurants, stores and subway station.[QWERTY123]Eventhough Lulu wasn't in town when we stayed in her apartment, checking in and out was easy and straight forward. We arrived late (around 9pm) and left late (7.30pm) - both wasn't a problem at all. 
The area (Williamsburg) is an awesome place to ""live"" when visiting NYC. The places to eat which Lulu recommends in her welcome booklet are great! (Definitely try the ""steak & egg breakfast"" in the Rabbithole :)).[QWERTY123]We had a great stay at the apartment of Lulu. The apartment and our room was clean and comfortable. It is well located close to shops, restaurants and bars in the great neighbourhood Williamsburg. Lulu was a great host. Very friendly and helpful, providing tips and helping out with all questions.[QWERTY123]Lulu is very friendly and helpfuly host. We had a nice stay in Williamsburgh. 
The whole apartment was very clean so we feel comfortably.[QWERTY123]Very nice and cozy appartment in the center of Williamsburg! The appartment was very clean and well maintained. Also great thanks to Lulu for being so hospitable! As a true New Yorker, she gave us some great tips on what to do and how to enjoy our trip to the fullest :-)[QWERTY123]Lulu was truly an amazing host during our stay. Even though the building/apartment is old and quite a walk up with our luggage (we missed that little bit before confirming our stay), it was well decorated, cozy and it felt a lot like home. And oh! I REALLY LOVE the roof of the building, BEAUTIFUL! 

The area has nice cafe's, shops, a grocery store and if you were to walk a little further, you have my personal favorite, the thrift stores. As mentioned by Lulu during our stay, the area is generally safe and we didn't feel at any moment threatened but of course, we still took necessary precautions. People there do their own thing and are generally nice and helpful.

If I do ever come back to New York, Lulu's would be the first I'd look for, even with a heavy luggage and the walk up. 

- Hanis[QWERTY123]We knew that this would be an excellent experience from our initial enquiry where Lulu was fantastic to communicate with, and was so friendly and helpful off the bat. 

Lulu's beautiful, colourful Brooklyn home was warm and inviting, with Lulu waiting up to welcome us in despite our late flight. She was bubbly, friendly, and more than happy to help recommend anything that we needed. She was happy to give us complete space, or chat in the kitchen if we wanted. 

The house is lovely. Beautiful, clean, remodelled bathroom. Light and clean room with a memory foam mattress on the bed. It's in a fantastic location just 5 mins walk from the station (L line to Manhattan) with some excellent bars and restaurants around). We always felt completely safe at all times in the neighbourhood. 

Finally, we had a particularly special trip, where we became engaged in NYC! Lulu greeted the news like she had been our friend for years and offered the most amazing recommendation for a jewellers. As such we were able to leave NY with a new ring to go with the memories. 

We will definitely be staying here again if we come through New York, and will recommend it to all our friends![QWERTY123]Lulu is a very nice host !! She provided us some good advice to discover her neighborhood (restaurants, event, ...) . And it was not indicated in our tourist guide :))
The apartment is very clean, bright, very well-located and in compliance with the photos. Williamsburg is so cool ! We used the subway (Bedford station) to reach Manhattan and it was very easy !! We highly recommand this cosy bedroom and we hope to come back !
Cécile & Anthony[QWERTY123]I highly recommend this place if you are visiting NYC. The area is ideal, so many good bars and places to eat around. Both Rayner and Lulu were extremely helpful and responsive and we felt very welcome.  Would stay here again most definitely.[QWERTY123]this accomodation fulfilled our needs well.[QWERTY123]Lulu's communication before my trip was brilliant.  I knew she wasn't going to be there during my stay but she made sure I was very well informed and introduced me to the apartment manage who took over the communication as the dates drew near.

Really well located apartment and very homely.  The bed was so comfortable!

I met a few other guests who all said how great Lulu's communication had been and were really pleased with the accommodation.  Would definitely stay there again.[QWERTY123]Great flat in a great location. Lulu was excellent to deal with and we would defiantly go back.[QWERTY123]We had a great stay at Lulu's apartment. The location is so perfect with lots of restaurant options around and so close to the subway. The room itself was very spacious! We would definitely stay here again if we come back to NY.[QWERTY123]We had a great stay a lulu's place. It was Super clean and cozy. The bed was amazing and the apartment has a peaceful vibe about it. It's got everything you need for a comfortable stay. The house manager was super friendly and helpful. And the surrounding area is full of great bars and restaurants. For the price we paid we were very surprised just how nice it was. Would stay here anytime we visit NYC again. 

Myles and Gina.[QWERTY123]Je n'ai pas rencontré Lulu personnellement mais l'accueil a été irréprochable: des draps et serviettes propres m'attendaient, ainsi qu'un petit ""guide de bienvenue"" dans l'appartement avec des ""règles de vie"" de l'appartement et bons plans pour restos ou bars du quartier. Lulu s'est montrée soucieuse de mon bien être et de ma bonne installation dans les lieux. L'appartement est spacieux, bien décoré, clair et bien situé (la rue est calme, peu bruyante). Un très bon plan pour visiter New York ET Brooklyn![QWERTY123]We had a great time in NYC and part of it was our stay at Lulu ´s apartment ! 
We fell at home and it was a pleasure to come back and rest  in this cozy place every night :) 
Williamsburg is also the perfect neighborhood to enjoy the city (one stop from Manhattan) and to live the Brooklyn way!
Thank you so much for welcoming us :)[QWERTY123]The apartment is in a great area, it is easy to go to Manhatten, but there are also a lot of nice places to check out in Williamsburg!

Even though Lulu was not in the apartment, she answered our e-mails quickly (both before and during our stay). While we were staying, she wrote us to see if everything was going OK. All in all she was a really attentive and caring host.

The apartment is cozy and charming. However there was no cleaning during our stay (8 nights).

The apartment manager got home three nights in a row around 3 a.m. and was either noisy himself or had brought noisy guests. We were woken by him/them all three nights, and this will (unfortunately) affect our final evaluation.[QWERTY123]Nonostante Lulù non fosse con noi a Ny, è sempre stata molto disponibile e veloce tramite mail. Ci ha reso facile l'ingresso in casa, che era esattamente come nelle foto. Williamsburg davvero un quartiere carino e ben servito!
Camera confortevole e cucina ben attrezzata.Quando la casa è al completo (due stanze di ospiti + un inquilino permanente) purtroppo dopo un paio di giorni sarebbe da ripulire ;)[QWERTY123]It was our first stay in Brooklyn and Williamsburg was a winner for us. Great location of the appartment to get to know the neighbourhood, as well as travel to Manhattan. Lulu was easy to communicate with. We got all the info we needed. Although she wasn't there herself, she had an appartment manager to welcome us. We also had a nice room, with a good matress. You only have to be used to some noice of upstair neighbours or from the street, but nothing we couldn't cope with.[QWERTY123]Very nice apartment. I recommend everyone to go there. Easy to go to Manhattan. There were 5 people staying there. Cleaning is just once every weak. So the bathroom is not clean anymore after a few days. Very good communication by Lulu.[QWERTY123]Everything was great, the apartment was clean. Well connected to Manhattan. The hostess was friendly and well organized. All words of praise.[QWERTY123]Lulu's place is really beautiful and cozy. Everything was well organized and the apartement was clean. We really enjoyed our stay in Williamsburg! It's also easy to get to Manhattan. 
We really recommend this place :)[QWERTY123]Lulu's place was a great home base while I was in New York for 2 weeks. The room was very spacious and the apartment was clean. The area is very vibrant with lots of restaurants and shops within walking distance and the location to 2 different subway stops made getting around super easy.[QWERTY123]Schönes Appartement in einer tollen Lage Williamsburgs. 
Super Anbindungen zur Subway und alles in wenigen Minuten zu erreichen.
Appartement ist gut ausgestattet und sauber, frische Handtücher gabs zwischendurch auch.
Wir hatten das große Schlafzimmer, welches ausreichend Platz bot für uns und zwei Koffer.
Die Aussicht vom Dach rüber nach Manhattan ist sehr schön, die Nachbarschaft ist freundlich und sicher.
Uns hat es gut gefallen!! 
[QWERTY123]Everything was great and easy. Litterally. 
And on top of that an amazing location, right next to Bedford ave. and the L line that takes you to manhattan in 2 minutes.[QWERTY123]Nous avons passé un excellent séjour chez Lulu ! L'appartement était très agréable, le quartier intéressant et Lulu est une hôte parfaite ! Elle nous a aidé comme une véritable amie et nous l'en remercions. Nous retournerons avec grand plaisir chez elle.[QWERTY123]My wife and I loved our stay with Lulu. She went far above and beyond to help us to have a great stay. She was so very helpful with everything from places to eat, transportation,and much, much more. It was an absolute pleasure sharing life experiences with Lulu and staying at her place.[QWERTY123]Mein Partner und ich hatten einen super Aufenthalt bei Lulu. Die Ankunft und Abreise verliefen reibungslos, alles war klar kommuniziert. Lulu hat sich sehr um uns bemüht. Sie hat uns alles persönlich gezeigt und erläutert wie was zu handhaben ist. Obwohl das Gebäude von Aussen nicht wirklich den Anschein macht: die Wohnung ist wirklich cozy, sauber und sehr gut ausgestattet. Einzig zu berücksichtigen: die Wohnung hat sich im 5. Stock befunden. Falls jemand Mühe hat mit Treppen steigen, so könnte dies zum Problem werden, da es keinen Lift hat und die Stufen sehr klein sind. 

Ansonsten: wir würden sofort wieder nach Williamsburg zu Lulu kommen. Herzlichen Dank![QWERTY123]What a wonderful place to exploring NYC.

Easy access to Manhattan with the L train. 

Lulú is a great host :  she gave us a warm welcome and she has been always helpful. It was a pleasure to meet her !

The rooftop is very cool to see the Manhattan skyline.[QWERTY123]Lulu is a Fantastic host. She accommodated us before regular checkin time which is awesome! Location is very nice too! Would def recommend it to anyone looking to stay in Brooklyn!![QWERTY123]We (Jörg (37) and Anja (30)) had a really great time in New York and Lulu was a wonderful host. She is a really nice person, always reachable (even, if necessary, late at night) and more than friendly.  The room ist exactly how discribed and there is even a person that cleans it at least once a week. The house is old and looks a bit like it, but the neighborhood is really nice and we always felt safe and very welcomed. Especially the rooftop is really cool.  Feels a bit like Berlin - Kreuzberg :-)
You can reach the subway in an about 10min walk and after only one station you are in Manhattan. 

We can kindly reccomand to stay at Lulus place! If we come back to New York, we will be there again.[QWERTY123]Perfect! A wonderful and clean apartment, located to lots of bars, restaurants and shops in  Williamsburg. Lulu is a great host and gave us lots of helpful tips. Highly recommend![QWERTY123]Me and my girlfriend stayed 2 weeks in Lulu's apartment and I'm sure this made the difference during our trip. Her location is perfect for those who are looking forward to explore Brooklyn or Manhattan because it's located in the heart of Williamsburg, nearby the metro lines L, M, J and Z (less than 5 minutes walking to the Bedford Av or Marcy stations then one or two stops from Manhattan) and so we were hanging out the whole day and didn't take a cab besides from the airport . Also you got everything you need close to the building: pharmacies, groceries, ATM, bakeries, bars, restaurants, medical center etc.
Lulu provides all the kitchen facilities and the washing machine for the guests. The bedroom was quite clean and cozy with AC / Heater, pillows and bed sheet were really comfortable as well. The bathroom is in the common area but it was Always clean! By the way Lulu's got a cleaner twice a week who helps to keep the place organized.
I've got say that Lulu is the kind of person that you meet and just a few minutes later looks like she's an old friend. She is absolutely helpful and friendly, helped us with many tips and if you need she answers texting really quick.
I'm looking forward for the next trip to NYC and for sure I'll try to book her flat again. I definitely recommend her airbnb.[QWERTY123]We enjoyed a lot our stay at Lulu's place! Perfect place to enjoy the town.
Williamsburg is awesome. You've got all you need in the apartement and Lulu had let us a very helpfull guide to enjoy our stay and to understand the rules of the common life. 
Tynneal (The apartement manager) was very friendly (thanks for your yummy apple pie ! ^_^). The only downside is that you don't want to leave!!! We want to go back!
Tynneal you're welcome if you wanna visit France !

♥♥♥[QWERTY123]The host canceled this reservation 258 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.[QWERTY123]We loved the flat and our room (main room) at Lulu's place. The location is great for exploring Williamsburg and getting into Manhattan. Because of the subway It's actually easier to get to Manhattan from this place than it is to Bed-Stuy or Bushwick (if you're interested in exploring those areas). Overall Brooklyn is an amazing place and Lulu's location is excellent. 

Tynneal, the apartment manager, was lovely: super friendly and had great suggestions for things we could check out.  And Lulu, who was away at the time, was great at keeping in touch via email/AirBnB messenger to make sure everything was working out for us.

There were other people staying in the guestroom, but never any clashes with bathroom times etc. though the floorboards throughout are a bit noisy so you will definitely hear them moving around, but it's not anything to worry about unless you're a reeeeaaaaally light sleeper! 

The place is immaculately clean, and very tidy, but also homely and we cooked breakfast once or twice which saved a bit of cash. 

Would definitely recommend people this place to anyone looking to visit New York. Fell in love with the area.

Thanks again Lulu, hopefully we'll be back!

Marietta + Fergal[QWERTY123]Lulu's place was a really nice spot to stay in NYC. The room was nice and spacious, especially by new york standards and the place as a whole is very homely and I loved the character of it. The laundry facilities were handy too!

The location was convenient with quick access to 2 subway lines, particularly the JMZ for either heading into Manhatten or access to JFK. Really love the neighbourhood too, Southaide of Williamsburg has retained some character with all the gentrification in the area.

Lulu was out of town, however communication was very good and Tynneal, her apartment manager, was super friendly and great for a chat or any pointers. I'd stay again in a heartbeat.[QWERTY123]Lulu's flat is really well situated to visit Manhattan and Brooklyn and really cute. The flatmate Tynneal is lovely. 
We had a good time in NY 
Many thanks[QWERTY123]Stay away from Manhattan's tourists traps and live Williamsburg. Right next to Bedford Avenue, Lulu's apartment offers a welcoming experience. Strongly recommend.[QWERTY123]Elegir la casa de Lulu para quedarnos en nuestra visita a Nueva York ha sido un gran acierto. Muy fácil acceso a Manhattan con varias líneas de metro que hay a unos minutos caminando. Barrio tranquilo y muy animado con bastantes comercios a los alrededores para cualquier cosa que necesites. Si regresamos a la ciudad, no dudaremos en volver a casa de Lulu.[QWERTY123]we had a really great time at Lulu's apartment and the apartment manager Tynneal was such a nice and welcoming person. The apartment was very clean and the metro to manhatten is a 4 min walk distance.[QWERTY123]The location was fantastic and the rooms were lovely. Lulu's apartment is ideal for anyone trying to visit New York on a budget.[QWERTY123]The location was perfect as my son lives in the East Village. I can be picky about my lodging and thought this place was just perfect for me!:)[QWERTY123]Lulu fue muy atenta en nuestra estadía. Siempre nos respondió rápidamente nuestras consultas y nos asesoró en todo aquello que necesitábamos. Es una gran anfitriona! Recomendamos el departamento, muy linda zona, con un lindo centro y gastronomia y cerca de dos estaciones del metro. El departamento muy cómodo y acogedor. Sin duda volveríamos![QWERTY123]Location is very convenient, only five minutes to 2 subway stations.
Communication with host was also good.

But I'd notice that we staid in winter time here and with my gf in one room at the same time in two other rooms were also tenants. So it looked kinda like a hostel with so many people at the Appartmrnt.
It's cold apartment, it's an old building (100+y), noise from streets and noise from warming batteries will not you let to sleep well (used earplugs).
I'd not stay here again.[QWERTY123]Great location. Friendly host. Perfect neighborhood. Walk up 5 floors was good exercise for me. 2 subway lines are easy to access. Thank you for everything Lulu!
他2人とのｼｪｱﾙｰﾑですが､とても快適｡ｴﾘｱも2つの地下鉄ﾗｲﾝが使えてとても便利｡[QWERTY123]Lulu's place is beautiful, in a great location, right near the heart of Williamsburg. She's one of the most welcoming and hospitable people I've met in New York, and is a great host - quick communication and great service. Definitely recommend.[QWERTY123]Had an amazing time at Lulu's place - it's in an excellent location for getting around Brooklyn/Manhattan either by walking via the Williamsburg Bridge or taking the J/L trains. The apartment is clean, cozy and well stocked and I was lucky enough to have some great people staying in the other rooms whilst I was there. 
I'd love to stay here again the next time I visit New York - highly recommended.[QWERTY123]Well situated (lively williamsburg!) and comfortable[QWERTY123]Very nice host. Great location close to some bars and shops[QWERTY123]Very nice place, located in a great area. Lulu is a wonderful host. I totally recommend[QWERTY123]Lu fue una anfitriona excelente, cada día se comunicaba con nosotros para ver si necesitábamos algo, el departamento es bellisimo me sentí como en cada super equipado no deben preocuparse por la ropa ya que tiene una lavadora y secadora excelentes toda equipada la cocina baño perfecto y el estado general del departamento super confortable y accesible gracias Lu por tu tiempo y dedicación[QWERTY123]Good place!feels like home!convenient to sights![QWERTY123]We had a very nice stay at Lulu's place, very comfortable, great neighbourhood, near subway station / one stop from manhattan. Definitely recommend ![QWERTY123]The apartment was very clean and well kept. The room was great and the bed was very comfortable. Great location with a quick train ride over to Manhattan. Really enjoyed our stay.[QWERTY123]Beste Lage. Schöne Wohnung.[QWERTY123]We had such a great time at Lulú's place! Everything was as described and better! The apartment is small but very well decorated and cozy! We would definitely come back when returning to NYC![QWERTY123]Great place, super convenient to the metro and buses. Easy to get to and from Manhattan, however also enjoyed walking around the neighborhood in Williamsburg, came across a lot of great little restaurants and shops. Excellent stay![QWERTY123]Good spot![QWERTY123]Unser Zimmer in Lulu's Wohnung war super schön, gemütlich und sehr sauber. Die Wohnung selbst ist toll ausgestattet und die Küche läd zum kochen und verweilen ein. Die Umgebung und das Haus verdienen das Prädikat ""orginal Brooklyn"" und das frei zugängliche Dach bietet einen tollen Blick über die Stadt, inklusive Blick auf die Skyline von Manhatten. 

Nach einer Woche fühlten wir uns bereits wie echte Williamsburger inklusive Stammlokal und Lieblings-Deli...

Jederzeit wieder. ..[QWERTY123]Nous avons passé un bon séjour chez Lulu. Il y a trois chambres qui sont loués donc il faut accepter de partager les espaces communs avec des inconnus. Les chambres ne ferment pas à clé.
Mais l'appartement est idéalement situé, à un arrêt de métro de Manhattan.[QWERTY123]Lulú's apartment is everything claimed. A cozy, but comfortable, room in a fifth floor walk-up (pace yourself!). The neighborhood is fun with lots of great options for food, drinks, and party. Yet, it's just far enough off Bedford that it has a quiet Brooklyn neighborhood feel with an old-school family vibe. The bed in this room is comfortable and the windows offer fresh air and nice morning light. The apartment is comfortably furnished and well-appointed. The towels were nice- clean and fluffy. We didn't need it but the washer and dryer is a nice luxury in a NY apartment. The tap water was good to drink and the shower is hot fast. I definitely recommend staying here.[QWERTY123]A comfortable and cozy appartment with its own special style. There is everything you need and the details of your stay are organised in advance with the host giving fast answers and making sure everything is okay. 
We definitely recommend staying here.[QWERTY123]Superbe appartement, bien equipe, tres lumineux et idealement situe au coeur de williamsburg. A noter cependant que depuis notre chambre nous entendions beaucoup le bruit de la rue (mais peut etre pas plus que dans les autres appartements new yorkais ?) Lulu est tres reactive, toujours a disposition et l organisation de notre arrivee / depart a ete tres simple.
Bref, nous recommendons vivement ce lieu pour une visite de New York depuis Brooklyn.[QWERTY123]Great place to stay for exploring New York City. The apartment was clean and the bedroom was comfortable. The Williamsburg neighborhood by itself has a ton to do and explore, places to eat, and its own unique vibe. It took almost no time at all to walk to the nearest subway station and Manhattan was only one stop away which was awesome. The place is located in an awesome spot for exploring and for transportation, we loved it. Lulu is a phenomenal host, she provided a number of recommendations for places to eat, and she was very quick to respond to any questions we had. 5/5 stars would stay again.[QWERTY123]You’ll love the location!![QWERTY123]Muy linda experiencia, excelente decisión quedarnos en casa de Lulú. Volvería mil veces.

Gracias![QWERTY123]Wir haben den Aufenthalt bei Lulu sehr genossen. Schöne Wohnung in einer echt super Gegend.[QWERTY123]Eine super gelegene Unterkunft. Alles ist schnell erreichbar. der Blick vom Dach ist herrlich, das Apartment gemütlich. Es gibt frei Kaffee und Tee. Das Bad ist ein bisschen klein, allerdings gab es nie Probleme deswegen. Es ist sauber und gut organisiert. Wir haben uns sehr wohl gefühlt und können Lulus Apartment unbedingt weiterempfehlen.[QWERTY123]Great place, I am very happy that I stay there.[QWERTY123]Lulús apartment is really pretty and colourful :) the bathroom is very small and the building seems old, but we didn't mind. You find everything you need in the kitchen. 
We loved the surrounding area of Williamsburg and would really recommend a street art tour. Still, you reach Manhattan very easy through two metro stations near the house.
The communication was great and the check-in flexible and easy. We would definitely recommend it!"	40.71155755141048	-73.96217804043016	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/20611	2	85.0	0.833333
59	8225	"Stayed two weeks at Central Park North apt in the budget room. The apartment is really near Subway and buses. Central Park is 1 minute far!. STepahnie is very nice ans just want help you want you need. Very good price for New York and beautiful apartment. Highly recommended.See you for my next time in NYC![QWERTY123]Stephanie was a wonderful host. She was very knowledgeable about the city and offered great input while my wife and I were considering where to move in New York. The apartment was in a great location and the room was clean. It was very easy to find parking as well. We would recommend her accommodations to anyone.[QWERTY123]Stephanie, Abdoulaye y el pequeño Princeton conforman una familia muy linda, multilingüe. Nos dieron consejos y recomendaciones apenas llegamos y nos trataron muy bien.
El barrio es muy recomendable, cerca de varias líneas de subte y de buses.[QWERTY123]We really enjoyed our stay with Stephanie and her family. Nice room in a quiet neighbourhood in Harlem. Located only one block from Central Park and Subway station. 
Stephanie and her family was very friendly and helpful.  
/Gunilla[QWERTY123]Stephanie was a very genuine lady who did her best to help as much as she could. She is a very busy person so it was sometimes a bit difficult to touch base with her.
Her maison d'art appartment was very quiet, private and well appointed with a classy private (Website hidden by Airbnb) is well located to the subway and a variety of good eateries.
She recommended the nearby jazz place and I was very glad she told me because I thought it was a terrific New york experience.[QWERTY123]We, my son and me, had lovely days at the home of Stephanie, she and her husband where very helpfull and nice. we enjoyed of not beeing in a standard unpersonal hotel but in a private environment. Clean bathroom, room for two a bit small (it was a room with one big bed, but i asked for a additional bed), nice place. so near to he central park (jogging every morning). great area (near to appollo theater, subway etc) thanks Stephanie and family![QWERTY123]My friend and i  stayed with Stephanie for 4 days back in May. She was an excellent host and made us feel so welcome. The location was great and very close walking distance to the metro!! Would definitely stay there again if i went back to New York.[QWERTY123]We loved staying with Stephanie, the only down point was that we had to walk up to the 4th floor with our suitcases because there's no lift in the building.

Greetings Joke and Piet[QWERTY123]Stephanie and her family were very friendly and welcoming. We really enjoyed our stay here, plenty of privacy even though you are in someone's house, very clean and only about a 10-15 minute subway ride into times square.[QWERTY123]Stephanie is a wonderful and friendly (Website hidden by Airbnb) and my wife stayed in her house and she gave us all support !She made us feel  like in our own (Website hidden by Airbnb) takes only 10 minutes to Times Square by subway and it is in front of Central Park.Stephanie's house is a  great and comfortable place to stay in New York.Go and be hosted by Stephanie ,Princeton and little Princeton,a Beatiful and lovely family![QWERTY123]Our stay at Stephanie´s was very nice. She was very nice to us and gave us advice on the city attractions, restaurants, markets and means of transportation. Thanks Stephanie! Cheers[QWERTY123]The apartment is located in Harlem, conveniently one block from the 110th street [A, B, C] and Central Park North [2, 3] subway stations which take you to the more exciting neighborhoods such as Midtown and the Villages. As noted in the description, the apartment is located on the 4th floor and requires you to walk up very narrow flights of stairs. Hence, if you have lots of heavy luggage and/or are physically unable to walk up stairs, it may not be convenient. Note that the bathroom is shared with the guests in the other room. I did not have any difficulty with scheduling usage but if you like privacy, keep this in mind. Also, I noted a strange smell in the hallways of the apartment. If you are sensitive to these smells, you may need to hold your nose (as I had to do).[QWERTY123]Although we were unable to meet Stephanie as she was away on business, her husband was very accomodating and helpful. The room and amenities were as described and we had a pleasant stay at their location. Thank you again! :)[QWERTY123]Excellent location. The subway and bus were only a block from the apartment. We could get to Museum Mile in less than 20 minutes from the apartment. We arrived from Florida during a heatwave and the window air conditioner in the bedroom was a welcome relief. Sophie checked us in and made sure we were settled with maps and tour books. The apartment was clean, well kept and as advertised.[QWERTY123]This was a great apartment, very clean and organized. It was very helpful that Sophie had a package ready for me with maps, recommended places and a guide with events happening in NYC. I would have been lost without those guides! Great hospitality. The apartment is located on the northern part of Manhattan which is more residential and less touristy, but very close to the subway station. Great hosts, thank you so much for everything![QWERTY123]Had a nice few days at Stephanie's place. Stephanie was not there, but a friend/partner of hers met me and set up my visit. She was helpful and friendly as was Stephanie's husband. Slight confusion about my check in day, but it worked out with little drama. Room wasn't decorated or anything, but clean with an a/c unit, desk and comfortable bed.  Shared clean bathroom with other travelers who were also friendly. I felt comfortable with everyone there. Wifi access worked well. Location convenient to subway systems and a few businesses one avenue over. Fourth floor walkup, which was not a problem for me, but others should take note. Again, I had a good experience here.[QWERTY123]Sophie and Stephanie's husband were very hospitable. The location is good, very close to transportation. It just wasn't that clean, I found some bugs in the kitchen drawer. Other than that it was ok.[QWERTY123]Excellent value for money, a very clean tidy apartment. and plenty of clean linen.  Using the kitchen and late checkout a real bonus. Stephanie was away but Sophie was friendly and helpful, Sharing a bathroom could be a problem with inconsiderate other guests.  Close to Subway stations[QWERTY123]Stephanie was not in town while I was there, but her husband was present and he was very nice and helpful. Stephanie's friend, Sophie, met us, gave us the keys and a tour of the apartment. She also provided maps, an events brochure and local restaurant ideas. The whole house was clean. My friend and I needed to leave our bags at the apartment after we checked out and they were very accommodating. It was a wonderful experience.[QWERTY123]Stephanie and husband were very friendly and gave lots of helpful info about the area when we got there. The room and apt were clean and pleasant. They were available to chat, yet were not intrusive at all. Quiet apt overall. Fellow guest was polite and cooperative too, in regards to sharing the bathroom.[QWERTY123]Stephanie is a wonderful host, we were made to feel very welcome and comfortable for our stay in New York. Very convenient location near the subway and central park, close enough to get to Times Square in about 15 minutes but far enough out to escape the tourists when you've had enough. Stephanie has lots of knowledge about where to go and what to see in the local area, more than willing to share information but also gives you space and privacy. Would love to have had the time to explore more of Harlem itself.[QWERTY123]Good location, good price and nice hosts. Thank you for your hospitality and help throughout the city. We enjoyed our stay! Tip: go to the baptist church on sunday, it's located near the apartment and is truly worth experiencing.[QWERTY123]un accueil familial très touchant. A proximité des métro bus ... Calme de la chambre, propreté. Notre séjour chez Stéphanie a été extra[QWERTY123]STephanie's cozy room was a major godsend for my girlfriend and i . We braved the highways and drove up from D.C. to Harlem for a reading I was a part of at NYC. We knew the hotels were super pricey and we decided to try airbnb on a whim. Best decision ever. Stephanie's friend met us with the keys once we arrived and led us to our small bedroom. Although there were other guests there, we mostly saw Stephanie, her hubby Abulai, and their cute as a button son. Great location to the subway and it was nice to be able to walk less than a few feet and end up right at the top of Central Park.

We lucked out that Friday afternoon and found a great parking spot across the street and we left our car there the whole weekend with no problems or tickets.

We read in one persons description that there was a weird smell in the apartment. Not true. If anything, the stairwell of the building was where the weird smell was and the apartment smelled fine.  Over all a great time was had. We didn't really use the kitchen at all or the living room space because we were out in the city during the day, but overall we felt welcomed, safe, and secure.[QWERTY123]Stephanie's family and apartment was great, we stayed for a week at her house and it was the best. NY offers a really tiring experience and you need to have a good night's sleep to keep up with its speed, and staying at Stephanie's really made that possible. One of the best things about it was the closeness to 2 subway stations, central park is just one block to the south. Great neighborhood, very calm. Also her family was the best, her husband was really nice to us and we loved her little boy. As an extra tip you should visit her art gallery, great exhibits of artists around the world.[QWERTY123]Stephanie is a great host, she is friendly, welcoming and gave us all the information we needed to have a great time in New York city. Her place is in a great location with easy access to the subways and buses. We would defiantly stay here again and would recommend it to others if you are on a budget but want to stay close to the city in a clean and comfortable place.[QWERTY123]Très bonne expérience avec Stéphanie et sa famille, accueillante et enthousiaste. L'hébergement est de qualité, et l'environnement agréâble à souhait.
Un plan de la ville, ainsi qu'une liste de toutes adresses utiles était prêts à notre arrivée.
Le lieu est très facile d'accès en métro, taxi et est à deux pas de Central Park Nord.
I.D.É.A.L
Allez-y sans hésiter, très bon rapport qualité/ prix sur l'offre![QWERTY123]Stephanie was a fantastic host and her apartment a wonderful place to rest and recoup after long days of sightseeing!

Le logement est extrêmement confortable, et très bien situé (10 minutes de Times Square avec la ligne 2 de métro/2 minutes à pieds du Nord de Central Park). De plus, la famille de Stéphanie est formidable : très accueillante, elle vous met à l'aise, et est d'une aide précieuse pour les périples New-Yorkais.

Pour un prochain séjour, j'y retournerai sans hésiter ! MERCI POUR TOUT ![QWERTY123]Stephanie's apartment was fantastic. The room was absolutely comfortable, the bathroom was impecable and we were not bothered at all by anyone in the house the time we were there. The location was perfect, less than 2 minute walk from two metro stations and less than a minute walk from beautiful central park. Would definitely stay here again![QWERTY123]Great place, pretty good location and very easy to great anywhere you want to go in NYC. STephanie and her family were very friendly and helpful to us![QWERTY123]It was my first time using AirBnb. Me and my 9 year old daughter stayed with Stephanie for 5 days and the experience was amazing! We were received very well and the location is great, very close of everything including the subway station. I will certainly stay there another time and I strongly recommend this place.

Essa foi a primeira vez que usei Airbnb. Eu a minha filha de 9 anos ficamos com Stephanie por 5 dias e a experiencia foi maravilhosa. Fomos muito bem recebidos, a localizacao e' otima, muito perto de uma estacao do (Website hidden by Airbnb) certeza ficaremos la outras vezes e eu recomendo.[QWERTY123]Une tres bon acceuil que ce soit de Stéphanie ou de Sophie (sa collègue).
Un appartement vraiment sympathique et fonctionnel, pas trop mal situé dans Manhattan.
Je le recommande à beaucoup de gens.
Et j'y retournerais volontiers.
Merci beaucoup.[QWERTY123]The room was clean and cozy,Stephanie was very helpful and provided the information regarding to the NYC. I really enjoyed my stay. Only one thing was the floor was cracking when people (Website hidden by Airbnb) mom stayed awake because of this.[QWERTY123]Très bon accueil (plan de la ville et des métros fournis, + de bons conseils) et très bien placé, à 2 minutes du métro.

En résumé super ![QWERTY123]Excellente situation (tout près de Central Park North, à proximité des principales lignes de métro), accueil très chaleureux, chambre et SDB très agréables, appartement confortable et très calme... idéal pour une (re)découverte de New York. Nous conseillons très vivement cette adresse... et nous y retournerons avec grand plaisir ![QWERTY123]Staying at Stephanie's place was just perfect. 
In addition to the place that was very nice and well located,  Stephanie  ans sophie were just great hosts. Giving nice advice, sharing details on nice place to visite in the area. 

Next time we will visit New York, it will be at Stephanie's place.

Nice, place, nice people..... 

June 2012[QWERTY123]Great location close to subway stations and central park.   Stephanie was really helpful and accommodating.[QWERTY123]Stephanie and her lovely family are great hosts. They are very welcoming and fun to talk to. Their house is very close to both the subway and to Central Park which was just excellent. The neighborhood was also a very good place to stay even coming back late at night. All in all a great experience![QWERTY123]Such a lovely family! Really great place - very artsy :) Wonderful location, and the hosts were so welcoming and helpful to us - happy to offer suggestions of anything (especially for the off the beaten track places) Wouldn't hesitate to recommend as it was such a great place to stay.[QWERTY123]Stephanie and her family were awesome hosts! They were very kind and helped us a lot with their hints! Her place is the perfect base for a great New York experience and very close to the metro and the Central Park as well! It was a pleasure to stay there! I'm really looking foreward to stay there again as soon as possible![QWERTY123]Stepahnie is a wonderful host, and I felt very welcome in her apartment. The facilities provided were highly satisfactory, and I would absolutley recommend staying here.[QWERTY123]Stefanie and her family are living in a great location in Harlem.  Next to the subway and nice restaurants.
We didn't know that stafanie, her husband and 3 children were living in the house to.
But they were really quiet and friendly.
Good place to stay.
Stefanie thanks for every thing.


Krista[QWERTY123]Thank you guys for hosting us. In spite of Sandy we had an amazing time in New York and at your place. We enjoyed your neighbourhood and the restaurant suggestions we got from you.
We would recommend you to any other travelers.[QWERTY123]Chez Chic actually is two guest rooms at the appartment of Stephanie and her husband, Abdul. We had a great time and were pleasantly surprised by the hospitality of our hosts. The room we stayed in was small, but the bed was good. Bathroom is shared with the other guests, which means you may have to wait during morning rush hour. Location is great: outside the bustle of down town, but with good connections (subway, bus). Stephanie provides an extensive list of restaurants, cafe's and entertainment options in the neighbourhood, a safe and relatively quiet part of town.
[QWERTY123]Stephanie stay in the house was very nice. Great welcome, the location of the apartment is recommended.
And 'certainly address to report positively.
Stefano[QWERTY123]they are ok[QWERTY123]Stephanie & Abdoulaye were really sweet with us. They give us a lot of tips about New-York and other things. It's the perfect place to stay, it was a really friendly atmospher, my brother and I just loved it! Thank you again Alex&Marc
[QWERTY123]Nous avons passés 5 jours chez Stéphanie et Abdoulaye, nous vous recommandons fortement leur appartement, très bien situé, chambre très propre, mais surtout une famille adorable. Disponible, à l'écoute ils ont facilité notre séjour. Si nous devions retourné à New York, nous n'hésiterions pas une seconde pour revenir chez eux. Un grand merci et bonne route à vous et votre famille[QWERTY123]Stephanie y su marido son dos personas maravillosas. Estuvieron siempre pendientes de todo y nos hicieron sentir como en casa.
Harlem es hermoso y muy tranquilo y seguro.
El departamento es muy cómodo y con una ubicación genial!
Espero poder volver pronto!
Muchas gracias Stephanie y Abdul![QWERTY123]Stephanie and her family were very accomodating. The room and bathroom were clean and set up nicely. Even with three boys living at the apartment, everyone seemed sweet, quiet, and hospitable. Location of the apartment was great-one block away from 2 train station lines and 1 block away from Central Park. Access to the kitchen was definitely a plus. I would not hesitate to recommend Stephanie's purple room #2 again! Merci![QWERTY123]we had a very good time at Stphanie's place. All the family is very nice, the apartment is clean and quiet and very good located (subways are very near and buses as well). The bed is really comfortable and Stephanie is very helpuful for any kind of info or need. I would recommend this place to anyone.[QWERTY123]My friend and I had an incredible stay. Stephanie and her family are really welcoming we made our stay really easy. Their place, even though they have three kids is really calm, just like the neighbourhood. Near to the center but still you get to be in a peaceful area. Would come back for sure![QWERTY123]I had a great stay at Stephanie's place. It's just two blocks from the north end of Central Park, and the room wS clean and comfortable. Stephanie was a very gracious host as well, always prepared to offer recommendations about the neighborhood and the city.[QWERTY123]We had a nice stay at this place. A welcoming and good organised couple. Upon our arrival we received all practical details to get to the flat. In the room there were tips for eating in the neighbourhood and a subway map.... A service like in a real hotel! We shared a bathroom with another couple that stayed in the flat. Bed is comfortable en place was very clean. 
Flat is just a block away from Central Park! And practical with subway because of the various lines passing. 
A place to go![QWERTY123]We stayed at Stephanies place for a week and were very pleased with the location. Stephanie and her quite big family were all very nice and welcoming. Despite that it could at times feel a bit crowded as the apartment is quite small. We were also a bit surprised that cooking availability was limited to only micro wave use in evenings. Overall it was satisfying though as what we prioritize most, location, was perfect![QWERTY123]Première et Très bonne expérience! La chambre correspondait tout à fait à nos attentes et à ce qui est décrit et montré sur airbnb.
Propreté, Propreté & Propreté!! Le quartier est parfait et à 3 arrêts  (10 min) de Times Square. 
Stéphanie et Abdoulaye très sympas et n'hésitent pas à vous aider. 

Click, Book & Enjoy NY City

[QWERTY123]I had a great time at Stephanie's place. It is central, close to the subway, bus stop, grocery stores and central park.

The room and the facilities were very clean and comfortable.

I loved Stephanie's family. Abdul her husband was very nice. She helped us understand the subway system which is crazy if it's your first time in NY. She also gave us some directions of interesting places to visit.

If I had to go back to New York, I'd definitely stay at Stephanie's place again.[QWERTY123]Stephanie is an awesome host her and her cute little family. Do not hesitate, great location near manhattan, everything you need is around and the many subway are situated less than 10 min walking distance.

Merci beaucoup Stephanie[QWERTY123]We had a really nice time at Stepanies home. She was very friendly and made us feeel very wlcome and home. She also knows alot of good places to go everytime we ask her for a good place to go she had very good tipp. The area is also very nice just across the street is the lovely central par and a subwaystation. The apartment ist comfortable and clean. When will come back to New York we will stay here again.[QWERTY123]Super accueil, chambre impeccable, et surtout, le quartier est super! Très facile de se rendre downtown en métro.[QWERTY123]My experience at Chez Chic was exactly what I was expecting....welcoming, safe, and the hosts were always very friendly and accommodating to me.

If you are looking for a simple setup (basic, comfortable room, air conditioning) and don't mind sharing washroom facilities (and it was a never an issue to use it) then I highly recommend staying here.[QWERTY123]Stephanie è stata una host super (Website hidden by Airbnb) giorno del nostro arrivo abbiamo avuto problemi con gli orari e lei è stata comprensiva. .. suo marito e tornato a casa per aprirci quando siamo arrivati. La zona è proprio accanto alla zona nord di Central Park.. con la linea rossa si arriva al centro in 10 minuti scarsi! Ci sono molti locali per bere e mangiare.  Il parco non è assoluta visitabile di sera, ma non ho mai avuto paura tornando alla sera. Il bagno era condiviso con un altra camera ma non ci siamo mai incrociati con loro.[QWERTY123]Fue nuestra primer experiencia en AirBnB y estamos muy satisfechos, la descripción fue exacta de acuerdo a lo que encontramos en el sitio.  Stephanie desde que llegamos nos recibió con información de mapas, compras y lugares para comer que nos fueron muy  útiles y siempre se mostro atenta a nuestras dudas. El lugar esta excelentemente ubicado cerca de dos estaciones de metro y a una calle de central park. Sin duda es una gran opción y la relación entre el costo/ beneficio es bastante justa.[QWERTY123]Staying with Stephanie and her family was great! The home felt like a home to us too, there's a lot of peace, even though there are lots of little people playing around in the mornings! :) 

Afternoons and evenings are very very quiet, and most of the time, the entire place was left to ourselves. They were always nice and helpful and the place was clean.[QWERTY123]Stéphanie, Abdoulaye et leurs enfants nous ont super bien accueilli pour notre première semaine à New York et premier voyage dans cette grande ville tout court.

La chambre est très propre ainsi que toute la maison d'ailleurs. Ils ont été très disponibles et nous ont donnés de très bons conseils.

Leur appartement est bien situé et leurs enfants sont adorables[QWERTY123]Stephanie and Abdoulaye's flat is really awesome. Well paced. 

For our second week in New York we were really confortable and the flat and the room was so clean.

They were really great with us and all their familly too.
They help us to organize our trip in New York and give us good tips.

We will come back here for sure and recommande it to others.

Thanks you Stephanie and Aboudlaye, Adrian, Priceton and Tristan !
[QWERTY123]We enjoyed our stay at Stephanies apartment. Its small but has the conveniences you need. Bed and a shower. We didn't use the kitchen very much bc we chose to eat out. I did get a cup of coffee sometimes from their coffee machine. Her children are quiet and respectful. No problems with noise. They were sweet and cute boys! Stephanie has lots of good information to share about sightseeing and how to get around. She is very polite and a lovely lady. We enjoyed our stay but the 3 flights of stairs with luggage or after a hard day of walking made it difficult for me. I loved the location as far as walking into Central Park. It has some beautiful trails for walking during the day. We had a hard time finding a good breakfast in the area. Just not enough good places until you get over to Broadway and thats where its all at. Thanks again Stephanie for a comfortable, private stay. Hope to see you again .
[QWERTY123]Stephanie is a very interesting person who has a pleasant personality[QWERTY123]El departamento es pequeño pero limpio y con muy buena ubicación (a pocas calles del metro y de Central Park), hay que considerar que no hay ascensor en el edificio, tampoco en la estación del metro. Stephanie es muy amable, con excelentes recomendaciones e interés en las personas; trabaja mucho y es posible que tarde en responder mesnajes (recomiendo más contactarla vía SMS que (Hidden by Airbnb) ), me gustó mucho su trato y el de Abdoulaye, son una excelente opción.[QWERTY123]Esta ha sido la mejor experiencia en airbnd no solo nos permitió estar en su habitación también nos permitió conocer a su excelente familia Stephanie y su familia nos hicieron sentir como en casa y nos proporcionaron todas las facilidades y comodidades para unas vacaciones perfectas ella es una excelente persona y anfitriona. Nos permitimos recomendarla ampliamente[QWERTY123]Nous avons passé un superbe séjour à New York notamment grâce à Stéphanie et sa famille! Stéphanie est toujours de bons conseils et là pour vous aider! La chambre est bien aménagée et très chaleureuse. L’appartement est bien situé dans Harlem, juste au dessus de Central Park et à côté de deux bouches de métro ainsi que d'un super marché.     Nous recommandons donc vivement cet appartement![QWERTY123]Our stay at Stephanie's was fantastic! Her knowledge of New York and willingness to share was so good for us as travellers, and helped us a lot. It's a great location, especially considering there is the express subway station on the next block for a 10-15 min ride to time square. Plenty of local restaurants, laundry, grocers near by. 

Stephanie's family was very welcoming and she has beautiful children! They were all more than happy to have us and well behaved. 

The room is nice, warm and cosy. Comfortable bed and Roku which was great. Thank you Stephanie for a great stay :)[QWERTY123]Séjour formidable et très agréable, l'appartement est bien situé, a 5min a pied de deux principales lignes de métro, la chambre était très confortable, Stéphanie, son mari et ses enfants sont adorables et nous ont donné beaucoup d'infos intéressantes, séjour idéal dans une ville incroyable, accueilli par des personnes chaleureuses, qu'ajouter de plus? Tout était parfait![QWERTY123]Großartig! Stephanie und ihre Familie sind super nett und geben einem sofort das Gefühl zur Familie zu gehören. Als wir ankamen hat Stephanie uns direkt alles gezeigt und erklärt (Metro, wo wir sind und wie wir zu welchen Orten kommen). Die Lage ist total genial. Direkt am Central Park, 5min zur U-Bahn. Die Nachbarschaft ist super um Abends loszugehen und was zu essen und zu trinken.[QWERTY123]Nous avons passés 9 nuits chez Stéphanie. Tout c'est très bien passé. Elle est très dispo pour nous donner des infos pour ce qui est sympa à faire... Elle a une petite famille très accueillante. La chambre est agréable. La cuisine à disposition.. Il y a même du café ! Merci pour ce séjour et nous reviendrons un jour.[QWERTY123]Friendly house! Great experience and location.  Book it!!![QWERTY123]Abdoulaye ( Stephanie's husband ) greeted us and invited us in, I was in constant contact with Sophie and Stephanie the entire time and they were very responsive.  The apt itself is located within 5 min walking distance to the subway which was great.  The room was clean and had its own efficient air conditioning.  We didn't spend much time in the apt but everything was very clean and nice.[QWERTY123]체크인 당일 아침에 이메일로 연락을 받았습니다.
물이 새는 바람에 보수공사를 하게 되었으니
숙박이 어렵고 대신에
멘하탄 중앙에 있는 힐튼 호텔 2박을 결제 해두었으니
그곳에서 숙박하는게 좋을것 같다고 하였습니다.
 
 물론 힐튼 호텔의 가격은 어떻게 보아도
결제 하였던 액수보다 더 비쌌습니다.

 덕분에 즐거운 여행이 되었습니다.
다시금 감사드립니다.[QWERTY123]It was a good place to stay very close of the subway and the host is a nice person.[QWERTY123]very kindly . will stay here next time[QWERTY123]The neighborhood is absolutely beautiful with great restaurants, the train, Central Park, and Columbia U all right there! Stephanie is a sweet host with a great love for the city![QWERTY123]Really great night! we weren't home much but the subway is right around the corner and Mizi was very welcoming!!![QWERTY123]Stephanie was very hospitable and welcoming! She gave maps of the city and recommendations for places to eat and nightlife. She also allowed me to stay an extra night when my flight was cancelled. The location is very close to the subway as well and makes for easy travel.[QWERTY123]We rented two rooms at Chez Chic and all of us had an amazing time there. We did not want to leave! We were made to feel so welcome by the host. She made sure we felt at home and gave us advice on all the best places to eat. She let us check in late and on short notice too! The apartment has the most amazing artwork decorating it giving it a New York artistic atmosphere. The location is right by Central Park and lots of great food. There was a TV in the room with hulu and netflix which is a nice touch.  The price is also great.  We will definitely stay here again when we come back to NYC![QWERTY123]Stephanie was a great host, friendly and helpful whenever we needed anything.[QWERTY123]Mi primer experiencia en Airbnb y excelente, Mizi una excelente anfitriona, su casa se encuentra excelentemente ubicada y puedes vivir la experiencia neoyorquina por completo[QWERTY123]Mizi ha sido una buena anfitriona. Muy amable ella y toda su familia.
El apartamento esta en una zona muy tranquila y  bien ubicado.
Siempre dispuesta a responder nuestras preguntas sobre la ciudad o sobre el tema que necesitaramos.
Sin dudas un lugar al que volveremos.[QWERTY123]Bien placé juste au nord de Central Park. Bon accueil. Métro à 100m pour rejoindre Time Square et Midtown en 20mn.[QWERTY123]We had a great time here! Stephanie and her husband are very friendly and gave us a few good hints about the city. The room and bathroom were very clean, towels were provided. It's a very good location, with several supermarkets down the street and the subway only a 2 min walk away. Central park is only one street away, perfect for an evening run! We had a great stay and i world very recommend it.[QWERTY123]En plus du séjour, l'appartement et ses occupants sont au top. Situé au nord de central park, c'est un grand plus pour découvrir le quotidien. Encore un très grand merci à Stéphanie et ta petite famille[QWERTY123]When I arrived in airport,Mizi tell me something urgent and booked another hotel for us. It make me very surprise. Finally we lived well in hotel.[QWERTY123]La anfitriona nos recibió el primer día. Es una persona muy atenta y educada. Nos hizo sentir bien en su casa. La habitación y el baño son tal cual se muestra en las fotos. La casa esta ubicada en un barrio muy tranquilo, sin ruidos nocturnos. Un lugar ideal para descansar. No hicimos uso de la cocina.[QWERTY123]Es nuestra primera vez en AirBnB y nos gustó mucho. Mizi nos proporcionó todo lo que necesitábamos. El lugar está limpio, su familia es linda y sus hijos son muy silenciosos. Mizi es muy amable y alegre. Nos hubiera gustado convivir más con ella y con su esposo, pero la pasamos conociendo N.Y. Excelente experiencia.[QWERTY123]Everything was great. Central Park is beautiful and so close. There a bike rental shop down the street and plenty of restaurants.
[QWERTY123]Mizi fue maravillosa. Nos estaba esperando el dia que llegamos para darnos las llaves y mostrarnos el departamento. Nos entregó dos sets de toallas que no esperabamos. Mizi fue siempre fue encantadora y nos dio buenos datos de cosas que hacer y lugares a donde ir. El departamento queda a una calle del metro y frente a la entrada norte a Central Park. También hay un Deli cruzando la calle y supermercado al lado de la estación del metro. Nos gustó mucho el lugar y volveríamos felices.[QWERTY123]Mizi was a wonderful host.  Made us feel right at home.  Very flexible and great communication.  The location is fantastic too.  Couldn't ask for anything more.  Thank you!!![QWERTY123]We had a wonderful time and experience, and Mizi's apartment was perfect for our needs! 1min walk to Central park, 5mins to a bunch of local bars/ restaurants and shops. We really couldn't have asked for anything more convenient, and at such a great cost. Thanks guys![QWERTY123]Mizi family are very friendly and kind.  We really enjoy this travel in NYC.[QWERTY123]Mizi es una excelente anfitriona, nos explico muy bien lo que teniamos que hacer y nos enseño los planos de la cuidad. La habitacion tiene aire acondicionado que sirve mucho en el verano de NY, tiene TV y wifi que funciona muy bien, ademas esta cerca del central park y a 2 cuadras del subway, la recomiendo 100%.[QWERTY123]Chez Chic was the perfect place for our NY visit. It is simple, but very clean and comfortable. And the location is hard to beat for the price. Mizi was a great host as well. She gave us detailed instructions about the city and was friendly in conversation. I look forward to staying with her again on my next visit.[QWERTY123]The host canceled this reservation 7 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.[QWERTY123]My family stayed at Mizi's apartment. It was amazingly convenient and everything was advertised.

Communication was clear and the stay was enjoyable. Would recommend to anyone and would stay again.
[QWERTY123]Mizzi  fue muy atenta, nos hizo sentir como  en casa. Nos ayudo con cualquier  duda que teníamos y nos proporcionó  un mapa. Dormitorio, baño y cocina cómodos. Barrio seguro, cerca de Central Park. Recomendado![QWERTY123]We had such a great time in NYC and such a comfy place to stay! The room was very clean, big enough and comfortable. You can tell that the beds are pretty new and we slept so well. The bathroom, we shared with other guest, has been cleaned up regulary and has everything you need to get ready.
Mizi was such a great host. She welcomed as very nicely at the time we set up before. She profided a map and gave as all the informations we asked for and recommend some places you should visit while you are in the city. 
It has been easy to find the place. The surrounding is safe and nice. When you leave the place you can already see Central Park and it's not even a five minute walk to the next subway stations - the Line 2+3 and B+C are really close. 
We would always come back!!!![QWERTY123]Séjour très agréable dans l'appartement de Mizi partagé avec sa famille sympathique. La situation du logement est idéale pour visiter Manhattan. juste à l'entrée de Central Park, il permet de très belle balade dans le parc et même d'y faire son jogging ou du vélo (location juste à côté). Quelques rues plus loin on y trouve des restaurants et petit supermarché, très pratique ainsi que 2 stations de métros pour rejoindre le coeur de Manhattan. Merci Mizi![QWERTY123]I cannot say enough good things about our stay at this lovely apartment! It was warm and inviting and you felt ""at home"" from the moment you stepped through the door. Mizi is such a warm and friendly person and her family was beautiful! The beds are very comfortable and the room is a great size (I shared it with my 2 teen daughters) There is a shared bathroom that was always clean. The apartment is located in a perfectly convenient spot. Subway entrance is 3 min walk. There's a Dunkin Donuts a block one way and a market, Starbucks and wine shop and local cafe the other. If you go in the winter, there is a great ice skating rink in Central Park that is a 5 min walk. We will definitely stay at this sweet place again![QWERTY123]Our arrival day was very stressful. But Stephanie was welcoming us with open arms. Sie showed us the appartement, told us where we could do some grocery shopping and let us sleep. 
We shared the bathroom with another room, but that was fine. 
There are plenty of restaurants and metro stations in walking distance. 
We really had a great time.
Thank you![QWERTY123]Perfetto! Vicino alla fermata della metropolitana[QWERTY123]Mizi was always available to help us with what we needed and was flexible at check-out.[QWERTY123]Es la primera vez que utilizo Airbnb y realmente el apartamento de Mizi es sumamente genial, muy limpio, muy confortable. Esta cerca de una estación del metro para poder ir a toda la ciudad. La experiencia de tener el central park a una calle es totalmente una excelente experiencia maravillosa. Se vivió como neoyorquino, como si realmente fuera de la ciudad , sumamente recomendable. Mizi y su familia son unas excelentes personas eso es de admirarse ya que estuvieron al pendiente desde que el avión aterrizo, demasiado atentos, en verdad recomiendo este apartamento al 100%. La calidad humana con la que nos trato Mizi y su familia es sumamente increíble. En resumen una excelente ubicación, grandes personas que nos tratan como parte de su familia. Lo recomiendo porque es no ir de turista si no de vivir como un neoyorquino. 100%Recomendable!!![QWERTY123]Wir wurden herzlich von Mizi begrüßt. Da ich leider krank war versorgte sie mich gleich mit einem leckeren Tee. Die Unterkunft ist ca 18 Minuten mit der Subway vom Times Square entfernt und liegt direkt am Central Park. Ich würde diese Unterkunft definitiv wieder buchen. Mizi lebt dort mit ihrer Familie... wer also Kinder mag und mal einen Einblick in den amerikanischen Alltag bekommen möchte ist hier genau richtig. Ich habe mich dort sehr wohl gefühlt. Man kann auch in Harlem gut shoppen, es gibt viele Supermärkte und die Subwaystation ist innerhalb von 5 Minuten zu Fuß zu erreichen. 

[QWERTY123]Nous avons passé une très bonne semaine chez Mizi et son adorable famille. Nous nous sommes sentis comme ""à la maison"" à tel point que nous n'avons pas vu venir le jour du départ. La chambre est très bien grande pour deux personnes voir 3 (lit superposé avec lit double en bas et lit simple en haut). Idéalement situé, à 2 pas de Central Park et des lignes de métros B,C et 2,3. En 10min à peine on est en plein cœur de Manhattan. Merci encore Stéphanie pour votre accueil :)[QWERTY123]Un séjour parfait chez Stéphanie, merci pour tout! 
Une chambre propre, agréable dans un bel appartement situé juste au nord de central park et à 200m de deux bouches de métro. Appartement à 15min en métro de Times Square. 
Stéphanie est disponible pour nous aider et le fait qu'elle soit française est un gros plus. 

Bref, je vous recommande +++++ 

Merci Stéphanie!![QWERTY123]Wir verbrachte 12 sehr schöne Tage in New York. Die Unterkunft, die uns Stephanie (Mizi) geboten hatte war sauber und ruhig. Die Lage war einmalig, direkt am Nordrand des Central Park gelegen, zwei Subway Stationen in unmittelbarer Nähe. Ein Spaziergang abends durch Harlem war völlig problemlos. Es gab viele Einkaufsmöglichkeiten und Gaststätten in der Umgebung. 
Stephanie war sehr freundlich und immer ansprechbar. Wir hatten viel Spaß zusammen. Morgens haben wir in der Küche gefrühstückt und sie  hatte ihre beiden Söhne für die Schule fertig gemacht. So hatte man auch einen kleinen Einblick in das amerikanische Familienleben. 
Geschätzt haben wir die Nähe zum Central Park. Einen frischen Salat, Brot und Getränke besorgt, ab in den Park 
und das Picknick genossen.  Herrlich diese Ruhe nach einem hektischen Tag in der Innenstadt. 
Wir können diese Unterkunft uneingeschränkt empfehlen. 




[QWERTY123]Great hospitality, completely reliable people![QWERTY123]Great host here. Location is right on Central Park and close to the subway. We fit 3 of us in one bedroom and it worked out perfectly. Thanks to this great deal of a place to rest we were able to enjoy the city very easily. Future repeat customer here.[QWERTY123]We had a wonderful time staying in this beautiful apartment with her and her family! While its on the 4th floor and there is many stairs to climb, we had an overall great experience. Got to share the bathroom with on other room - if the other room is booked. Thats really the only problem we faced. Whenever we tried to use the bathroom someone was almost always in there. There is an air conditioner in the room, if you stay in the warmer months. The room is comfortable for three - there is a bunk bed in the room. There is a TV - not that you'll use it. The apartment is in an amazing location. Around the corner is a deli, dunkin dounuts, and the subway which connects you to the 2 and 3 train. If you go the opposite direction there is another subway at the corner of central park which connects you to the A, C, B, and D train. Stephanie is very helpful, and patient. Expecally because we told her we'd get there at one time - but our flight ended up getting extreamly delayed. Had an amazing stay here, and would recommend it to anyone who is coming to new york.[QWERTY123]Mizi was great, nice place, her family so cute, I don't forget her hospitality and amiability, Place recomended 100% .[QWERTY123]Eu e meu marido ficamos no apartamento da Mizi e foi incrível.
A localização é excelente, é bem pertinho do Central Park e o bairro é tranquilo e residencial. O quarto é ótimo, silencioso e mais amplo do que imaginávamos. A cama e travesseiros também são excelentes. O banheiro é muito bom e o fato de dividi-lo com outros hóspedes não foi inconveniente nenhum.
No primeiro dia da nossa hospedagem a Mizi nos reservou um hotel em Midtown (os hóspedes anteriores precisaram ficar um dia a mais) e ela nos pagou um taxi no dia seguinte do hotel ate o apartamento.
A Mizi é muito atenciosa e dá todas as dicas principalmente referente às facilidades do bairro.
Durante nossa hospedagem ela teve que viajar e ficou ausente por alguns dias. Neste período tivemos pequeno problema com a limpeza e higiene na cozinha (que é uma área compartilhada com os demais).
Mas este problema foi muito pequeno perto dos momentos maravilhosos que tivemos em NY e no apartamento.
Fizemos confusão com o horario do check out e sabemos que ocasionou um transtorno com a limpeza do quarto para os proximos hóspedes e agradecemos à Mizi imensamente pela sua compreensão e flexibilidade.[QWERTY123]Très pratique pour un séjour à New York 
Très bon accueil, bien placé, proche de Central park et des transports en commun un excellent accueil qui nous a ravies.[QWERTY123]The host canceled this reservation the day before arrival. This is an automated posting.[QWERTY123]La estadía en la casa de Mizi fue excelente Tanto ella como su familia siempre dispuestos a ayudarnos  Sin dudas volvería a la casa de Mizi[QWERTY123]The best Airbnb we can hope! Mizi's family is wonderful, kind and generous. We cannot have a better host. She makes us feel at home and even more. I will come back without hesitation. 
The room was confortable and the appartement too. It is 2 min walk from Central Park, perfect for a running or a picnic and 5 min from markets and subway. A perfect location. 
Thank's again for Mizi and her family for this amazing experience.[QWERTY123]Persona amable y disponible.[QWERTY123]Excelente todo, cerca a la estacion del metro y facil acceso al transporte, supermercado y lavanderia de facil acceso, restaurantes variados. esperamos volver pronto. EAFA[QWERTY123]On a passé un super séjour avec la famille de Mizi, ils sont d’une gentillesse exceptionnelle et toujours prêt à rendre service. Ils sont très accueillants. La chambre est parfaite, et l’appartement n’est vraiment pas loin du métro. Mizi nous a donné une carte de NYC qui nous a bien aidé. Et son mari nous a donné quelques conseils bien utile. Nous recommandons vraiment cette location![QWERTY123]Mizi y su familia fueron muy amables con nosotros; siempre atentos a nuestras necesidades y preguntas. La habitación es cómoda, silenciosa y privada. Muy agradable el lugar y bien ubicado. A un bloque del Central Park y cerca de dos estaciones de Subway. Lo recomendamos.[QWERTY123]Appartement très bien situé à Manhattan juste à côté de central Park et du métro . Des hôtes charmants et très sympathique avec des supers conseils . Nous avons adorés notre semaine à New-York. Merci à eux[QWERTY123]there is no doubt i’ve chosen the right place to stay!

the bedroom is so warm and cozy, you feel like you’re home.
mizi and her husband are so kind and thoughtful, they’ve helped me with lots of doubts and issues.
if i come back here to nyc, i know thats the place im gonna stay for sure.[QWERTY123]L'appartement typique new-yorkais de Stéphanie se situe vraiment à 2 minutes du métro et est très bien desservi. Stéphanie et son mari sont vraiment agréables et vous font partager leur expérience de NY.[QWERTY123]Voici l'adresse qu'il faut connaitre pour se mettre en totale immersion à New-York. L'appartement est décoré avec gout et se situe à deux pas de deux stations de métros. Stéphanie et Abdulaye sont des citoyens du monde, polyglottes et philanthrope. Encore merci à eux pour ce séjour magique.[QWERTY123]Very nice place in good location. Clean and friendly atmosphere. Mizi is very good person and also her family.
Thank you for staying
Barbora[QWERTY123]Les conseils avisés de nos hotes nous ont permis de multiplié les bonnes idées découvertes locales. L'emplacement était parfaits pour nos besoins, proche du métro qui mène au centre Manhattan tout en nous permettant de séjourner dans un quartier typique. Stéphanie et sa famille ont été très chaleureux et accueillant A notre égard. Ils ont été présent et A l écoute de nos besoin. Le séjour dans leur bel appartement à été facile et très agréable. A refaire sans hésitation![QWERTY123]La estadía fue excelente. Mizi es muy atenta y cordial. Esta dispuesta a ayudarte en todo lo que necesites. La ubicación es perfecta, estas a 2 cuadras del central park y tenes subtes y colectivos cerca. Podes llegar a casi cualquier lugar sin problemas y muy rápido. Volvería y recomiendo este lugar :)[QWERTY123]Great location. Central park at 2 minutes walking. Subway  is close to the house. Safe at anytime.
We recommend that place.[QWERTY123]Die Familie mit drei Söhnen lebt in einem großen Appartment, 4. Etage ohne Aufzug, direkt am nördlichen Centralpark (Centralpark North, 110 Str) . Es werden zwei Zimmer vermietet, die sich ein eigenes Bad teilen. Die Zimmer sind jeweils mit einem Stockbett (unten 140 cm, oben 90 cm breit),  Schreibtisch, Kleiderschrank und Sitzecke eingerichtet. AC, Deckenventilator, und sehr schöne Bilder. Küche wird mit der Familie geteilt. Klein, geschmackvoll und sauber. Subway (Linien 1,2,3) und Busse, vegatarisches Restaurant, Wäscherei, Bars, Supermarkt sind nahe bei. Südharlem ist ein Szenekiez mit den bekannten Vor- und Nachteilen. Auf jeden Fall sicher. Mizi gibt eine kompakte Einführung, hält erste Orientierungskarten bereit und ist sehr hilfbereit, Taxi ordern,  ausdrucken. Sehr zu empfehlen.[QWERTY123]La habitación es cómoda y limpia y con suficiente luz, igual las instalaciones de baño están limpias. El subway está a dos cuadras del departamento y Central park también a 2 cuadras. Cerca hay restaurantes donde se come sabroso y con tranquilidad se puede recorrer el barrio. Buena ubicación del lugar y Steph es excelente anfitriona que orienta acerca de las actividades y modo de llegar a los principales lugares.[QWERTY123]So far the best airbnb we have experienced in nyc. Warm welcoming and beautiful house.[QWERTY123]Nous avons adoré séjourner dans l’appartement de Stéphanie. La localisation est idéale, a deux pas des métros, en bordure de central park dans un quartier calme et agréable. L’appartement est très propre et les chambres sont climatisées. Stéphanie et sa famille sont adorables, ils nous ont donné des conseils et nous ont aidé quand nous en avons eu besoin. Je recommande ce logement les yeux fermés.[QWERTY123]Schöne Wohnung in guter Lage direkt am Central Park. Nette und einfache Kommunikation. Absolut empfehlenswert für ein Wochenende in New York![QWERTY123]We had an amazing time in NY C. The place is nice and cozy! Feels like home! Steph always answered quickly and helped us even though we arrived late at night. We speak Spanish and she tried to speak Spanish also so we could understand better. She was very specific about the rules of the house and places we could go to!  It’s well located and the bus stoped near. It’s close to the subway too! We will certainly go back there!![QWERTY123]Very welcoming hosts and nice athmosphere[QWERTY123]Todo bien! Buena ubicación, buen piso[QWERTY123]Très bon accueil. Logement idéalement placé 
De très bons échanges avec notre hôte.[QWERTY123]Steph is a GREAT host, nice and easy to have a conversation with. Me and my friend had a great time in her apartment.[QWERTY123]Très bon séjour chez Stéphanie. Elle nous a attendu jusque 1h du matin pour notre arrivée et nous a donné toutes les informations nécessaires. Stéphanie et sa famille sont très chaleureux. Ils peuvent vous conseiller sur des sorties ou choses à faire. Bonne localisation avec des lignes de métro pas loin qui vont rapidement dans le sud de Manhattan et central park à côté.[QWERTY123]Die Unterkunft entspricht genau der Beschreibung. Hier macht man garantiert nichts falsch. Wir wurden sehr herzlich empfangen und hatten ein tolles Zimmer mit tollen Betten. :-) Wir haben geschlafen wie ein Stein. Steph und ihre Familie sind sehr herzlich. Man fühlt sich einfach willkommen. Die Wohnung ist direkt am Eingang vom Central Park North. Perfekt um den Tag mit einer Radtour o einem Spaziergang zu starten. Die Subway und auch eine Busstation ist gleich um die Ecke und die Gegend ist wirklich sicher. Wir kommen bestimmt nochmal wieder. :-) Danke nochmal an Steph und ihre Familie :-*"	40.79903412423927	-73.95406295429153	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/8225	3	49.0	0.816667
60	20717	"We enjoyed our stay at Guillaume's house a lot. His welcome on the day we arrived and his hospitality during our entire stay were very warm and Guillaume helped us with getting started around the neighborhood. The house is beautiful, clean and spacious. It is at a great location, very central in Brooklyn, near Park Slope and the several subway lines, so it also easy to get to Manhattan from. We highly recommend others to stay here when visiting Brooklyn.[QWERTY123]The location is great, very close to subway stops and walking distance to coffee shops and boutiques on 5th and 7th avenues. 
The room is clean and comfortable with private entrance. I very much enjoyed the garden view from my room.
The hosts were very flexible and extremely helpful with directions around their neighborhood.
I enjoyed my stay and am recommending it if one wants to stay in Brooklyn with easy access to Manhattan.[QWERTY123]Guillaume was an excellent host. We had a late arrival and he patiently waited for us. His home is in a excellent area close to the subway train as well. The private entrance made me feel as though we had our own home. Thanks again Guillaume for being a wonderful host.[QWERTY123]Guillaume is a very pleasant and warm person who is there to help if you need assistance and will leave you alone if that is what you prefer. 

In my opinion the location is excellent, a short train ride to Manhattan on the B,Q or 2,3; also very close to 7th Ave in Park Slope which is a very pleasant commercial thoroughfare. 

The room was in the garden level of the brownstone. Outside the room is a well-equipped kitchen, refrigerator, and a separate dining area which you may share with others as sometimes there are other guests.

[QWERTY123]Guillaume est une personne altruiste. Son accueil était des plus chaleureux et agréable malgré notre arrivée précipitée.
Le logement est confortable, très bien agencé et dispose de nombreux équipements. Parfaitement situé pour découvrir New York, on y retrouve l'âme de Brooklyn.
[QWERTY123]Guillaume was very welcoming and cordial!  We especially liked having a separate entrance to our room.  Also, really appreciated having a clean spotless bathroom.  Having our own kitchen to share with the other renters was a big plus.  Sorry we didn't get to say goodbye, Guillaume, but we left early and didn't want to disturb your morning.  We would love to come back on our next trip![QWERTY123]My stay at this B&B was excellent in many ways. I felt very welcome, the room was lovely, the facilities convenient: the shared kitchen and bathroom were very well equipped. With the subway across the street, many nice local stores, I enjoyed myself here. I especially liked the park, the Brooklyn Museum and Botanical Garden (all walking distance) and not to forget: 7th street, just around the corner, with it's bookshop and flee market on Saturday! A European 'vibe', but still very American: for me, the ideal mix. Thank you Guillaume and Sarah.[QWERTY123]I stayed with Guillaume for the better part of two weeks while looking for more permanent housing, and could not have been happier with his hospitality and the amenities. Guillaume lives in a beautiful brownstone with his wife and daughter, and the rooms rented out to AirBnB guests are on the ground floor with their own separate entrance. Two of the rooms share a bathroom, while the third has a private bathroom attached. The three bedrooms share a charmingly decorated dining area as well as a kitchen that is well-equipped for basic meal preparation. The setup provides a nice opportunity to meet fellow travelers and perhaps share a meal. A housekeeper comes every Friday and does a great job cleaning and tidying up. You have access to WiFi, and are provided with towels and linens. 

The house is ideally located for access to the subway (B/Q right across the street, 2/3 a few blocks away, and every line that runs through Brooklyn other than the G a 10-15 minute walk away at the Atlantic Ave/Barclay Center stop) and some of Brooklyn's loveliest and most interesting neighborhoods. 

Guillaume himself is flexible, helpful and deeply hospitable. I greatly enjoyed chatting with him, and was touched that he made the effort to learn why I was in Brooklyn and provide some house-hunting tips. He has drawn up a map of the area with some of his favorite attractions for his French-speaking guests, and I'm sure would be happy to assist guests with anything else they are hoping to get out of a trip to New York.[QWERTY123]This is the best air bnb I had so far. It's a quite apartment great location with just two minute walk to the best subway station. Guillaume was a wonderful kind host. A++[QWERTY123]Guillaume and Sarah were great hosts. The room is big and clean. Like being in a hotel. Very recommended. I will be back."	40.67831982479	-73.9724261113136	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/20717	2	85.0	0.65
61	20724	"Super nice and cool place![QWERTY123]The reservation was canceled 12 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.[QWERTY123]The apartment was amazing! It is located perfectly in Bushwick close to Williamsburg a lot of cool bars and restaurants. Getting into Manhattan was also really easy. Augustin's roommate were so nice during our stay. Would love to come back![QWERTY123]This is a nice place in a central location in Brooklyn.  Getting around the city is easy because there is a train stop just a couple of blocks away from the house.  Augustin was not in town when my friend and I stayed here, but the roommates were very helpful, and friendly.  They were able to answer questions about getting around, and places to go in the city.  The roommates took us out with them on New Years Eve, and we had a good time.  Everyone living there is either an artist or musician, and they create a nice community.  The house itself has a large communal area, and a large kitchen.  For the most part the house was clean, but like most homes with a few roommates it is not perfectly clean.  The bedroom is large, but has a low ceiling.  There is a dog and a couple of cats, all of which are very friendly.  My friend and I had a great time, and we would def. stay here again.[QWERTY123]Super lovely place - is as exciting-looking as the photos suggest. It's very close to the subway as well, which is useful for getting into Manhattan or elsewhere in Brooklyn. Didn't meet Augustin as he was away but his (Hidden by Airbnb) seemed friendly.[QWERTY123]I had an amazing time in NY and coming home at the end of the night to this chill loft was a major plus. The pictures definitely do the place justice. The roommates in the house were all really nice and welcoming. Nearby delis open late into the night kept me fed. The subway was only a few minutes walk away, so my commute into Manhattan and DUMBO were made really simple.

If you're chill and looking for a cool Brooklyn place, you should be happy with this place.[QWERTY123]Pretty good experience :)[QWERTY123]Augustin's place as totally rad!  Just as cool as the photos.  Great location, comfortable bed.[QWERTY123]Everything was great! Especially Kurt took excellent care of me :-)[QWERTY123]Amazing artsy apartment in my favourite part of Brooklyn. I didn't stay in this room due to a mix up, but I did stay in two different rooms in this place and both were comfortable, big, spacious and perfect for my NYC stay. Would recommend to any one. Conveniently located really close to the Flushing Ave train stop. I would recommend to any one coming to this big city to stay here!![QWERTY123]What's your idea of cool loft in the heart of Brooklyn? Well, this place is exactly What you mean. The room is very spacious, like the living room, where sometimes movies are projected on the wall, the kitchen and the bathroom. All the loft is very sunny and fool of art pieces.  The position is perfect cause the subway stop is at two streets close, so very confortable, with two lines. The roommates are all very kind and helpful And a cool fact is that in every moment of the day there is someone with have a talk. Place super suggested, when I'll return in New York I'll return here for sure![QWERTY123]Great Experience... :)[QWERTY123]The space is in a great location. The warehouse is huge and great to hang out in. The room is not as sunny or as open and clean as the pictures show and the ceiling is actually quite low meaning there is a lot of ducking that needs to be done. But the bed is super comfortable. The check in process was tough as Augustin could not be home till 10pm, he did give us a contact of his housemate who we could contact. We contacted his housemate and left a voicemail, which he did not receive, and then we did not hear anything back from Augustin or his housemate. We arrived leisurely and luckily his housemate had gotten home and was cleaning the room for our arrival.[QWERTY123]I never met the host but his housemate John was a real star, Mark and Kurt were also super helpful. Lots of intelligent conversations around the huge kitchen table, live music and a great atmosphere. This is the neighborhood where Grandmaster Flash roamed in 1977 and the Opening Scene from French Connection ends. It feels more like recognizing than discovering. Great place. If you like interesting people and places, gritty culture and creativity: Go![QWERTY123]Really cool place. Augustin was really very reactive. 
[QWERTY123]Great for Short-term stays.

Great artist loft, with some cool people there.  

However, a couple of the roommates were quite territorial and appeared to be aspiring bullies, completely disrespecting other people's space and items, rather than stating if there was some type of issue.  The fridge was a complete sh*t show, with everyone eating everyone else's food, moving it around, throwing it out, and idk what else - brand new items would completely disappear.  

Basically, a couple of bad apples brought down the ambiance of a great space for everyone else.[QWERTY123]Awesome for a short stay, huge open communal spaces, low ceilings in room and only a canvas as a door to room didn't bug me! Most of the roommates were chill and accommodating, Kurt even helped me bring my huge bag up a few flights of stairs! I did have a couple weird interactions w/ a couple of the roommates when I was taking a few pictures in the awesome space w/ a photographer buddy...perhaps territorial of their home and my towel oddly disappeared from the bathroom. Other than that I enjoyed my stay![QWERTY123]The host canceled this reservation 7 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.[QWERTY123]El sitio es genial y Agustín es muy simpático la casa es mucho mejor de lo que se ve en las fotos y tiene una energía especial, también el barrio es muy peculiar y merece conocerlo un poco.
En resumen el mejor sitio para pasar unos días en NY.[QWERTY123]Had an awesome stay in one of Brooklyn's nicest neighborhoods. The space was amazing and unexpectedly artsy. The roommates were nice, the amenities were clean and easy-to-use."	40.70032104605854	-73.93829583489249	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/20724	1	65.0	0.866667
62	8343	"Nice  and comfortable.  We were 4 and needed 3 bedrooms.  The apartment is spacious and  in a nice low key area.  Lots of good restaurants and very close to Tompkins Sq Park.    Subway reasonably close.  Lori was very good about communicating with us and answered all questions promptly.  Very nice[QWERTY123]My family and I had an amazing stay in Lori's apartment over the new year, 2011/12.  I didn't know the East Village well, but it was great to live in the heart of this up-and-coming neighborhood.  The apartment is situated a few steps from a park and St Mark's Place (a very 'happening' street). The apartment is large by New York standards.  It was clean and in good condition.  It also felt safe an secure.  The kitchen was particularly nice.  It was great to have a big bathroom as well as a smaller 'half-bath'.  There was free WiFi, and a free washing machine in the basement.  Lori was also able to arrange a mid-stay cleaning, which was great for us, with five people using the bathrooms.  Lori was great to deal with and was quick to respond to all of my emails.  I love to spend time in New York and walk everywhere, but some people may find the East Village a little 'under-serviced' by subways.  It's a good 15+ minute walk to the nearest station.  But I would definitely stay here again, and have already recommended it to my friends.  Thanks Lori![QWERTY123]Very comfortable apartment in a great neighborhood! The apt is spacious, clean, quiet, away from street noise. We felt very safe & welcome here. Location a few steps up from street level (in walk-up building) was good for my elderly mother. Excellent communication with host Lori and attention to our particular needs; plenty of clear, helpful instructions. The East Village neighborhood at her doorstep offers lots of restaurants, a couple of groceries & beautiful Tomkins Square Park within very easy walking distance - also several city bus routes. An ideal, friendly base for enjoying the city![QWERTY123]The place is good and well priced. i assumed to feed the cats for a small discount that later regreted to.[QWERTY123]Ficamos muito bem instalados, a proprietaria não estava presente mas esteve sempre pronta  a resolver tudo com muita rapidez por email e telefone, quem nos recebeu foi outra pessoa. Lori, desde o inicio dos contatos, quis saber quantos eramos e quis nos instalar da melhor maneira possivel, o que realmente ocorreu. Ficamos com seus gatos, pois haviamos dito que gostavamos. O apto fica em um bairro tranquilo, perto de um parque e proximo a varios restaurante e uma agitada vida noturna, o que não atrapalha a tranquilidade do apartamento. Fizemos tudo a pé e com metro, sem problemas. Quando voltar a NY certamente gostaria de ficar no apto da Lori que por sinal tem uma energia muito positiva.[QWERTY123]Lori was an absolute pleasure to deal with, she was very welcoming and helpful in every possible aspect. Her home was lovely, very neat and more importantly very comfortable. The surrounding neighborhood was wonderful, with plenty of interesting stores to check out and great restaurants and bars.

All in all, a perfect experience, and I would not hesitate to stay again![QWERTY123]My workmates and I stayed at lori's place for 10 days. The apartment was lovely with plenty of room (although the third bedroom is very small - probably better for a child). It is in a fantastic location - lots of restaurants and bars in the surrounding streets as well as a gorgeous park just across the road. It is also very quiet - we had no problems with sleeping at all.  It was great to come home to such a peaceful place after the hustle and bustle of being out in the city. There were plenty of transport options close by - no more than 10 mins to the subway and a few different buses very nearby. I would highly recommend this apartment if you are looking for a place to stay in NY. We had a great time here.[QWERTY123]In summary - a clean, spacious and brilliantly decorated flat in a convenient and quiet East Village location, with a responsive and friendly hostess.

The flat is in a great location in the East Village, near the famous Katz's Delicatessen and St Mark's place (a street - the heart of the East Village), yet is tucked away in a very quiet street. It is a short walk away from a stop on the grey L metro line, but we walked most of our week in Manhattan.

The flat itself is brilliant - it was unexpectedly spacious! Large dining and lounge room, including a well-stocked and modern kitchen. We hosted dinner twice in the apartment and found it to be perfect.
3 bedrooms with 3 beds each was ideal for myself and 2 other friends to have a bed each.
And two toilets meant no fighting!
Also, just a small but cool thing - Lori has wireless speakers that can play music from an iPhone/iPod - perfect for having music on while in the flat.

Lori (hostess) was very responsive and detailed in her correspondence. Also very flexible in our very late check-in and our check-out.
She made our stay as comfortable as possible!

Thanks for letting us enjoy your apartment for a great week in NYC![QWERTY123]Lori's home was absolutely perfect for our family of four! It was a nice, quiet respite after busy days of touring the city.  It was exactly as Lori represented, and Lori provided a manual of helpful tips for the home and surrounding area. Lori was easy to work with, super responsive, and we would plan to stay in Lori's home again if our travels bring us back to NYC.[QWERTY123]The Apartment was very very clean and big... We had a extraordinary time in New York. Lori was very diligent ensuring all our expectations were meet. It's also very centric good bars and restaurants[QWERTY123]We stayed at Lori's place for 10 days during the end of July. The apartment lies in a great neighbourhood, is spacious, quiet, and stayed comfortably cool despite the summer heat. Our host was very friendly, helpful and accommodating in every regard, with all amenities being provided. In short, it was a great stay. If you want to spend some time in Manhattan, this is definitely a great place to do so.[QWERTY123]Lori answered to all our questions very fast and clearly, Rosa gived us the keys and she tooks the time to speak with us and explain us everything, both are so kind !!
The district is very cute and pretty, there is a big garden just next to the flat ! 
The flat is big and the AC was so pleasant in the flat because it was hot outside. Everything was totally clean and beds are very confortable, definitly, this flat is a perfect place to visit and enjoy NYC !!![QWERTY123]Thank you Lori for opening up your lovely home to my family and friend. Your place was perfect for the location, things to do in the neighborhood.  It truly was a quite getaway and did not seem like we were in the middle of NY city. The layout of your place was so accommodating to many people without feeling cramped, but also a nice living space to share food and company family time. Second bathroom was dreamy. We felt safe in the area and in your place. Your were a doll to leave me messages and I loved the small notes to guide us in the house. Being from Seattle, the little rain we saw did not slow us down. That said, we left two cheap rain coats in case someone could use them. I highly recommend Lori's place to friends and family.❤️"	40.72480817161134	-73.9805652508546	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/8343	7	272.0	1.0
63	20755	"I enjoyed the 2 months I stayed at Erica's house very much. The room was beautiful and very comfortable. I would definitely recommend this place! Thank you, Erica![QWERTY123]When I arrived at Erica's place I was surprised how big and lovely the room was, as places usually are smaller than what they look like on photos - this one wasn't! And it was clean and very cozy. Due to its own bathroom I had a lot of privacy. 
The whole house is a very friendly place with a big kitchen that is well equipped for every purpose. The people who stayed there with me were lovely and helpful and so was Erica herself. Whenever I had a question or problem she was ready to help.
The nearby subway stations made my daily commute to the City easy and it was always good to come home from Manhattan to this nice neighborhood with its little shops and cafes to unwind.
I enjoyed my stay there a lot and would stay there again. I think I was lucky to have found it and can recommend it to everyone who is looking for a place one can feel at home at!
[QWERTY123]Erica has a beautifully maintained brownstone in a very pleasant neighbourhood in Brooklyn - quiet enough to rest, and walking distance to bars, cafes, nightlife, Brooklyn flea. The room is spacious, with plenty of storage, a cute balcony into the yard, and a quirky bathroom (not in a bad way). G train to Williamsburg around the corner, C train to Manhattan a few blocks away.
Erica was very helpful before arrival, with small emergencies during the stay, and hosting a friend over the weekend. The housemates were friendly, and mostly invisible. This is definitely a good place to stay for a longer period of time as well.[QWERTY123]The reservation was canceled 87 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.[QWERTY123]Erica is a terrific person to rent from in every way- She's friendly, warm, welcoming, and highly accommodating. My experience with her has been overwhelmingly positive. Her brownstone building in Brooklyn, where I stayed, was one of the most beautiful houses I've ever had the pleasure of staying in, inside and out. My experience with Erica is that she goes above and beyond to create an amazing experience to anyone staying in her place. Having stayed in many AirBnB places over the years, I can say that Erica's place is by far the best and most comfortable experience I've had. Highly recommended.[QWERTY123]Erica was a really great host! She answered promptly and was very accommodating with our early arrival (let us keep our bags at the apartment).  
The place was lovely and looked even nicer than the pictures.  There was tons of space and the washroom is very cool! The room was clean and the bed was comfy.  All of the amenities were provided for (hairdryer, towels, ironing board, shampoo/conditioner).  
The neighbourhood is amazing and is filled with beautiful Brownstones! Blocks away from parks, cafes, restaurants and a subway line to Manhattan.  Would definitely recommend staying here.[QWERTY123]Clinton Washington is really nice and quiet, the room is extremely spacious and confortable, the washroom great, Too bad the place is rather dark and lacks intimacy because of the sliding glass doors. Otherwise, the big kitchen that has everything you need to cook, and is a nice place for meeting other guests in the house which were all super friendly.[QWERTY123]The house is gorgeous. The room is very large and you have your own bathroom and access to a very large kitchen right across from the room. Erica is an incredibly sweet person and always willing to help. The apartment has great access to the C train. It was 25 minutes door to door on my commute to work on Wall Street.  Also the G is even closer and gets you around brooklyn. Highly recommend this place![QWERTY123]Erica's place is beautiful and quiet, in a quintessential Brooklyn brownstone on a tree-lined street in a great neighborhood. And the shower is great. As a host, Erica was very communicative and responsive.[QWERTY123]Great stay - super convenient location and the room was big and comfortable.[QWERTY123]The location was ideal for us. Good street and only half a block from the Pratt Institute Architecture School. It's also an easy walk to stores and restaurants on Myrtle and a 20 minute walk to downtown Brooklyn. Subway access to Manhattan and other the boroughs is also very close. 

We were expecting a warm and eclectic vintage home, as depicted in the photos and description. Unfortunately the property has not been well maintained and does not come close to the promised experience. While Erica was accessible, via text, and made our arrival experience easy, she appears to have neglected the property which now needs a major cleanliness and appearance overhaul. 

We had planned on two nights there and only stayed one - it was late when we arrived so we slept there, otherwise we would have not even stayed. 

Given a thorough cleaning, a few repairs and some accessories to warm up the place, it would easily live up to the promised charming, landmark building. And provided those things were done, we would consider staying there again.[QWERTY123]Erica’s place was great, exactly as described and she provided nice extras like towels, shampoo and soap. The location is also great, right beside the subway in a lovely neighbourhood.[QWERTY123]Erica’s place was really nice. The brownstone is amazing. Erica is also very nice. There was an issue with ants in the bathroom and kitchen one day, maybe because of the warming weather. Not sure if that’s a regular issue or not. Other than that the place was really nice and far bigger and more private than most private rooms you will find. Thank you Erica."	40.68634255283465	-73.96599634891996	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/20755	3	98.0	0.82
64	20853	"tracy's home is a lovely, light-filled, quiet oasis in the heart of brooklyn. i rented his space for work, and took it for the living room, bath tub, and garden. but there's so much more to enjoy! he left a note detailing all of the information about the apartment, and though we didn't meet in person, he seems to mirror his apt-lovely and warm!.
i'd stay here again in a heartbeat, and hope to someday soon. i already miss the light![QWERTY123]This is an incredible house in a beautiful and accessible neighborhood in Brooklyn. Close to the Atlantic Terminal, which connects with Manhattan and the rest of Brooklyn, it was a great base for our stay. We stayed for two months, the house is beautiful, has a large back yard, all modern appliances, nice big bath, heating and the neighbors are friendly. Definitely a great place to stay.[QWERTY123]We felt very welcome and comfortable in Tracy's brownstone. The listing description was very accurate and he had gone to a lot of effort to make the space ready for us. We stayed for over 3 months (2 adults and a toddler) and there was ample closet and cupboard space for us to use. The location is very convenient, especially the variety of train lines at Barclay's Centre. Being able to use the garden and BBQ was a lovely bonus. We had one small maintenance issue that was dealt with promptly and effectively - although Tracy himself was overseas, he had a friend locally who was able to provide assistance straight away. Communication with Tracy was easy and clear.  One thing I will note is that the smaller front room does face Dean St, which is a popular route for fire trucks - if you plan to have a child or light sleeper in that room, just be aware! Our son was woken a few times, but it wasn't a major issue (he loved sitting on the stoop to watch the fire trucks too!). We are happy to recommend Tracy as a host and his listing as a very comfortable place to stay.[QWERTY123]We absolutely loved the place. Amazing neighborhood, beautifully furnished. There's a huge bathtub downstairs. Can't do much better than this flat.[QWERTY123]Tracy was a fantastic host. He was very flexible with our arrival time which was greatly appreciated. He was only a phone call away if we needed him. 
The house is fantastic. There was plenty of room for the family of 4. It is close to the train , shops and plenty of lovely restaurants and boutique bars . The area is sensational with a family feel. We were lucky to be there during a street party which added to the community atmosphere. 
Prospect Park is in walking distance and we enjoyed spending time there. 
While we enjoyed Manhattan , we loved  coming back to Brooklyn in the evenings and would definitely stay there again. 
A big Thankyou to Tracy for making our first Airbnb experience so good.[QWERTY123]We stayed at Tracy’s place for a month, and enjoyed our stay immensely.  We were doing a reno of our home in Brooklyn, and the completion was delayed by a month, so we needed another place to stay.  After being out for several months already, we wanted to be nowhere but back in our home.  But Tracy’s home quickly made us forget the discomfort of being displaced.  (There were three of us – me, my wife and my 16-year-old daughter.) From our first interaction with Tracy, he was gracious and friendly.  He provided detailed information on the house, neighborhood and transit.  The living room/kitchen area has large windows which flood the house with welcome light during the day (and overlooking his welcoming backyard with its grill and hammock.) The master bedroom is ample, with a beautifully finished bathroom including a large bathtub.  Neighborhood restaurant options are plentiful, and the nearby Atlantic Ave/Barclays train station has most subway lines to the city, as well as the LIRR.  When the end of the month came and it was time for us to move back into our own home, we were thrilled, but also a touch sad that our stay in this lovely home was coming to an end. We can’t recommend it enough.[QWERTY123]We rented this apartment for my in-laws who were staying in Brooklyn for a month in January 2017.  Tracy was great about reaching out ahead of time for the key drop-off and during their visit to make sure they were settled and had what they needed.  The apartment is really beautiful and our parents were very comfortable for their stay.  Here's what my mother-in-law had to say!:  
""Double thumbs up for our stay in Tracy Collins' home!  The most impressive fact is how spacious and well maintained the apartment is.  It was very clean and ready for guests.  The natural lighting was a great feature with very large ceiling to floor windows.  Location was a plus as the apt was between Flatbush & Vanderbilt Avenues -  close to lots of shopping, grocery stores, Prospect Park, & great restaurants.  Mr. Collins was readily available via phone or text.  He was courteous, friendly, and always responded in a timely manner.  Yes, if I was in Brooklyn I would be pleased to stay in Tracy's home again. ""[QWERTY123]We were hosted by Tracy for three weeks in his beautiful and comfortable place. Tracy was very kind, reliable, and generous providing us with good wine, beer, coffee, and breakfast at our arrival. The neighbourhood is beautiful, quiet, and very safe and the house is 5 minutes walk from very well connected train stations.
For some days we were also able to fit very comfortably in four people because the house is large, there are 2 comfortable bedrooms with three bathrooms on two different levels. The house was very clean and bright. The kitchen was beautiful and completely furnished. We didn’t use the washing machine, however the laundry was very close. The wifi connection was very fast and reliable. The projector was incredible and allowed us to watch movies with the computer connection on a very big and comfortable sofa! 
To summarize I really recommend this place.[QWERTY123]Tracy is a great host and his house is perfect, its comfortable with a very well equipped kitchen and he even left us a beautiful hamper full of delicious snacks apon arrival  - we wanted for nothing - everything was easy to find/use, he left a wonderful list of instructions and suggestions of places to eat. The beds and bedding are very comfortable, the garden is so beautiful and we really enjoyed sitting out there. The location is great - very easy to get around with the subway or we also used the lyft app that tracy recommended. The area it self was lovely and was easy to navigate walking around to all the surrounding areas we didn't come across one rude person - everyone was so helpful. Traceys neighbors are lovely and helped us out a few times. We really enjoyed our stay.[QWERTY123]We had a great stay here! Very easy to get anything you need as there's a stop n shop and target within a couple blocks. Also great little restaurants and shops all along Vanderbilt and Flatbush streets. 

Tracy was very welcoming and helpful. Loved the birds chirping outside who live in the big pretty tree in the back courtyard.


[QWERTY123]Tracy's place is located in center of Brooklyn. Location is perfect for traveling to Manhattan by express line it takes only 15 minutes. Tracy answered all our questions really quick and specific. Place itself is amazing. It's spacious, bright and perfect for longer stay. You really can feel there at home. Our host left us great assortment of snacks and coffee and also fully equipped kitchen. We had a great experience and it was perfect for our first time in New York.[QWERTY123]Maison très agréable meublée avec goût, pièces lumineuses, parfait pour une famille ( grande salle de bain 2 douches, 1 baignoire et 3 wc ) : on s'y sent comme chez soi. Tracy note hôte est disponible et très sympathique : excellent acceuil. Emplacement idéal à Brooklyn à proximité de métros qui desservent tous les quartiers de New York. Nous avons passé 14 jours fabuleux. Nous recommandons très fortement cet hébergement. Famille GAINET -FRANCE.[QWERTY123]My family and I have lived solely in airbnb's the last 2.5 years and I have to say that we had the best experience with Tracy and his wonderful home. We only wish we could have stayed longer!
This brownstone is incredibly spacious, filled with natural light, with high ceilings, 2.5 baths, laundry and a beautiful large private outdoor space (with a grille)! All of which are extremely difficult to find in New York. The space was perfect for our family of three but it would definitely work for two couples or a family of four as well. Also, One of the best things about this brownstone is its location. We fell in love with the neighborhood (which is technically Prospect heights but bordering park slope and crown heights) and how much there is to do especially with young children. There is a playground right across the street and multiple play spaces in walking distance. Or you can hope on the bus right outside the house and go to the BK Children's Museum, prospect park zoo, Brooklyn Museum of art, farmers market at grand army plaza, or multiple yoga studios holding kids classes. There are great restaurants, gyms, and a target literally around the corner. And of course Barclays literally down the street which contains one of the busiest MTA stations with almost every single line... VERY convenient. My husband commuted on the Q every day to Union Square which is only 3 stops away and door to door took just 30 minutes. I just can't rave enough! 
 
Tracy was a wonderful host, greeting us upon arrival, helping us move in, and even leaving a gift basket filled with local artisan goodies. He answered every question I had in a timely fashion and was very pleasant while doing so.

I highly recommend Tracy's home for a family a group that wants to explore this area of brooklyn and get a real sense of what it's like to live there while also staying in a beautiful spacious home.[QWERTY123]We travelled from Sydney to spend 2 weeks in New York and Tracy’s home in Brooklyn was perfect for us - 2 adults and our teenage daughter - Tracy’s home is so convenient to the subway - shopping and great local restaurants and walks - we felt very safe in the area and loved our stay - we would highly recommend staying in Tracy’s home - it is extremely comfortable and suited our needs perfectly.[QWERTY123]This apartment was just as described and as represented in photos.  It was perfect for our family (3) holiday.  We spent Xmas and New Year here  and a couple of significant birthdays.  We will have many fond memories of family celebrations here.  It was the perfect location to return to after days trekking around discovering the delights of Brooklyn neighbourhoods or venturing in to Manhattan. The proximity to a variety of subway options was a definite plus.  On down days when we just wanted to chill the apartment provided us with a warm environment within which to read, listen to music or watch movies.  Tracy provided great tips and tricks on restaurants and other services within the locale.  He was there on our arrival to welcome us and take us through the apartment explaining how everything worked.  We highly recommend a stay at Tracy’s apartment.[QWERTY123]We stayed at Tracey's place for two weeks. Our party consisted of two older adult couples.   Tracy was there to welcome us and show us around.  As well, he left a long list of tips which we found very helpful.  Tracy's place was a home away from home;     very comfortable and clean. It was conveniently located close to transport,  shops and restaurants. We certainly would  recommend Tracy's home  to other travellersl[QWERTY123]Nice apartment in a nice area. Tracy is a very friendly host. I definitely recommend this place."	40.680350549009596	-73.97162151058627	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/20853	4	250.0	0.866667
65	8505	Greg has a wonderful apartment in the Windsor Terrace Neighborhood of Brooklyn. The apartment is located in a lovely residential neighborhood directly across from Prospect Park and close to two local commercial areas with plenty of restaurants and other amenities. The room is clean and comfortable. The apartment has recently been refurbished with a new kitchen and bathrooms. Greg is a great communicator, hospital host, and was very accommodating with our particular needs. Highly recommend![QWERTY123]Beautiful apartment in a great location right across from Prospect Park and close to restaurants and shopping.  The kitchen and bathroom were recently redone and are sparkling. Greg was a responsive and considerate host. Highly recommend![QWERTY123]Just fabulous ![QWERTY123]Beautifully renovated apartment, good location, clean. Greg was a great host.[QWERTY123]Great location, host, accommodation[QWERTY123]Greg's place worked great for my stay in NYC for work-nice location (Prospect Park and nice area), 40 or so minutes total to Lower Manhattan (via the R), nice place, small building, comfortable bed (firm) with nice sheets and towels. Greg was communicative and nice to interact with. Would absolutely stay here again.[QWERTY123]Very nice clean room. Easy street parking.[QWERTY123]Great location in Brooklyn, next to prospect park, Windsor terrace[QWERTY123]Best place i stayed at yet  in NY, amazing location. Thanks again Greg![QWERTY123]Staying at Greg's was great. The place is very clean, the room is nice and sunny, and you're across the street from Prospect Park! So long as you're not looking for a place where you can cook or prepare meals, I highly recommend this![QWERTY123]Greg's place was just what we needed! We were in the city to see family and his place was within walking distance, right on the park, clean and very quiet. Greg was very communicative and flexible when our check in time changed. The only downside is that you can't use the common space or kitchen but that's clear before you get there and didn't matter to us! We will definitely be back when we are in the city![QWERTY123]Quiet place in a beautiful area of Brooklyn. I didn't meet Greg during my stay, but he took great care to communicate everything I needed to know, and I was very comfortable.[QWERTY123]Have stayed here previously for work and would stay at Greg's place again.	40.656098903695856	-73.97394715335832	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/8505	2	60.0	0.722222
66	20913	"Christiana has a comfortable 1-bedroom in south Williamsburg, convenient to the Marcy JMZ stop and not far from the Bedford L. It's a good base to explore Williamsburg and Brooklyn and New York, and Christiana's a fantastic host - very welcoming, takes care of all needs and necessities, and is as nice as can be.[QWERTY123]Christiana was a gracious hostess. Although we didn't have the pleasure of meeting her,  she always made time to make sure that our stay went smoothly. The apartment was perfect for our 5 days of transition in NYC. The location is literally 2 minutes from the subway. Getting into Manhattan wasn't a problem. Thank you Christiana for making our stay a pleasant one![QWERTY123]Always available to provide assistance, Christiana was always a phone call or email away to help me during my time in Brooklyn.  The apartment was right next to the subway station and just a few minute train-ride from the city.  Strongly recommand a stay at her place.  Thx much C![QWERTY123]Christiana was an amazing host! She made us feel right at home and was very helpful answering all our questions about NYC. I would definitely recommend her place if you're looking for a great place to stay during your trip. Thanks again, Christiana![QWERTY123]Stayed in Christiana's apartment for a few nights In early Jan, 2011.  Christiana is a very thoughtful host and was very responsive to my questions.  Before departing for NY, Christiana was considerate enough to call to discuss key pick up and other details.  She even offered to pick up my preferred brand of soap for my stay!

The apartment is very cozy, ideal for singles or a couple.  There is one small bedroom, one small living room (with table and 2 chairs), kitchen and a small bathroom.  We were 2 ladies staying in the apartment and felt very safe in the neighborhood, even late at night .  The location is also very convenient, ~4 min walk to Marcy subway (J, M) station and around 10-15mins to the bars, restaurant and nightlife in Williamsburg.  It was very cold outside but the radiators inside the apartment did their jobs very well.

I would recommend Christiana's apartment to couples or singles that are visiting NYC and want reasonably priced accommodation that is close to downtown Manhattan, and is cheaper and larger than a 3* hotel room.  Very close to Laguardia airport, around 15-20mins in cab.[QWERTY123]This is such a  great apartment for the laid back NYC traveler! Located perfectly, all features you need (you don't need a TV..) and a perfectly organized host. Highly recommended!
[QWERTY123]We absolutely fell in love with Christiana's 'bohemian-sheek' apartment. It was a lovely place to call home for our short visit to New York, and it really is in such a great location. So easy to catch the subway, and a short walk to Bedford Ave, lined with quirky bars and restaurants and vintage stores etc. The apartment was very comfortable, great for cooking meals and relaxing to her vinyls. Thanks for everything Christiana![QWERTY123]The apartment is in a good location for visiting Manhattan which is only 2 stops on the JM or Z line from Marcy Ave station which is only a short walk away.

The apartment was perfect for my needs.  I was travelling alone but the apartment would would be fine for two people.

Shops for basic food shopping are just a few minutes walk away with Bedford Avenue around 15 minutes walk away.

I'd be happy to stay again[QWERTY123]Christiana's place is great!  Its very clean and tidy and in a super convenient location.  Highly recommended![QWERTY123]I stayed at Christiana's place from June 14-18, 2011. All  went without  a hitch. Handing over the keys went smoothly and presto, I was in my new digs. Coffee and snacks were left over so I was all set from the get go.

The subway is just a five minute walk away. Small grocery stores are minutes away too. It is a residential neighborhood and finding parking was remarkably easy. The neighborhood is an Orthodox Jewish enclave. 

There was plenty of hot water, the stove was fine, and importantly the wireless connection was good.  However no TV , fans, or air conditioning. The apartment is very cozy but hasn't been updated in ages. No big deal for me since everything that I required worked, and that was exactly what I wanted. 

Never met Christiana but she was always available via text/phone/email. Having an attentive host was far more important to me than whether the digs had been renovated.recently. But all was clean, no bed bugs, and I felt  that it was MY home for five days. 

The neighborhood is safe and I walked home alone from the subway at 1 AM.  You can ride the ""M"" line directly to the Museum  of Modern Art. Other sites are just a transfer away. But be sure to cross Broadway to reach the Manhattan bound trains. I got on the wrong platform and had to pay again to cross over. That's very unusual since
normally you cross for free. But this is an outdoor station.

My daughter lives just 25 minutes away in trendy Williamsburg by foot. That was the main reason I chose 204 Ross. However, the location is a perfect launch point for metro NYC.  If you want your very own private one bedroom apartment, I strongly recommend Christiana's place.[QWERTY123]We used the flat as a great starting off point to explore Williamsburg - the neighbourhood felt very safe and was great to get into manhattan and W-burg from, but was still out of the hustle and bustle.  It definately felt like our own apartment for the week and we had enough space for three of us.[QWERTY123]Christiana's place was perfect for 2 people and really conveniently located for both Brooklyn and Manhatten. Christiana was also a perfect host and responded to all my questions while I was there and I loved her decor.
The street outside was a little noisy in the morning but I guess that means its perfect for people who don't stay out late;)[QWERTY123]We had a great stay in Christiana's apartment from Aug 6-13. The location was excellent and was only a 3-5 minute walk to the Marcy Ave. station that is 1 stop away from the lower east side of Manhattan. We definitely got our money's worth one-week unlimited Metropass. A cab ride from LaGuardia cost us $25. 

The neighborhood was pretty quiet and felt relatively safe amongst the many Hasidic Jews who live nearby. We came back well past midnight on the subway several times and didn't feel unsafe.

The place was a bit smaller than I expected from the pictures, but was still enough for two people. The bedroom fits only a full/queen bed and a few feet of space from the closet. The bathroom is small and has a tiny sink with not great ventilation. We encountered a few roaches in the bathroom, but there was bug spray there to help ward them off. The living room was a decent size and was a comfortable place to relax after a long day exploring the city. The kitchen is definitely suitable for cooking a meal, but there isn't much counter space and no microwave for reheating leftovers easily. The only thing I should have paid closer attention to in the listing description was that her apartment does not have air conditioning, which led to really warm nights when we stayed there. However, she did provide a fan right next to the bed, which helped a lot. Also, the internet connection was fast and reliable.[QWERTY123]only one word: perfect[QWERTY123]My wife and I stayed for 4 nights in Christiana's apartment. We were very pleased with it - nice and cosy, in a great neighborhood and close to the subway. 
We never met Christiana but had good contact with her via mail and phone.[QWERTY123]I never had a chance to meet Christiana because our scheduled differed however she left the key for me downstairs and when I arrived at the apartment it was exactly as she said it was. I had a car so it was very convenient location. The Apartment was very spacious. Clean. Towels available. I would stay here again if ever in the area again. 
[QWERTY123]This was the perfect location for us.  It was quiet, safe, convenient to the subway, we were able to park FREE on the street, and the apartment itself was very comfortable.  We cooked, slept well, had internet access, and were happy to come ""home"" to it in the evening.  Christiana was the ideal host and the apartment was very clean.  We hope to come back.[QWERTY123]I had high hopes for this place but there's no way to tell how the bed feels through pictures. The mattress, unfortunately, was really uncomfortable and felt as if the springs were coming through the mattress. Collectively the rest of the place was fine but there was definitely not enough hot water for 2 people to take a shower. The neighborhood, even by city standards, was quite noisy. I don't mean to be over-critical but it was not exactly what we were expecting although the price was right for budget-conscience people.[QWERTY123]Christiana's flat was in a lovely location in Brooklyn. Marcy Ave is literally a 5 min subway ride into Manhattan. The skyline every morning coming into the city was breath taking. For this reason I would highly recommend staying in Brooklyn. It's such an interesting location compared to most and great for all those wonderful coffee bars!!! :)
Christiana's flat was smaller than the pictures made out but nether the less we felt safe. The bed was incredibly comfortable and fresh towels were waiting for us on our arrival.
Only let down??? The bathtub had little bugs in it every morning - not sure where those came from??? and the water took a while to heat up.
Apart from this, we very much enjoyed our time there.[QWERTY123]Christiana's place is quaint and comfortable. It is quiet and I loved that it was close to the metro for easy access into Manhattan. It was easy to find and Christiana was easy to get ahold of.[QWERTY123]We recently stayed at Christina's apartment for 3 days and had a great time. We never met her but all of her instructions were perfect, from best directions from JFK to finding the keys.  

The neighborhood is very safe and we often walked around very late at night without hesitation. The apartment is centrally located - around the corner from the subway and a nice walk to Bedford & S. 4th St. which is the starting point of a vibrant neighborhood filled with restaurant/bars, coffee shops, large grocery store and lots of fun boutiques - you could explore for days.  

We didn't spend much time in the apartment. We would come home at night and spend a little time on the computer (we were able to link in on Christina's internet with no problems) and go to bed. We'd get up early and wasted no time to be on our way to another new adventure!  There was plenty of hot water for showers (for two) and overall, our stay at Christina's was enjoyable, convenient and a good value.

Thanks Christina![QWERTY123]Christana's place was exactly as advertised. It was cosy, clean & comfortable. The bed was super comfy, the kitchen was neat and tidy and the livingroom was nice and spacious. I didn't get to meet Christiana but, judging by this appartment, she's a very nice and interesting person. It was a great location too, for my first few nights in NYC. 2 minute walk to Marcy Ave station, shops on Broadway and only a 5-10 min walk to the great cafes and shops on Bedford. 
Thanks Christiana![QWERTY123]we´ve been there for one week. pleasure to stay in her apartment. perfect location 5 min to subay and 24/7 shops. nice and quite neighborhood. 
flat has everything you need (fridge, oven and clean bathroom) wifi is fast and stable
we can recommend it for everyone who wants to have nice days in the big apple
[QWERTY123]I loved Christiana's cozy and warm apartment. It's so close to the subway. It's also close the Marlowe and Sons, where you can get the best scones with jam and cream and some mocha, and the Post Office, a favorite of my sons- best chicken liver and bacon sandwiches ever. It was the best sublet I've ever had in Brooklyn, and was so easy to set up. Thank you Christiana for making my vacation so special and so easy.[QWERTY123]I loved it!  It was just right for me....Small, quaint and comfortable.  The location is great and easily accessible.  I found my way around the hood and managed to find some great coffee shops and restaurants.  It was a short commute to Manhattan and I even found my way to EWR! Thanks Christiana!  I'll be back.[QWERTY123]The flat was as we expected, cozy and well located. Christiana has been very kind too. I recommend it![QWERTY123]Nice place, cheap and cheerful.
Don't expect a 5 star hotel, but it's certainly cozy, quiet and the location makes it easy to get around the city.
Christiana was polite and helpful and we had a nice stay here.[QWERTY123]My girlfriend and I stayed in Christiana's apartment for 5 nights recently. Our stay was great. Just as her description says, the location is PERFECT. If you're looking to stay in Brooklyn, or trying to save some money from staying in Manhattan, there's no better place to be than by the Marcy JMZ station. It's easy to get anywhere in Manhattan and seemed like a very safe place. The apartment itself was nice and clean. Our only complaint was the bed and bathroom. The bed isn't the comfiest thing in the world, and the pressure/temperature in the shower is a little finicky, but all things considered, this is a small price to pay. The place is great and I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again.  Especially if you're just looking for a place to crash while you're out exploring the city all day.[QWERTY123]As advertised the place is cozy, clean & tidy, and well located. It's relatively quiet, and close to everything. Christiana made it very easy to check-in and out of the apartment.[QWERTY123]We stayed at Christiana's place for three nights because we were in town for a tournament that was about 5 blocks away.  We really enjoyed her place as well as the surrounding area.  We had no problems finding food or things to do and felt safe at all times.  One word of advice, all of the close proximity stores are closed for the Sabbath, so you should do all of your shopping for necessities on Friday.[QWERTY123]We had a great time in Christiana´s place. It´s perfectly located very close (5 minutes walk) to Bedford avenue, the main hipster street in w-burg.  Nice bars, 2cnd hand shops and cafees everywhere! Two minutes walk to nearest subway station and subway to Manhattan takes 5 minutes. Christiana has been helpfull and when we had any question about things in the apartment she answered our emails within 30 minutes.[QWERTY123]Great place to stay in Brooklyn. Extremely close to the J,M,Z and just a short walk to the G, which made getting around really easy. Very clean when it was hot the fan was a big help! Thanks for the stay, Christiana!![QWERTY123]Extremely easy to get to. Great area. Great price. Eccentric and fun place. Very clean.
Very easy to organize key pick up/drop off. If you stay here it will be really nice for a couple or single person.
Small cons: Bed is a little springy but is overall comfortable, the sheets were great and made it more comfortable than most beds to sleep in, in the summer.
[QWERTY123]Just as advertised, loads of character, we felt like we were staying over at our stylish bohemian friend's house while she was out of town.  

It may not be in the ""heart of it all,"" but the neighborhood was safe, charming, one train stop away from Manhattan, and felt like authentic Brooklyn.  

Great value, no disappointments.  I look forward to staying at Christiana's place again.[QWERTY123]Very good location and over all a nice apartment.[QWERTY123]Very convenient location and despite the proximity of the BQE not noisy at all. The place has a nice bohemian feel to it. Some might find the lack of an A/C or TV bothersome, I didn't mind.[QWERTY123]Christiana's apartment is in a great location in Brooklyn--one stop outside of Manhattan, easy access to Marcy station for the J and M trains (about a 3 minute walk away).  Our host was out of town already but provided detailed instructions that made it super easy to get to the apartment from the airport, into the building and find our way around the neighbourhood.  Thanks, Christiana![QWERTY123]We had a GREAT time at Christiana's place, the location really is perfect for anyone who wants to be close to Manhattan but away from the claustrophobia of the inner city - plus the neighbourhood is very quaint and we (3 girls) felt very, very safe there even coming home late at night. 

The apartment itself is adorable, and although if there's more than two of you someone has to sleep on the couch it's very comfortable if you're petite like me! 

We were just so grateful to have a place like Christiana's to crash at at the end of the day rather than a motel room, it made us feel very much like we were living there rather than just staying temporarily and it just made our New York experience so much better.[QWERTY123]Great location! easy access to Manhattan, to and from the airport, and if you want to wander round Brooklyn's neighborhood by foot it's a great starting point!  Cute apartment with character. Christiana was extremely helpful in giving us all details we needed for our stay, everything was simple and easy so we could enjoy our time. Thanks Christiana![QWERTY123]Christiana's apartment is a great value, very close to everything you need and only one stop over the bridge on the train![QWERTY123]I booked the appartmen for my sister in law and her husband and they really enjoyed there stay. The appartment has everything you need if you want to  have some wonderful days in New York.
Check-In and out was very easy and flexible. Thanki you very much![QWERTY123]Very good experience at Christiana's apartment!
That was clean and comfortable for 3 people. The location is convenient, you're in Manhattan in 15 minutes or so![QWERTY123]Petite but perfectly formed apartment in a really safe, nice part of Brooklyn. So easy to get into Manhattan on the subway (10 -15 mins) and to the best parts of Brooklyn too. Really liked the apartment's character - it's perfect for a couple or solo traveller. Highly recommended.[QWERTY123]Great apartment, close to the subway and food. I was with two other friends and Christiana's place was the perfect size. She also left helpful hints for calling taxis and getting to the airport. Thanks Christiana![QWERTY123]this older style, bohemian apartment was in the perfect location for us, close to bedford, the subway and other amenities. cristiana was easy to communicate and very friendly, leaving us with helpful instructions on how to get around the place. the location is really the key to this place, walking over the williamsburg bridge into manhattan took no time at all.  getting in and out of manhattan was no issue at any time of day or night. as mentioned it is a bit older, so the plumbing was a bit temperamental (especially the shower) but overall not a major hinderance on the stay. the street was quite busy so i wouldn't stay here if you are sensitive to noise, but you'll never find a super quiet street in this city! would definitely consider staying again.[QWERTY123]Christiana's apartment feels like a very authentic NYC place! It's a good neighbourhood very close to the subway into the city. Our only complaint was the bedroom got pretty stuffy at night but other then that we had a great time.[QWERTY123]Christiana's apartment is indeed in a perfect location, close to Manhattan and to all the good spots in Williamsburg! The apartment has everything you need for a visit to NYC. Christiana is a friendly host and very easy to communicate with, when we arrived she informed us that we did not have internet access but she tried to fix it as fast as she could. The apartment has everything you need for a visit to NYC. We only recommend that the place is better cleaned, if you are staying for just a couple of days it would be fine but if you are there for 10 days, like we were, it would be nice if it was better cleaned. But maybe that's just NYC. Staying in Christiana's apartment gave us a good 'feel' of the city life and its inhabitants.[QWERTY123]I'll start by saying that I arrived in NYC just days after Sandy & Christiana admitted she had been set back a little bit by the storm. So I don't know if conditions in the apartment are normally different. Christiana is a super responsive host-- she answered every question I had within minutes-- via text or email. She even called before I arrived when I expressed worry over Sandy and whether things were back to normal in NYC. She is very kind, polite and accommodating.
So first thing: Location is indeed perfect as advertised. Just steps to Marcy JMZ station and minutes to Manhattan! I was worried about this seeing as though I was coming to town for a gig on 42nd street. I never had a problem with transit and the area around the apartment is super safe. We were 2 girls. Felt safe at all times.
Check in and check out: super easy
In terms of cleanliness, this is where my experience shifts. I have such a hard time saying it because Christiana was so nice! Maybe for a short term stay, it wouldn't matter-- but we stayed 2 weeks and the conditions were difficult. I don't know if ""cleanliness"" is culturally subjective because so many of the reviewers made a point to say how clean the place is. I don't know what clean means to you people! I'm happy the last reviewer finally said ""could be better cleaned"". I found the place to be dusty and cluttered, with random things like a crushed carton of cigarettes falling out of the couch (maybe a past tenant?). I felt so uncomfortable I finally swept and mopped the floor-- and the resulting rag come out black as night, much dirt was swept, etc.
Then there's the bugs. Yes, as another reviewer wrote: bugs in the tub every morning. I was hearing constant scuttering and scurrying around the apartment and thought I was crazy at first. If I got up in the middle of the night for a glass of water, I'd see something scamper away when I reached for a glass. Then, I finally saw them: roaches and other critters. Yes, Christiana had left bug spray and when I panic-texted her she told me this is normal in NY. I feel like that might be an exaggeration. Normal? Really? Everyone in NY has roaches running around their kitchen counter? I'll admit, I put fruit on the counter in my first few days (completely un-problematic in Montreal where I live). I remedied that very quickly when I noticed the ""problem"", but it didn't help much. Also, there was the pitter patter of little roach feet in the bedroom where no food had ever been brought.
All in all, I don't mean to disparage such a quaint little apartment at such a reasonable price by NY standards. This place would be 100% perfect with a good cleaning and if the landlord fixed all the cracks, crevices and replaced old rusty things.

[QWERTY123]Christiana's apartment felt like a magical little hub in the middle of Williamsburg. The decor is charming and her taste is lovely--pretty art, a record player, and lots of alluring trinkets line the shelves. Waking up in the comfy bed facing a huge mirror in the morning was perfect. She was easy to work with and very quick with responses to our questions. The neighborhood is pleasant--very Jewish and added to the charm of the entire stay.[QWERTY123]This was my second stay in Christiana apartment.  That says it
all. I will always rent her place when I am in New York. I'm not
done eating in all the little restaurants in the area, or
laying on the couch and reading a book, or popping into
Manhattan on the J.[QWERTY123]Christiana is a great landlord, uncomplicated and super helpful. If you long for the intimacy of a private flat despite being on a budget, you should consider this appartment.  it is very charming, and the perfect base camp for exploring Brooklyn and Manhattan!
The limited space is challening for 3 adults specifically beeing around 5'10.
[QWERTY123]Christiana was a doll. Everything went smooth and she was very kind and helpful. Her apartment was warm, cozy, and her bed was very comfortable on cold snowy nights.[QWERTY123]The apartment has lots of character. Very close to train station. very comfortable.[QWERTY123]Christiana's flat is perfectly located and she is a great host,  extremely respnsive when contacted and flexible.[QWERTY123]Such a pleasant stay at this apt in a great area! Christiana was so nice and informative. I would definitely stay here again! Perfect for a last minute escape for the weekend if you love the city[QWERTY123]This place is a dump. No one ster!!!

 

Good offer if you only go for a convenient location (5 minutes walk from metro station, 1 stop to Manhattan) and a low price. Apart from that it is a place from hell.

Apartment: The place itself is disgusting. Looks like it has never been cleaned and  is packed with dirty clutter and dust. Comes with useful cans of insect poison to kill the cockroaches but with kitchenware for one person. We met the neighbor next door whose kindness didn’t impress us. We however were impressed by our ability to destroy his ceiling in one day (as he told us). We also got harassed by the landlady who called because we were making music (no idea how). We also got a surprise from her afterwards when we were accused of braking kitchenware.

Location: Very messy neighborhood. We heard shots at night and would nobody advice to walk there at night.

Conclusion: skip this one!

[QWERTY123]Christina's place was super cute and bright and near some of our favorite spots in Brooklyn.  I would definitely stay at her place again![QWERTY123]Great location, williamsburg is amazing, very inspirational. Excellent  communication with Christiana the host. New York we love you!![QWERTY123]We were at Christiana's place for a long spring weekend. Everything went well. The location is very convenient : metroline M & J to Manhattan at under 5 minutes of walk; Williamsburg's Grand St. & Bedford Av. at about 10 to 15 minutes. 

Christiana is a great and honest host. She welcomed us on our arrival, gave us metrocards left by previous travellers, she bought us new towels, gave us practical infos about the building and the neigborhood. 

According to recent reviewer, the place was judged « dirty » or « unclean ». I disagree. From my point of view, the place is fairly clean. I had a hard time finding a peck of dust. True, the furnitures, the appliances and the flat itself are old and antique, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. Unlike other users, our experience was cockroach/bugs free. Anyhow, I don't want to discredit the experience of other reviewer, but some of them seem a little harsh from my point of view. You can judge for yourself, the pictures of the appartment are pretty accurate. There is no « false advertising ».

The place is small, but it is of great value (flat of this size can easily go at 160$/night in Williamsburg or East village). It is big enough for three people, with one of them sleeping on the long couch in the living room (separate room with a door). The building is quiet and this is definetly a family-friendly neigborhood.[QWERTY123]Christiana's place is great. It's a cute apartment in a great location. Everything you could need is readily available. Christiana herself is full of information and tips and can always be reached while you are staying there. The only issue would be if you are 6ft. tall the bed is going to be a little short for you. Other than that, i highly recommend the place.[QWERTY123]It is a small and simple apartment, but everything needed is there and works allright. 
It is located in the jewish orthodox neighbourhood of Williamsburg, which gives the location an exotic character. It is very near a subway station.
Negative aspects are the very small wasahbasin in the bathroom,, the absence of something against slipping in the bathand the creaking mattrass, whilst the bed stands against the wall/window, so there is only one side to get in and out for 2 persons.
[QWERTY123]Nous avons passé 10jours à 2 chez Christiana
L'appartement est bien situé dans Brooklyn: à 5 minutes à pied du métro Marcy (lignes J,M,Z)
il faut compter une 10aine de minutes de métro pour rejoindre Manhattan, 25minutes pour le centre
Christiana n'était pas là à notre arrivé mais un ami à elle nous attendait sur place pour nous remettre les clés.
C'est un appartement assez simple et fonctionnel
Comme on peut le voir sur les photos, la déco est assez vintage mais le ménage était fait et des serviettes de bains à notre disposition.
L'immeuble est calme, pas beaucoup de circulation dans la rue.
Seul bémol: la douche qui est assez vielle. 
Pas de prise de tete pour l'état des lieux à notre entrée et sortie (il n'y en a pas eu)
Satisfait du rapport qualité / prix
Thanks Christiana, +++[QWERTY123]the place was not clean and the bed was horrible.. the neighborhood was also dirty.  The sink in the bathroom was so small you could not  even wach your face.  the lighting was also poor[QWERTY123]We had a great stay at Christiana's apt. It is very cosy and comfortable. The location is  very close to a subway station and not far from Bedford Ave.. The Jewish orthodox neighborhood gives the place a  certain exotic atmosphere.

In contrast to other guests we found the apt clean enough and the mattress comfortable. There were some small bugs in the shower one day but not long after we applied the bug spray.

Christiana is a very nice person who gave us tons of tips and recommendations what to do, where to go etc. in NYC. Unfortunately though she didn't show up at the end of our stay as agreed and we had to wait a while for a message of here although we were in a hurry to get to the airport.

All in all, we had a great stay and  I can definitely recommend a stay at her place.[QWERTY123]Christiana was very friendly and reasonable about everything. The apartment was perfect for me as it was clean and comfortable.  The neighborhood was extremely accessible, safe and fun.  I would recommend staying here to anybody.[QWERTY123]The size and layout of apt was great! 
The location was - very close to train and shopping. 
The bed and sofa were very comfortable. 
The apt felt safe and secure. 
Wifi was great 
Affordable rent 
Christiana was friendly, informative and accessible. 
Definitely would recommend:)[QWERTY123]J'ai bien aimé mon séjour chez Christiana. Elle habite au coeur de Williamsburg, très bien situé, à côté du pont. C'est certain que c'est petit, mais l'appartement est sympathique et nous sommes bien contents! La clim dans la chambre était bien appréciée! Et l'hôte est bien gentille.[QWERTY123]christiana is a great host and her place is fab.  funky and cool on a quiet street, just a two-minute walk from the subway (one stop to manhattatn) and a few minutes more to all cool things williamsburg.  she was prompt, casual, helpful and friendly.  highly recommend her place to anyone wanting to explore brooklyn and beyond.[QWERTY123]We recently stayed in Christiana's apartment in Brooklyn, New York. It was an absolutely superb place to stay and Christiana was a wonderful host. The place was perfectly located in an area that was close to cool bars and restaurants. The J train is only a couple of blocks away so it was really easy to get into the centre of New York. I loved the neighbourhood as it was an Hassidic Jewish neighbourhood and it was classic to see these guys walking around in their suits and top hats . They were interested in me too and we had a few discussions about life etc.. I would definitely recommend Christiana's apartment. It was well worth it.[QWERTY123]Fabulous, convenient and comfy!  Only 5 minutes to the subway station and only about 10 minutes to grocery stores!  My daughter and I are both 5'10"" and fit in the bed easily. Christiana's apartment is extremely neat and clean, we saw no bugs.  Her kitchen is small but we had no problems making our breakfast and suppers there.  Her Internet is extremely fast, too.  Her neighbours are friendly and the neighbourhood feels very safe,  I recommend this place highly, especially if you plan on sightseeing all day and would like a comfy spot to return to at night!  Christiana's a great host!  We had 3 plane delays and arrived later than expected.  Christiana was very helpful and a great communicator.Thank you, Christiana![QWERTY123]Christiana is a really nice person and she helped us alot getting around in Williamsburg. The neighborhood is friendly and quiet, and it is easy to get to Manhattan. Or staying in Williamsburg, what is a nice and alternative area with cool bars, cafes and shops! We loved Bedford av. 
The appartement is small and old, but when that's said it is sooooo charming and with lots of personality! 
Thank you Christiana for having us and making our stay in NY perfect![QWERTY123]Our stay at Christiana's was absolutely amazing! There were three of us staying there, one sleeping comfortably on the couch and two in the bed. The apartment came equipped with everything we needed from cooking and cleaning supplies to towels and linens. We felt very safe in the neighbourhood at all times. The apartment is in walking distance to everything including amazing restaurants, shops, grocery stores, coffee shops, and movie theatres. We were able to walk almost everywhere and if we were not walking the subway stop was just steps away from the apartment. The ride into Manhattan was about ten minutes and the walk into manhattan from the Williamsburg bridge was about half an hour. 
Christiana was such a lovely host. She was extremely accommodating, very willing to help us if we needed anything at all, and provided us with fantastic recommendations of places that ended up being highlights of the trip. 
I would highly recommend Christiana's apartment to anyone looking to stay in New York, and hope I will be able to stay there again soon![QWERTY123]Christiana's place was the best!  It was exactly what we were after - a good value place in an interesting neighbourhood, close to good transport options.

The JMZ line (five mins away) is one of the most convenient lines to get into and around Manhattan.  We walked to the heart of Bedford Ave in 20 mins several times and there are plenty of Citibikes within easy distance (recommended).

For those who are a bit over Bedford Ave, we recommend Havemayer and Roebling Sts for cool cafes/bars - a couple of blocks from the flat.

As for the flat itself, it was great for what we needed - a safe, comfortable place to crash at night.  The neighbourhood is super interesting and Christiana was very laidback and accommodating.

Sample taxi fares:
From Newark - $100
From Greenpoint - $15
From Soho - $15

Will definitely be back![QWERTY123]Hi! We just got back from our wonderful 9-days NYC stay at Christiana's.
Christiana as the nice host she is, offered us the choice of check-in and check-out time which was great!
So after a short trip from JFK airport, we surprisingly arrived a bit in advance at the right address. Christina warmly welcomed us at check-in and explained everything we had to know and answered all our questions about the apartment, the do's and don'ts with clarity and kindness. 
We found her lovely old fashioned style apartment decorated with nice very personal touches. The place was just as tiny as we expected from a NYC apartment –we must confess we are accustomed to a +4500 sq feet European house. BUT, even though we were 3, we never felt the place overcrowded. Everything was also by far more organized and cleaner than every other place we had rented before.
The bed was really good, and the room had air conditioning.
On top of all this, we really must insist; ""Perfect location"" is an understatement. The Marcy metro station is only at 2 minutes (no kidding!). And the East River's banks where we took a stroll at sunset, are at  a 10-minute walk. 

Needless to say we feel lucky for having picked Christiana’s apartment in the Airbnb list !

 
[QWERTY123]We spent four nights here. The location is great - very close to the subway, which takes you into Manhattan quickly. The neighbourhood was also nice to walk around and discover - Bedford Ave etc. We even walked over the Williamsburg Bridge and over Manhattan, which was fun. 
Christiana was a great host, good communication - she met us at the flat and told us about the area.
Thanks![QWERTY123]The aparment is perfectly located, very close to subway station Marcy Avenue (3 minutes) and only one stop away from Manhattan (East Village). A very nice jewish neighborhood, a supermarket is very close and if you are a fan of fast food, Mc Donalds is just 200m from the subway station. I felt very safe all the time (even after midnight). If you are looking for an affordable place just to sleep, Christiana's place is it. Christiana is very friendly, waited for me at the apartment at the agreed time of my arrival. So, everything worked out fine for me.[QWERTY123]Christina's place was bigger than I thought it would be, which was great. It's smack in the heart of the Hasidic 'hood, so Saturday was an all day party in the streets, but never was it too loud or distracting. 

We were two adults staying 3 days and felt comfortable in the apartment. It's very close to the train, so that was a huge plus. Within walking distance to hip restaurants like Diner, Marlow & Sons, and Fatty 'Cue. 

The apartment was pretty clean--clean sheets, etc. We didn't bring food back or cook at the apartment, but I imagine it would be easy to boil up pasta, etc. 

The bathroom is small, but has very nice natural light, which was appreciated.[QWERTY123]Christiana's apartment is fantastic and is in the perfect location! We loved our stay there, and Christiana was a wonderful host. We highly recommend her apartment.[QWERTY123]Christiana is a very nice and friendly host and it was very easy to communicate with her. The apartment is on a great location in Williamsburg close to many restaurants and bars. The metro (M-Line) is very close and you need only a few minutes to get to Manhattan. I realy recommend the apartment and would stay there again.[QWERTY123]We had an awesome time in New York! And that was mainly because we saw some real New York in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. Christiana's apartment is on an amazing location, literally two minutes from the train station. We loved the fact that you are in Manhattan in no-time, but Brooklyn surprised us the most. The shops, restaurants, bars and a party in an abandoned warehouse... wow! 

Yes, the apartment is not big and in an old building. But it has lots of character, a lovely terrace on the roof and we felt totally comfortable with 3 people for 4 nights. It was literally coming home in The Big Apple. 

Thanks Christiana!

Love, 
Mark, Sabine and Karlijn[QWERTY123]The reservation was canceled 6 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.[QWERTY123]Christiana was really nice and helpful ! The flat convenient location is definitively its best asset. Located close to the JMZ stop, it also finds itself in a walking distance from Broadway's restaurant (Peter Luger, Motorino, Diner and Marlow & Sons) and the South Williamsburg ferry terminal. This is a great place to be to visit Manhattan ![QWERTY123]We're very happy with the way things worked. Christiana is a great host. Nice and friendly neighborhood. Two minutes to subway to Manhattan - which is one stop away. Overall a very pleasant experience, couldn't ask for more. We definitely recommend this![QWERTY123]We will not recommend this apartment to any of our friends. It is of decent size, but is dark and gloomy. Cleanliness gets very poor marks, in particular the bathroom where the shower curtain was so moldy that we had to remove it in order to shower comfortably. Christiana did not prove to be very communicative - she apparently was not in NY, habitually did not respond to phone calls or emails, except after several reminders. We booked the apartment for three people but there were no bed linens for the second bed and no linens were found where they were supposed to be according to Christiana's directions. We eventually had to buy an extra set (Christiana offered to pay for them). Finally, the lock to the apartment mal-functioned and the key did not fit well. these problems were, apparently, experienced by previous guests as well. We got locked out of the apartment, Christiana was un-responsive, but luckily we were rescued by a neighbor who knew that the apartment can be accessed freely through a window on the fire escape.  The neighborhood  is extremely shabby and dirty.

The positive aspects of this apartment are:the apartment does bear a certain character. Heating and warm water supply were excellent. The kitchen is well equipped. There is a good stereo system in the living room. The main advantage is the proximity of a subway station with convenient lines (J,M,Z). 
In summary - a disappointing Airbnb experience.[QWERTY123]=([QWERTY123]Great place, close to everything, small and cosy!! thanks Christiana!![QWERTY123]The location is great,  quiet for NY and felt very safe,  the Subway stop is 2 mins away,  a great line,  Manhattan is very accessible.  Grocery store around the corner from MCDonalds has lots of great fruit and veg and cheap juice bar.   Also Cute pub  callled Post Office, and coffee shop Daily press just a block from grocery store.
We had a great time in NYC.[QWERTY123]Christiana responded immediately to my last-minute reservation inquiry and was thoroughly communicative from the beginning to the end of my stay without being intrusive... Her place was clean and cozy and looked just like the pics. She was friendly, responsive, and very accommodating! I'd recommend!![QWERTY123]Christiana was out of town for the duration of our stay but was always immediately available by text message. We felt very safe in the apartment and around Williamsburg at all hours of the day. Super easy to get into Manhattan via the JMZ.[QWERTY123]Christiana is a fantastic host and the apartment is great. Although she was out of town when we arrived, she made sure the apartment was ready and available for our stay and always responded promptly to our queries. The apartment is clean, well presented and exactly as described. The apartment building was quiet and we felt safe and comfortable for the whole stay. The location is perfect for a holiday in New York. 2 minutes walk from the Marcy Avenue subway station for easy access to Manhattan and within walking distance to the rest of Williamsburg, Green Point and Fort Green. There were at least three or four different stores for everyday items within 5 minutes walk. Taxi was about $60 between JFK and the apartment.[QWERTY123]Christiana's place was amazing! she was super accommodating to me and my friends and made sure our NYC digs were fabulous. excellent communication - hopefully we get to meet next time! thanks Christiana![QWERTY123]Jag/vi var jättebesvikna. En otroligt solkig smutsig soffa, dessutom trasig! Gammal ingrodd smuts. I köket fanns en tallrik , tre glas (wow!) ett par små skålar och ett fåtal bestick. Räckte inte till 3 pers. Eftersom det var så smutsigt så klarade vi inte av att äta i denna lgh.
En totalsanering behövs! Ny soffa! Och när kackelackorna kröp på köksväggen så kände jag............pengarna tillbaka!!!!
/Margareta Alexander och Markus[QWERTY123]Christiana was communucative and helpful. We liked our stay a lot. BUT i World not recomend to rent if you are more than two grown ups. The coach was not a good enough bed to sleep in. Too. narrow and too short for a grown up person. 
Quiet and nice neighberhood. Thanks a lot.[QWERTY123]Great location! Williamsburg is such a cool part of NYC, we found loads of great eateries/bars around the Grand St area - we probably didn't even scratch the surface. Great price for where it is as well - don't know that you would get much cheaper.[QWERTY123]The apartment is in a great location - short walk to some great cafes & restaurants. Another great bonus is the neighbourhood is safe. The apartment looks like the photos. It doesn't have aircon but the fans help in the hot summer night. All in all - great location & great price!!![QWERTY123]Christina's is well located, and Williamsburg is a great place to wander around, including for food and bars. Go to Fette Sau for BBQ meats - amazing - and surrounding pubs/cocktail bars. It is also very easy to get to and from Manhattan at all hours, thanks to the 24 hour subway.

The apartment is homely, and very comfy, including both the bed and sofa (for sitting or sleeping!)

Thank you Christina - we had a great stay! Would recommend to anyone visiting NYC.[QWERTY123]Great location!  Just minutes from the JMZ to get to Manhattan.   The neighborhood is pretty quiet, but its just a few minutes walk to lots of great places in Williamsburg.  It was perfect for two people, but I think 3 would feel a little cramped because of the size.  We had a great stay overall![QWERTY123]Lots of space, good location, and painless building entry (only two flights of stairs).

I had a mishap with my flight itinerary, which lead to us arriving a day later than expected. I contacted Christiana three days before our originally scheduled arrival date to ask about a refund, but did not get a response back for days. Otherwise, she was quite communicative and friendly.

Please contact me if you're able to discern what the symbols on her spice jars mean; I couldn't figure it out :-P[QWERTY123]Christina was nice and welcoming. The check in and check out went smoothly. The apartment was fair for the price. the location is accecible, though at night the metro is less accecible (the lines change). The internet is very weak and slow.[QWERTY123]We had a great time at Christiana's apartment. The location is great, really close to the JMZ and walkable from Bedford Avenue L train. The building and street is quiet, would recommend as a base for any NY trip.[QWERTY123]Christiana's place was great, cozy place to stay for a couple travelling together. The neighborhood was very quiet and extremely convenient to get to the JMZ lines. It was so easy to navigate and get into the city with the stop so close! The internet seemed to be working just fine for us and it was helpful to have wireless access for looking up how to get around and what was available in the area. Christiana communicated with me via email and called to confirm plans as well. She also provided me with her cell phone in case any issues came up.[QWERTY123]Christiana's apartment main asset is certainly it's location. You will easily get anywhere in New York through the JMZ trains that you can catch from the station that is 2 minutes away from the apartment. Another thing that is worth mentioning is that the the place is actually bigger than it looks in the pictures, which is quite a feat for a New York apartment, it never felt crowded with 3 people in it. Finally, I'll dare you to find a place with more character than hers. Unfortunately we never got to meet her, as she was out of town when we arrived. But she was a very caring host, always answering our questions and calling me to know if everything was ok.[QWERTY123]Check in was very easy.  Christiana's place was very cozy, affordable and exactly what I needed for a one night stay.  Minor issues included the internet being a little slow when I tried to use it, and that I wasn't aware that smoking was allowed.[QWERTY123]GREAT location, literally a 2 minute walk to the subway. Maybe I wasn't looking in the right places, but the places around the apartment itself weren't that ""hip"" or appealing.. so we did almost all of our venturing in Manhattan. The apartment itself is pretty small, but it was enough for me and my friends. Wasn't able to initially get in contact with Christiana when we first checked in, but everything went well, she gave me clear instructions on how to check in beforehand (since she wasn't going to be there).  Check out was very easy as well.[QWERTY123]Christiana's apartment was the perfect base for 11 nights in New York. It really felt like home and was always warm and cozy to come back to after a cold December day. I can't stress enough how close this place is to transport either!! The JMZ station is literally around the corner and the M train takes you straight to all the main spots like the Rockefeller Centre, 5th avenue shopping etc. Getting to Manhattan was easier than I could ever have imagined! Walking to Bedford avenue restaurants and bars was an easy 15 minutes as well if you want to hang around Williamsburg. Really sad to be leaving this place!! Thanks for being such a great host Christiana. Hopefully we'll be back one day :)[QWERTY123]Notre séjour dans l'appartement de Christiana s'est bien passé. Il est très bien situé. A 2 minutes à pieds du metro. Rapide et facile de rejoindre Manhattan et les autres quartiers de Brooklyn. Bonne taille pour 2 personnes. 
En revanche, nous avons trouvé que l'endroit n'était pas très propre (exceptée la salle de bain). Nous avons dû relaver la vaisselle avant de l'utiliser. L'équipement de la cuisine est minimal. Nous n'avons pas réussi à faire fonctionner le wifi (à cause de nos cellulaires ?).
Même si nous n'avons pas vu Christiana, notre arrivée et notre départ se sont très bien passés.[QWERTY123]It was a nice place to stay in NY. Great location (less than 1 minute to the subway by walk), quite place and good host[QWERTY123]Great location for getting downtown & exploring outer Williamsburg. Cute place with all the amenities. Walking distance from some great bars & restaurants & the hipper parts of Williamsburg.[QWERTY123]Cute little bohemian apartment in a very convenient spot and super affordable for a one bedroom. Stayed by myself for three nights and felt totally safe and comfortable. Christiana was a good host, pretty easy to stay in contact with and was always eager to help and accommodate me. Thanks Christiana :)[QWERTY123]This place is just as described - great access to the metro via the Marcy Ave metro stop (only a 3 min walk from the apartment). It's in a safe, Hasidic Jewish neighborhood with a lot of families and children playing outside. It's about a 5-10 minute walk to the very hip and cool Williamsburg area. The apartment was a perfect size - not too small - just enough space needed for my husband and I to have a comfortable stay.  I would definitely recommend this place to others who are looking for a place to stay in Brooklyn while still being able to easily access Manhattan! We didn't get to meet Christiana because she was on vacation in the Bahamas, however she was still very communicative when we were arriving - making sure we made it in okay. Overall, a pleasant apartment, with a homey-vibe in the heart of Brooklyn.[QWERTY123]Quirky and original place in an interesting area! Communication wasn't the best though it worked out in the end.[QWERTY123]Exactly as described, really easy check in and out[QWERTY123]We had a really nice time in this place wich was perfectly located, so close to the subway and to all Williamsburg cool restaurants. The bathroom was not so clean but it was perfect except that. Great to stay in a quiet place after an all day in Manhattan[QWERTY123]We had a great time staying at Christianna's flat! Locations is everything, it's super close to the subway & a quick ride to Manhattan.  It's also easy walk to so many great bars & restaurants. It's also located in a quieter family type area so not rowdy at all. Our host checked in to make sure we were okay & check in & check out was a breeze. Locations is what was most important to me so I would definitely stay here again.[QWERTY123]Had a short but very nice stay at Christiana's. Great communication. See you next visit to Brooklyn.[QWERTY123]This place was great for our stay in NY. 5min walk to the Subway J, M lines. It's a small place and quite old (eg old pipes and old bathroom, shower doesn't drain very well) but for 2 people is big enough and is great value for the price. Christiana was helpful and responded to messages (sometimes it took a few days but she always responded). Very interesting Hassidic Jewish neighbourhood but walking distance to 'hipster' Williamsburg as well. Great NY experience![QWERTY123]We spent three weeks at the apartment in July/August as part of a work/holiday trip. Check in & out were straightforward, the apartment location is ideal, the building and neighbourhood are safe and easy to get around. The apartment is quirky and bohemian, the shower is good and the bed is okay, comfort wise. Christiana was fairly prompt in her communications and always friendly. I would say this is a great place for a brief stay, but not ideal for a family for a longer period (we had our 4 year old with us). The main issues we encountered were the flat being pretty dirty, even after a second cleaning visit (we found old crisp packets and cake cartons, empty bottles, a pair of glasses and big dust balls under bed when looking for a dropped toy!, most surfaces had a build up of dust/grime, the table cloth was heavily stained with food and drink spills, floors needed a good wash), the kitchen not being very well stocked with crockery, cutlery etc and a safety issue as the gas supply pipe to the cooker is faulty and if we forgot to switch the gas off at the mains after using the stove a smell of gas developed, despite all the windows being open). We let Christiana know about this and she has said she is getting it fixed and having a carbon monoxide monitor fitted.[QWERTY123]I am a long-time AirBnB traveler and host, so I hate to have to write a bad review of Christiana's place (my first bad review), but I do feel like folks should steer well clear of this listing.

First, I will say that the place is cheap. But the value is not as great as you might think. The place is in Brooklyn, not Manhattan, which should already bring the price way down. Also, I guess it's technically in Williamsburg but it's still a 5-10 min walk away from Williamsburg proper (Bedford Ave.). The neighborhood is nice and quiet, but nothing special.

When we communicated with Christiana regarding check in time, she asked if we would be ok with checking in after 8pm. Apparently she had some long-term guests staying in the place who had a late flight on their check-out day/our check-in day. I do not think it's reasonable to ask guests to check in so late to accommodate previous guests who did not plan their trip well. I communicated this to Christiana and although she agreed with me she didn't really do much to alleviate the situation. We were able to drop our bags off upon arrival but still had to wait until after 6pm for the place to get ""cleaned."" So, already the value proposition is not looking as great here.

With the admittedly low price in mind, I was not expecting the Ritz, but when we arrived after the 6pm ""cleaning"" there was very little different from when we first arrived to drop off our bags. The place is old and just not very nice inside. Again, that would be fine except it also needed a much deeper cleaning than what was done.

The floor was dirty, the mats in the bathroom hadn't been washed/replaced and were dingy, and although dishes had been washed they hadn't been put away. The sheets on the bed may have been clean but they were old and threadbare. There were flies in the apartment because windows had been left open (it was summer). The bathtub doesn't drain well so you end up standing in 6 inches of water by the end of a short shower. Only one of us could shower per morning/evening. Everything had a layer of grime on it that just made it kind of unpleasant. I could go on.

I've stayed in AirBnB places around the world, and never have I experienced one so dirty. I feel like a big part of the issue is, you'll notice, Christiana is keeping the place booked non-stop. She is not around to look at the place herself between stays so depends on somebody else who is not invested in providing a good experience and cleans a bare minimum.

Christiana should really be renting the place out to long-term tenants who would take care of the place. She can probably make more money (and avoid housing law) by flipping the place irresponsibly on AirBnB.[QWERTY123]Christiana's place was very interesting and was in a great location close to the subway. Her place was tidy and a good size for 2 people. However the bathroom could be cleaner with some inspects roaming around and the bath doesn't drain very well - if you are picky about cleanliness this could be a problem. There was very little noise in the area and it felt very safe. There is an air conditioning window unit in the bedroom but it's very noisy and not ideal to have on whilst sleeping so if it's hot outside it can be very warm inside.[QWERTY123]Buena localización, a dos calles de Bedford St (el meollo hipster de Williamsburgh) y en un barrio muy tranquilo, el metro perfecto, a 2minutos . El piso tiene las incomodidades de un piso antiguo, pero para una pareja que tenga como prioridad visitar la ciudad está bien. Con Christiana no hubo problema y todo lo que le pedimos cuando le escribimos alli nos lo arregló, buena comunicación. Buena relación calidad-precio.[QWERTY123]We had a great stay at Christiana's apartment. We were pretty much only there at night to sleep, but it was a comfortable apartment close to both public transportation and a fun Williamsburg bar scene.[QWERTY123]C'est la première fois que je réserve un logement avec Airbnb et je ne peux pas dire que je suis satisfait de cette première.

Concernant la communication de Christiana, il m'a fallu lui adresser pas moins de 4 emails pour avoir la réponse concernant la procédure d'accès à l'appartement. Cette information a été fournie in extremis, la veille de notre départ !

J'avais pourtant pris la précaution de lui demander de me faire parvenir ces éléments avant le 15 août, n'ayant plus accès à mon email à partir de cette date.
Il est vrai qu'elle s'est finalement excusée pour ne pas nous avoir répondu plus tôt et avoir ""oublié"" de ce fait, notre réservation !

Pour ce qui concerne l'appartement, j'abonde totalement dans le sens des remarques détaillées faites par Alex.

Non seulement le vidage de la baignoire ne s'effectue pas correctement (voir le commentaire d'Alex), mais il y a également deux tuyaux du plafond au sol, à droite et en avant d'un petit lavabo (genre lave-mains de WC), qui empêchent de s'en approcher suffisamment pour se raser (par exemple), ou pour recracher lors du brossage des dents - j'ai abandonné le rasage mais pas le brossage quotidien des dents ...

Le seul endroit disponible pour les vêtements est un placard avec des cintres dans le salon, aucun meuble avec des étagères. Ce qui oblige de laisser une grosse partie des vêtements dans la valise pendant tout le séjour.

Mais le plus inacceptable est que la porte d'entrée de l'appartement ne peut pas être verrouillée ! Les multiples verrous sont dans un état lamentables et inutilisables (les clés ne servent à rien), et il suffit donc de pousser la porte pour pénétrer dans l'appartement et de la tirer quand on en sort, en laissant évidemment tous les effets personnels accessibles au tout venant. Ce qui a obligé ma compagne à garder ses bijoux avec elle au cours de toutes nos sorties ! Sans faire de paranoïa excessive, nous sommes quand même à New York, même si le quartier semble paisible et peu risqué.

À propos du quartier, il s'agit d'une zone à forte proportion de religieux juifs orthodoxes, ce qui ne le rend pas très attractif pour des touristes.
Bien loin du Williamsburg trépident (évoqué dans les guides, entre autres) qui se trouve dans les environs de la station de métro Bedford Avenue. Malheureusement inaccessible de la station Marcy Avenue qui, elle, est très proche de Ross street (environ 5 minutes).

Évidemment tous ces défauts sont invisibles sur les photos du site de Christiana (probablement à cause des angles de prise de vue).

Heureusement, l'idée de prendre un petit déjeuner à l'appartement ne nous est jamais venue à l'esprit, tellement il manque de chaleur et de convivialité. Nous n'avons donc pas reconnu le charme évoqué par l'annonce du site de Christiana.

Sans connaître avec précision le prix du marché immobilier New Yorkais, je pense que cet appartement est tout de même surévalué, en dépit de son prix moyen.
[QWERTY123]We did not get a chance to meet Christina when we arrived, but she had made it easy to get in and get settled. The place is as it looks in the photos, it has a great location. Would definitely recommend, and will rent again when we get back to NYC![QWERTY123]NEVER. AGAIN. That's all I have to say[QWERTY123]We ended up not staying here because of a very last-minute change of plans. But Christiana was very nice and responsive throughout the transaction. I'm giving high marks for that.[QWERTY123]The apartment is located just next to a subway station in a Hasidic neighborhood - felt like a very safe place to be in.
The apartment looks like no one really lives there - there was a lot of dust everywhere, really bad condition of the bathroom (torn shower curtain, rust in the bottom of the bath, water don’t rinses normally and problems with the toilet) no shades in the bedroom and very old furniture - to be fair - we didn't talked with Christiana about it because it seems like that's just the way it is all the time and she doesn't have anything to do about it in a short time.
Except for that the checkout was very flexible and Christiana was nice (in the messages).
If you are sensitive to how clean and nice the apartment looks - you may face a problem - if you don't really care and only care about the location and safety if is a good fit.[QWERTY123]It was a nice apartment, great location and easy to access public transport.  The bed was on the smaller side, so my husband, who is 6 foot, had to sleep on an angle.  That's pretty much the place was used for, so not a big deal in the end. Christiana was so helpful along the way and very responsive.[QWERTY123]host was incredibly responsive on text and checking in was a breeze. neighborhood was safe and quiet and only a few blocks from the subway, which was a huge plus.[QWERTY123]Very nice time in the appartment of Christianna in Brooklyn ! Good place to move fast and easily in Manhattan. 
Christianna is always available and arranging. Thank you ! :-)[QWERTY123]Great apartment! Easy to find and access, very clean. Christiana is a great host and I would recommend staying with her![QWERTY123]The apartment is exactly like in the photos so we didn't expect much, but as soon as we arrived in NYC Christiana let us know that because of some misunderstanding with the cleaning guy it has not been cleaned. We arrived at home at 1.00 am and it was really really dirty, besides no light was working in the kitchen where we had to look for sheets and towels (as we were told by our host) in the end we went to bed without even possibly using the bathroom.
Christiana arranged for cleaning next morning (we obviously had to get out in the morning without any shower) and offered to reimbourse cleaning fee (she did that right away).
Just note that the apartment and the furniture are really old.
The bathroom is really small and the sink is so small that it's impossible to use it without getting wet, water don't rinses normally and there are problems with the toilet. The small carpet in front of the bath tube seems to have been there like... forever.[QWERTY123]Christiana was very communicative and the check in was easy. The neighborhood is safe, quiet and in close proximity to the sites in Williamsburg.  Try Otha's for nearby coffee!
The bed was sufficient but the couch is worn and not very comfortable.[QWERTY123]Staying here was like finding a hidden treasure chest. Though the pictures are a bit dark, I was positively surprised. The place has a lot of personality, and being a lover of art and culture myself, it was a very inspiring environment. (I'd come back just to read the books!!) Christiana was great to communicate with and check-in/out was flexible and easy. It's close to the subway and there's a bunch of delis and restaurants around too – found my favorite bagel place a block around the corner of McDonald's. The wifi took a while to figure out first, but once connected there was no problem - just make sure to check all the cables![QWERTY123]Christiana was very responsive. We didn't get the chance to meet her, but she was great! The apartment was ready with paperwork for wifi in case we had any issues.

The place was super cute, in a super residential area that felt very safe. Walking distance to the Williamsburg bridge and the water. It's a great location. Perfect for 1 - 3 people.[QWERTY123]Truly effortless check-in and check-out process. The space was perfect for the two of us, and the location was great.[QWERTY123]Todo perfecto! El alojamiento fue exactamente lo que describe Christiana en la publicacion, todo funciono perfecto. Si bien no pudimos conocerla (nos hubiera gustado, ya que es una artista) se comunico claramente para indicarnos como entrar y salir del departamento, asi como fue flexible y accesible a la hora de pactar los horarios de check-in y check-out. El departamento es antiguo y con un estilo muy vintage, si bien estaba en correcto estado de limpieza, las sabanas y colcha no parecian recientemente lavadas, pero nada grave. En cuanto a la ubicacion, es excelente si tu destino es Williamsbourg y Brooklyn, muy cerca del metro y del puente que te deposita en Manhattan. 
Altamente recomendable.


All perfect! The property was exactly what the publication described Christiana , everything worked perfect. While we did not know ( we would have liked , as he is an artist ) was clearly communicated to tell us how to get in and out of the department , also was flexible and accessible when agreeing schedules check -in and check -out. The department is old and very vintage style , although it was in proper cleaning, sheets and bedspread did not seem freshly washed , but nothing serious . As for the location , it is excellent if your destination is Williamsbourg and Brooklyn , near the subway and bridge that you deposited in Manhattan.
Highly recommended.[QWERTY123]I had a great stay here. The apartment is charming. The bed is cozy. The neighborhood was safe and ultra convenient. It's very close to the J train. You can easily get to and from the airport faster than a taxi or Uber. You can be in Manhattan in minutes. You can walk to lots of the great areas of Williamsburg and Greenpoint. Communication was great and getting in was easy. I even left a few little items and Christiana was on top of getting them back to me. I would stay here again for sure.[QWERTY123]We had a great stay at Christianas. It is ideally located near the subway and quick getting into Manhatten and also the rest of Brooklyn. Christiana was always helpful and very fast at communicating. Would recommend the coffee shop Othas just around the corner! It was a bit of a tight squeeze with 3 of us staying (although we were out most of the time so this was fine) - would more comfortably accommodate 2.[QWERTY123]Christiana was a great! She was very accessible and was accommodating of our schedules. The apartment was great and was exactly as described. The location is great too. The J train is within 3 minute walking distance from the apartment so getting around was really convenient.[QWERTY123]The place was very clean and cozy and had the advantage of being located very close to the subway (5 minutes) and one stop from Manhattan. Communication with Christiana was very easy, as was getting and dropping of the key. Reliable internet and great value.[QWERTY123]We had 9 lovely days in christianas apartment. We were very happy to stay there.  The apartment was close to the subway and easy to find on our way from the air port. It was easy to find shops and you can easily spend your holiday in williamsburg! Nice to watch the jeweesh peoples[QWERTY123]From the ratings we thought the place was great and we really tried!
But it's just not. Everything was kind of dirty. I know it's an old building but you can still clean it. The bed was too short and squeaky with every move. The fire escape locks were broken or nonexistent, so we didn't leave the windows open when we were away and the result was it was super hot in there. 
 The apartment smelled like cat urin and the sheets and towels were not really nice and clean.
The door knob was falling off when you tried to close the door which is not really cool when you want to leave all your belongings in the apartment. 
All in all I would not stay there again even if you paid me to![QWERTY123]Christiana was great in responding fast when I had a last minute cancelation and was desperate to find a place.
The place is value for money, not the greatest location or place but for the price you wont find much in NY - so if you are after a cheap place this is is.[QWERTY123]Convenient location, smooth communication, looks as shown in pictures. Thanks![QWERTY123]Nous n'avons pas beaucoup apprécié le quartier,  car c'était assez sale et très bruyant, à côté de la voie rapide. Le petit plus, c'est ce dépaysement dans un quartier habité presque exclusivement par des familles juives hassidiques et son atout principal est sa situation près de la station de métro Marcy Street.
Concernant le logement,  il manque une climatisation surtout pendant ces périodes de grosses chaleurs. Le lit et la chambre ne sont pas confortables et je ne vois pas comment nous pourrions rajouter une personne supplémentaire. La salle de bains n'est pas très pratique surtout l'accès au lavabo (très petit).
La cuisine n'est pas très accueillante non plus, frigo encombré de vieilles choses et placards avec insectes.
Dans le séjour, le canapé est vraiment pas confortable et assez défraichi.[QWERTY123]Thanks Christiana! Everything was great, though there were some cockroaches, nothing some traps couldn't take care of.[QWERTY123]Although we never got to meet Christiana, she was super responsive and prompt with direction and arrangements. Access to her place was ideal. The neighborhood is a Jewish community which was very safe though dirty. The actual apartment was a  disappointment. There was no air conditioner and it was 95 degrees. We were sweating terribly at night and considered leaving to get a regular hotel. Somehow we managed to stick it out. The apartment is extremely small and does not have a television. My wifi didn't work at all. The apartment is old and extremely dusty. Nothing in the apartment is new and everything is outdated. This place hasn't had any TLC in quite some time or been cleaned thoroughly for some years. If your desperate and looking for a place to crash then I suppose this is your kind of place. If you want clean, air conditioned, television, wifi, modern style comfort then I would not recommend this place.[QWERTY123]I will try to be realistic and honest.
This is New York, and this is an old building and last but not least, with AirBnB each host is free to do as they please as long as they abide by certain rules.
Christiana does not break any rules with her listing. Apart from some unrealistic approach towards the size and comfort of the bed and the charmth of the place, what you see is what you get. BUT there are rules and then there's respect. I don't think Christiana is being disrespectful on purpose, I think she is quite nice, but she clearly has never felt the need to make her AirBnB place pretty, decent, and competitive. I think she just relies on the fact that people will always book anything that's cheap(er) and that NY will never be without desperate people looking for a bargain. 
But being a world traveler myself who's stayed in hotels (big and small), hostels, guesthouses, campsites and AirBnB places from Chile to Canada and throughout Europe, I can say this was the first time I did leave the place I was staying because I just couldn't take it anymore. Sometimes it's not just how much you can put up with but why one should put up with certain things. 
And even though I can put up with no A/C, with a fan that's not working, with a terrible bed, with a place that feels like the host never visits it just goes from guest to guest to guest, with a door knob that keeps falling and nobody cares to fix (why? just because..), with linen and towels that do get washed but they've been so overused they're clearly not doing their job, I can't put up with roaches welcoming us each night and a host that says they've neglected spraying the flat. This is just too ""in your face"".
I hate leaving negative reviews and even though I always speak my mind I am the devil's advocate. But I see no reason why I should try and find good things about this experience after two amazing ones in DC and Nola where the hosts had outdone themselves in terms of providing unique experiences in much much MUCH smaller places than Christiana's. 
My biggest disappointment though is other fellow travelers who don't provide realistic reviews and mislead others. 
Summary
+ proximity to subway, safe neighborhood, walking distance to Will/burg
- neglected flat, old old old linen/towels, terrible bed, sink/bathtub drain in 10-15 so that is disgusting
---- bugs each night in kitchen sink, kitchen cupboards, bathtub, bathroom floor/walls[QWERTY123]Everything was as the description said, it's a small, charming apartment right in the heart of Williamsburg.  It's a stone throw away from the subway and there's a bunch of bars and music venues nearby.  Everything in the place is very old and antique-looking, I really liked it.  I didn't meet Christiana, although she was easy to communicate with and very clear about instructions to get into the place.  Not a lot of light but that's sort of  typical of NY apartments I suppose.  Would recommend it to anyone who is travelling with 1 person.[QWERTY123]Christiana's place was okay for us but if you want a whole comfort, this might not be The best place.
Positive points:
Safe neighborhood in hassidique community 
Really close to subway (MJZ)
Close to Manhattan center and also Williamsburg
Really good communication with Christiana

Negative points:
Clogging water in the bath and sink (old pines so difficult to fix)
Gas smell in the apartment. We locked it out so the smell disappeared
Little cockroaches due to the heat. I guess it is difficult to control of course

We had a nice stay there and we were indoor just to sleep. Moreover, it is a not too expensive for NY. Thank you Christiana![QWERTY123]Sweet little apartment as described. You get what you pay for, but it was more than enough for me![QWERTY123]Christiana's home was warm, cozy, and clean; I had an excellent stay. As a host, she was thoughtful and communicative, clearly describing how to reach and enter the apartment well in advance of my arrival, as well as the rules around the stay.

All I would note otherwise is that while she left out bath wash and conditioner, there was no shampoo, although this was fine because I had my own. Maybe I missed it?[QWERTY123]Warning : Dirty and Swindle ! Part of holiday spoiled / We left after 24h !

Attention : Sale et escroquerie ! Vacances en partie gâchée ! Nous avons quitté les lieux au bout de 24h !

Christiana est de loin la pire hôte que j'ai rencontré sur AirB&B. L'appartement qu'elle loue est non seulement un mensonge mais elle est également de mauvaise foie.
Nous avons eu un problème d'eau car TOUT était bouché (donc pas de WC, pas de douche etc.) et lorsque nous l'avons signalé, la seule issue qu'elle nous a proposé était que l'on achète nous-même un produit. Vous imaginez bien que cela ne fonctionne pas. Nous avons donc annulé le lendemain auprès de AirB&B qui a très bien géré le dossier. Cependant nous avons demandé un dédommagement pour la première nuit et le remboursement du produit, qui a été refusée par Christiana car non seulement elle est irrespectueuse mais en plus elle n'assume pas ! Elle va essayer de gagner du temps en vous répondant mais elle ne gère rien du tout et en voyant les commentaires précédents, on comprends, malheureusement nous avions réservé avant que les commentaires apparaissent !
Sans parler de la poignée de la porte d'entrée qui vous reste dans les mains, des cafards, de la poussière, du gras partout dans la cuisine ainsi qu'un canapé dans un état de saleté improbable. Si vous espérez utiliser internet, vous pouvez considérer qu'il n'y en n'a pas. 
Seul avantage, le métro n'est pas très loin.
Heureusement que tous les hôtes de AirB&B ne sont pas comme cela.
Encore merci à AirB&B qui a très bien géré la situation, n'hésitez pas à les appeler si besoin ![QWERTY123]The property was not clean and was described inaccurately. The property had roaches, especially in the bathroom where they crawled around the sink and bathtub. The floors and furniture were unclean. The bedding was dirty and was used in many prior occasions without laundry. 
The bath had been clogged up, so water would full up the bathtub, making it difficult to take shower. 
Moreover, the wifi was broken. 
There was smell of cooking gas throughout the flat, so we had to keep the windows open despite street noise and chilly weather.[QWERTY123]Christina was very good with communication by text and email.  However, the place isn't such a clean place.  We arrived and she was able to tell us the code for the front door to let us in.  She wasn't around to greet us or do a walk through but that was fine.  We got into the building and went to the place and noticed the front door was unlocked and walked on in.  The door needs the handle fixed as it was very loose.  She said she would leave a key but no key was to be found.  We had to wait for about two hours until a neighbor came back from work with a copy of the key.  The inside was pretty dark and we noticed there were roaches in the bathroom and bathtub.  We were booked for two nights and we did not take showers for those two nights.  The location is near a subway stop and a nice Hasidic Jewish neighborhood.  Other then the good location, everything else needs to be worked on.  Especially the bugs and cleanliness.[QWERTY123]Good: Christina was very nice and communicative, though she did everything online from afar, and we missed having an actual person meeting us at least when we checked in to show us around the apartment.
The apartment has a lot of character and interesting books and artwork.
Bad: the apartment is NOT in Williamsburg, it's a good 20 minutes walk from the actual Williamsburg scene (Bedford/ 7th) through not very nice streets. It's located in the middle of a ""dead"" and boring Hasidic family area.
The apartment is OLD and DIRTY, everything was grimy and dusty and there were roaches running around all over our stuff. 
Good thing we only ended up staying two nights and not the whole week like we originally planned.[QWERTY123]Great little place in Williamsburg. Very close to transport. Cozy and convenient.[QWERTY123]The appartment is perfect if you're travelling alone. The appartment is located in a quiet jewish neighbourhood and 3 minutes walking distance from the subway and 15 min walking distance from lots of nice bars in Williamsburg. Therefore I can definetly recommend it! 

The appartment itself is old but everything works fine. Only thing that took me a while to figure out was the wifi. The sheets, livingroom, bath room were clean. Just don't expect something flashy and modern. I haven't had any trouble with roaches. So I guess that problem has been solved. 

Christiana is good in communication and easy to get in touch with. I'd recommend this appartment to anyone who just needs his/her own space in the evening/at night and plans to be outside and explore NYC.[QWERTY123]Staying at Christiana's was amazing! PERFECT location, very cute neighborhood, and all very well taken care of! While it was small, it was all the two of us needed and I would absolutely stay there again and recommend it to anyone taking a trip to NYC. Thank you for everything Christiana![QWERTY123]The place wasn't in Williamsburg, it was about a 10-15 minute walk, which wasn't horrible. The neighborhood was safe and had a few convenience stores within walking distance. The J,M,Z trains were really close, so that was a plus. Everything worked except the wifi, which I tried contacting the host about and never received assistance. Luckily, I have unlimited data. There were roaches in the bathroom and kitchen, which most were around the drawers and cabinets. I stayed for 3 nights, and on my last night getting back to the apt, the door was unlocked and all of my stuff was moved around. Come to find out, ""the maid"" came in to clean for the next guest on the wrong day. I had also purchased a few bagels from the Bagel Store and they were thrown away. All the linens were changed out, so I'm not sure if they are actually going to launder again before the guest after me. It wasn't horrible but I'm not sure if it's worth $110/night.[QWERTY123]Good location to get to Manhattan quickly. Not too big, but cozy and reasonable priced. Building is a little run down, but works if you are not picky about that type of stuff. I think we got lucky finding a parking spot right in front of the building. Not sure how difficult that usually is.[QWERTY123]The apartment felt very comfortable as if you lived there which feels nice. It really depends on a persons expectations - if you are looking to stay in Manhattan then this is not the place. In this area one street can differ from the other as in how finished the house fronts are. The area is predominately hasidic jewish which maybe a new experience for some - I felt quite safe in the area so the process of having the door open on arrival might at first make you feel unsure but it is not a problem. Very convenient to take the train into Manhattan. The neighbours were quite friendly[QWERTY123]The host canceled this reservation 17 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.[QWERTY123]Christiana was always very kind and helpful and all matters requested. The apartment was comfortable and according to what we expected. Location is super nice, less than 5min walking to the subway and 1 stop from Manhattan! It really makes it reachable from the city and we saved time. The only unpleasant issue is that I found it noisy to sleep (it shouldn't be a problem other than summer when the windows are closed and it really makes it decrease).[QWERTY123]The place was secluded but still just a short walk to everything, including the transit, restaurants,  nightlife and stores.[QWERTY123]Great location, close to transport[QWERTY123]The host canceled this reservation 30 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.[QWERTY123]SUPER cozy place in a great street in Brooklyn. spacious and the a/c unit in new york heat was clutch. Probably one of the coziest airbnb's ive ever stayed in."	40.70984316206218	-73.9577503105816	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/20913	2	100.0	0.88

and public transportation, not far from Lincoln Center.[QWERTY123]Location, location,location! We were very happy with the apartment.  Laurelle was a great host and her apartment was cute and cozy![QWERTY123]The Hostess was considerate in all ways. The space had a peaceful calm that left me smiling. New York Funky, Organic, and Charming.Would gladly stay again.[QWERTY123]Very convenient location for the price. Would benefit from getting a small table and coffee pot to be able to have breakfast before leaving to explore NY! Thank you Laurelle for allowing us to stay at your place. I hope you didn't get too wet from camping! H & W[QWERTY123]We stayed for a week at New Years Eve and really enjoyed Laurelle's place. Very centrally located, nice and warm with a really good shower (very important). Laurelle was a very nice host. Would gladly stay again.[QWERTY123]Stayed at Laurelle's for a few nights and loved walking around to Central Park and close attractions. Got some serious touristing done because of the location. Would definitely repeat![QWERTY123]Was quite happy with my visit. The price was good, the location was about perfect. No surprises, and Laurelle was great to deal with.[QWERTY123]This review is 6 months late but I'm still glad to come back to AirBnB. My boyfriend and I stayed here in May 2010, during the week of the Times Square foiled bombs. Although we never met Laurelle (she was out of town), this was a fantastic pad for a week's visit. I'd lived in Manhattan for 4 years previously and never knew how awesome the Hell's Kitchen district was. Solid affordable accommodation in Manhattan. :)[QWERTY123]Very Cute apt. Laurelle was very responsive and easy to deal with. Great location and clean what more can you ask for?[QWERTY123]Laurelle's place is in a great location, very close to great restaurants and shows! The apartment is clean and cozy with a great shower! Laurelle is wonderful to deal with very quick to respond and accommodating.  Would definitely stay here again.[QWERTY123]Staying at Laurelle's apartment was a real treat! It is conveniently placed and walking distance from several restaurants, theaters, bars and subway stops. When we weren't out exploring the city, we were comfortable and entertained in Laurelle's apartment with access to a computer and television. Thanks, Laurelle![QWERTY123]We couldn't have asked for a better apartment, location, or hostess! This place is a wonderful little studio with so much character right in the heart of the city. Laurelle was always available to answer questions. Fantastic overall experience and highly recommended![QWERTY123]Good location.Laurelle is very kind and the apartment is near to all New York attractions. We only had some problem with some beattles in the bathroom and in the kitchen. I think is a New York old problem. She told us she's going to extermite them.[QWERTY123]What a fantastic location! Very short walk to Central Park and Times Square and near a subway station and Whole Foods store. Laurelle was very welcoming and the apartment was clean and tidy for us. We were also able to leave our bags during our last day and return later to collect them, which was a big help. The neighbourhood was very safe and for first time New York visitors it was a great place for us to be very inexpensively.[QWERTY123]
My boyfriend and I stayed at Laurelle's place from Sept 1st to Sept 5th and it was absolutely Perfect!! Great location, great apartment, great host! It was just a couple of blocks from Central Park and Time square without being too crowded or loud. Subway lines are very close too! We were so pleased with everything. Thank you so much Laurelle for making this trip a fantastic one!![QWERTY123]We stayed 5 nights at Laurelle's place and it was great.  Easy and flexible check in and out, plus access to her computer! The flat is central and quiet, a nice addition is hearing the clip clop of horse/carriages driving by.[QWERTY123]We stayed at Laurelle's place for one night on 12/18/10. She was a gracious host and thankfully didn't mind that traffic put us over an hour late to check-in! The apartment was clean and inviting and the location can't be beat. We had a fabulous stay and would definitely stay at Laurelle's again.[QWERTY123]We stayed with Laurelle for New Years Eve weekend, and it was a wonderful visit.  Her apartment was walking distance from good restaurants and she was really helpful in giving recommendations.  Her apartment was eccentric and quite a relaxing place to be.   We will stay there again the next time we return to the city.

[QWERTY123]Super![QWERTY123]Great location, very clean, and quiet.[QWERTY123]Laurelle was very hospitable and easy to contact. Her place was perfect for two people to stay in and the location was great. The building is quiet and the doorman was very helpful and sweet! The apartment is close to the subway and walking distance from several bars and restaurants in the area. I highly recommend it![QWERTY123]Perfect location close to the subway, Central Park, great restaurants and delis. So as a base to discover Manhattan it's absolutely spot on. The apartment itself is as described, located in a relatively calm street away from the crowds and a positive plus was quiet neighbours in the building. Laurelle was a great host, both in communicating before, during and after the stay, Couldn't be better![QWERTY123]This place was as nice as described on the website. We loved it and we would stay there again: great location, the place was quiet, welcoming and very clean. The bed was good and the shower very nice. Laurelle was very helpful and nice. We loved it!
We highly recommend this place!![QWERTY123]Laurelle's studio is charming, cozy and perfect for two people. Located in a very nice area of Manhattan, with a comfy bed and good shower.   

We felt like locals and had a really cool experience.  It is close to lot's of nice restaurants, bars and delis.  Walking distance from Central Park, Times Square and all major metro lines.  There is a doorman, elevator and it is very well equiped.

It could be a bit more organized and clean. I also suggest  to make some more space to leave gest's personal luggage.  Apart from that the place is perfect!

[QWERTY123]We stayed in Laurelle's apartment for 5 nights in July 2011.  The apartment is exactly as shown in the photos.  It is situated in a very good location and within easy walking distance of Central Park and Time Square.  There are also some very good restaurants in the area.  Laurelle was a very good host and recommended things for us to see and do in the area.  I would definitely stay here again.[QWERTY123]Great Location!!![QWERTY123]We stayed here for a week and really enjoyed the central location.  Times Square, Central Park, subways, supermarkets and hell's kitchen restaurants were all easy walking distance.  Tommi was super helpful with directions from the airport which made connections much easier.  The apartment is surprisingly quiet given the busy city is right there.  Using the laundry facilities in the building was also handy towards the end of our stay.  We also used the computer at the apartment for getting on the internet to book things and check out things to do.  The photos are exactly what you can expect, it's not a huge place but doesn't claim to be, it's still muh better than a hotel at a similar price![QWERTY123]great place[QWERTY123]Quiet, safe, comfortable, charming.  Superb location.  Great value.  Laurelle was a kind and considerate host, and great with communication.  The Midtown Pied-a-terre will be at the top of my list when I visit the area again.[QWERTY123]Love, love, loved it! Brilliant location, beautiful apartment, lovely host. Not a bad word. Hot powerful shower. Comfy bed (if your under 6ft 4 and not a big sook). Close to delicious food- both restaurants and markets. Super close to great shows and times square! Will def stay here again on next visit. Thanks![QWERTY123]Highly recommended. great space, great location, and very gracious and professional home owner.[QWERTY123]Tommi's place was clean (smelled of cinnamon) and set up to accommodate our needs perfectly. We needed an extra bed which Tommi helpfully set up for us in advance. She also left little post-its for us that explained everything we needed to know - the locations of tucked away power outlets, where the kitchen utensils were etc. 

She was also a great communicator - replying to emails quickly as well as keeping in touch via SMS to make sure we were settled in OK.

I would definitely consider staying here again.[QWERTY123]Wow, was so nice I enjoyed my stay so well I hardly knew I was there !! Went by much too fast !! 
Thanks Tommi[QWERTY123]Tommi's apartment is just as described. Perfect location - grocerys, restaurants, fast foods, pharmacys, closest subway 2 blocks away, central park just 5 blocks - everything you need by walking distance. It has a confortable bed (but taller people may have problems), a nice kitchen (doesnt have a microwave) and a bathroom (with a body mirror!) 

Tommi is the most wonderful host, always helping when needed (when we didn't know how to use the tv, or to close the windows), she let us use the apt telephone to make local calls and even though she wasnt in town she send a friend to deliver the keys and was always there to assist us.

The things I wasn't very glad about was the lightning, witch are very poor, even if you turn on all the lights and the bathroom curtains witch doesnt close very well and overflows the bathroom. 
Also, the tv is old and it's kind of difficult to deal with it, but you won't go to NYC to watch tv so thats fine. Other than that, great stay and would definatelly book again.[QWERTY123]Excelente ubicación. Muy amable el trato con Tommi. El apartamento es acogedor y cálido.[QWERTY123]We had a great stay at the apartment. Location was absolutely fantastic, literally walk out the door and you're in Central Park and a short walk gets you to the heart of time square. Apartment itself was great, warm and cost and had all the amenities we could have asked for. The host was also extremely helpful and very easy to get along with.[QWERTY123]Tommi's place is nice and cozy, and perfectly located for the main touristy area as well as some nice bars and restos in Hell's Kitchen area. Communications with Tommi were always timely, and friendly.  I recommend the place for a couple more than for friends.[QWERTY123]Our time at Tomis apartment was great! The apartment is just like the pictures, there is even a full mirror, which was great! It's in a great location, close to all the main subway lines, we could even go to Times Square walking! And Tommi was a great host, always helpful.[QWERTY123]This studio flat in Midtown was a great location and cozy and comfy.  And Tommi was super helpful about seeing to our needs!  Had a great time.[QWERTY123]Thank you so much Tommi for having us in your home!!! 
The location is truly perfect. Cafes at your doorstep and the park from a few blocks away.
The studio is cozy and so inviting. The bed is super comfy and the shower was great!
Thanks for making it so easy Tommi.

We hope to stay again:)

Cx[QWERTY123]WOW!  What a great stay.  Perfect location.  Happy to see there was an Elevator.  Parking Garage on the same street.  Tommi was very nice and accommodating.  the space was comfortable and perfect.  Plenty to do within walking distance.  If you are looking for a place in Midtown.  Stop looking.  This is the place.[QWERTY123]Personification of great hospitality. Came to my rescue twice when i had no place to stay. Excellent communication. A cozy apartment near an amazing location. Everything in a walking distance. Tommi has been very professional in detailing out everything that one needs during a short stay. Love the apartment![QWERTY123]We were very happy with the location which was absolutely perfect! I also very appreciate the responsible and reliable attitude of Tommi, who responded us always immediately and was very helpful with everything. The cooperation and personal attitude was 100% satisfaction.[QWERTY123]Tommi (Laurelle) was very helpful and informative and answered any communication very quickly.  Her apartment is in a great location, with lots of nice bars and restaurants close by and not far from Times Square and Broadway.  There are no stairs to enter the building and there is a lift, so perfect if stairs are a problem.  The apartment is small but works well for one or two people.  There are a lot of personal belongings in and on every surface in the apartment and a completely full fridge so very little room for hanging clothes or storing food, and no microwave.  The TV is old and must be turned on and off via a switch on the TV. Laurelle was very kind and helpful, a lovely host.[QWERTY123]This place was great, perfect distance from everything. Plenty of restaurants and stores around within walking distance. We stayed here for New Years and walked to time square for the ball drop. The apartment itself was cozy and just what we needed for the stay. Tommi was great and i would stay here again.[QWERTY123]Un super emplacement !! Je recommande à qui veut visiter Manhattan !! Hôte adorable, qui vous indiquera de bonnes adresses. Idéal pour un couple.[QWERTY123]Great location.   Very nice building.   Small but nice studio.  Perfect for solo or couples.[QWERTY123]La comunicación con Tommi ha sido muy buena desde el principio. Estaba en el piso para recibirnos, a pesar de que el avión llegó con retraso y me escribió durante la estancia para asegurarse de que todo estaba bien. El apartamento está bien situado y dispone de todo lo detallado en el anuncio. La cama es cómoda y la ducha funciona bien. Sin embargo, las sábanas tenían manchas y agujeros, la cortina de la ducha presentaba moho y, en general, el piso no estaba tan limpio como nos hubiera gustado.[QWERTY123]Appartement très bien placé entre central park et time square. à 3 minutes à pied du métro. Tommi est vraiment très gentille et nous a très bien accueilli. Le logement est très sympa, il manque juste une table et une armoire pour mettre ses vêtements. Mais lors d'un séjour à New-York on est plus dans la rue qu'enfermé dans un appartement :)[QWERTY123]This apartment was super cute and in the perfect location! There was a doorman and elevator too which was a plus. I would recommend this place to anyone.[QWERTY123]The location was great and Tommi was very helpful and accomdating. The apartment is a bit small and crowded, so there was not a lot of place for personal belongings. Also, there is a strong smell of incense and aromatic oils in the apartment, which can be problematic for people with allergies.[QWERTY123]Tommi  (Laurelle) was a great host. Nice, helpful and answering any questions very fast.
The apartment was in a great and safe location close to Times Square, Broadway, Central Park and Metro Stations. Nice Bakeries, Restaurants, Bars, small Supermarkets were very close.
The apartment is small and as shown on the pics.  A bit crowded, so not a lot of space for our belongings.  but ok for 1 week.
Laurelle, thank you. You were a lovely host.[QWERTY123]We could not have asked for anything more! Tommi (Laurelle) was a wonderful, gracious hostess. The space is quirky, cute, and the location is ideal! We rarely needed to use Uber, many activities are well within walking distance. Highly recommended![QWERTY123]The house was very confortable ! 
Nice ubication near subways and a lot of restaurants. Downstairs there is a doorman so u will be secure and safe.
Laurelle was very kind with us, easy to comunicate and very respectfull. She
 help us with all that we need. Great host, reccomended 100%![QWERTY123]The location of Laurelle's (Tommi) home is perfect. Safe neighborhood and walking distance to restaurants, CVS, Central Park, coffee shops, etc. Also close to transit entrances, so we never had to take an Uber or cab! Loved the vibe of this unique little apartment. Laurelle greeted us upon check in to exchange keys and share recommendations for places nearby. Overall, we had a positive experience during our weekend stay![QWERTY123]This apt. has a really groovy, funky decor and vibe - tons of character - I loved it!  I felt very comfortable there. It's small but not at all cramped. Laurelle (Tommi) was super responsive and a good communicator, and very friendly and welcoming. All the info was clear and there were no surprises with her place. The building is safe and I felt very comfortable staying there as a single female. The building itself is on a quiet residential block, but the street one block away is chock full of restaurants, bars, cafes, diners, grocery stores, drug stores, etc. A great location convenient to all that Midtown has to offer. Enjoyed my stay very much![QWERTY123]Tommi's place was a nice place to stay in New York. She was extremely responsive and very nice about everything. The apartment was very busy with her stuff, but that wasn't bothering much. The location is great.[QWERTY123]Her place is great!
I live in NYC but needed a place to stay for the weekend.
The neighborhood is great, so many good choices of places to eat!
I never got such a good nights sleep.
Her apartment is so relaxing even with the liveliness of the neighborhood."	40.767153848269224	-73.98532907164787	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/9357	2	150.0	0.833333

 ( Athome) within walking distance where I enjoyed an early breakfast.  One of my adult sons lives a short distance in the Ridgewood area of Brooklyn so the apt. is very convenient.  I most definitely will stay on my next trip to New York.  Rita H[QWERTY123]A friend and I needed a place to stay just for one night, and Sylvia's place fit the bill. It's very comfortable, and the bedroom is quiet. The living room is on the road, so there's a normal amount of street noise.

The subway is close by, and we were also able to find street parking pretty easily, since we drove to NY. It's not an upscale place or an upscale neighborhood, but it doesn't advertise itself as such either, so just read the listing![QWERTY123]Silvia is a lovely hostess, very helpful and knowledgeable about the area. The apartment was clean and comfortable. Thanks![QWERTY123]Silva's place is a great value in the city.  We enjoyed being close to the trains and appreciated her gracious hospitality.  The lovely new wine bar almost next door had great food and the store on the corner allowed us easy access to anything we needed along the way.  Because of the affordable pricing, we were able to spend more time in New York! 

Thanks Silvia!

[QWERTY123]Silvia made made my trip perfect. The appartment was so clean, next to the train. She gave me a kit with all the bar, restaurant and cool stuff around the appartment.[QWERTY123]Silvia's is a great spot to stay in Bushwick. A super clean, glowing space that served as a perfect homebase for four nights. Silva provided us with a package of brocures and maps which came in very handy; My boyfriend, his Dad and me tripped to Manhattan most days and explored Bushwick in the mornings and evenings.  We went to the Tapas resto right next door... SOooo fine! Plus Tomo Japanese fusion down the street, Brooklyn Natural for super sandwiches, Little Skips for strong black coffee under the elevated train, a diner on Myrtle was great for people watching...I wish I could have tried more places Silvia suggested...next time! All three of us recommend you stay with Silvia![QWERTY123]A really great place to stay - clean, spacious and comfortable apartment, easy access to metro lines, interesting area to explore that we felt safe and comfortable walking around, lots of good places to eat/buy food, and most importantly the helpful and friendly hosting by Silvia and her family. 
We stayed in both apartments at different parts of our trip. Silvia was very helpful and accommodating to our travel plans (coming from the UK and visiting New York and Canada). The local info was really helpful, tapas next door and tortilla factory both favourites with us! Highly recommended, would love to go back again![QWERTY123]We stayed for four nights and loved the friendly neighborhood-feel of the area! We had both stayed in Manhattan several times in the past, but it was our first time in Bushwick. We went to many of the places walking distance from Silvia's place and enjoyed them all: from the nearby bar with two stages, to the coffee shop recommendations, to great restaurants and grocery-deli stores. Most people were very friendly, very chatty - though it was during the World Cup so people were talking or teaching us about the games - or we were talking about our visit to Coney Island, and they were all very good-naturedly listening to us, the tourists. The place was very clean and well furnished, and Silvia was a great host, answering all of our questions (and yes, the taxi for La Guardia really did arrive in 2 minutes!) We would stay again, and stay for longer next time.[QWERTY123]Silvia was a great host and the apartment was perfect for what we needed. It was really clean and comfortable. Thanks Silvia![QWERTY123]My wife, our two year old son and I have just had a wonderful week's stay at Sylvia's place. The apartment is very spacious, well-equipped and kid friendly. It's less than a 10 minute walk to the L train station and it's a 15 minute ride to Manhattan. Shops, restaurants, a supermarket and a park with a great playground are all within a block's walk. 

Sylvia was very friendly and helpful. She lives in the same building and was often around for a chat, and full of tips and suggestions of things to do and places to go. And our son made friends with her daughter!

The location in Bushwick was great. It is not as trendy as Williamsburg and other parts of Brooklyn but is just on the cusp of gentrification. So you get the benefits of a gentrified neighbourhood – it's completely safe, very arty and there are some great shops and restaurants – but it's still a real place with real people, which we loved. Plus it's not too expensive and as I mentioned, you get more space for your money. 

We'll definitely stay there again the next time we visit NYC![QWERTY123]Everything was perfect.  The apartment was very clean and spacious and had everything that we needed. We especially enjoyed the original artwork/sculpture in the apartment including the beautiful new handmade bed that is not currently shown in the photos.  Silvia is a great host - friendly and professional.  My only regret is that we didn't have time this trip to explore the Bushwick neighbourhood art scene.  Perhaps next time.  We would gladly stay here again.[QWERTY123]I had a really good stay at Silvia's place in Bushwick. The place was super clean and had everything we needed. We didn't explore the 'hood very much but could find our way around with no problems - the L train was the most convenient line for our visit and the walk from Silvia's place was quick and safe. Great bagels and coffee around the corner at Alizze (sp?) Cafe! The only caveat about the place is that it is a bit noisy - it is on a fairly busy street with a bus stop and lots of foot traffic. I am a heavy sleeper and wasn't bothered by it but others might not like it... but if you want the real NYC/Brooklyn experience, there's going to be a little bit of noise! 

Great hosts - would recommend to friends and would stay again. Thanks Silvia! :)[QWERTY123]We had a great stay at Silvia's apartment. The place was clean and cozy. We would definitely stay with Silvia again. Thank u![QWERTY123]The apartment was clean and spacious with a good kitchen and bathroom. There was a laundromat across the road, which was handy. We were only three blocks from the subway but the trip itself to Manhattan took about 20 minutes. Silvia and her family were friendly and helpful.[QWERTY123]I and my husband had a great time at Silvia's place. We stayed there for six days; the map with all the list of bars and cafes around the Bushwick area was a great help. Although, we couldn't spend much time in the neighborhood, we were able to drop by a few places Silvia recommended just before the night we left. The excellent pizza at Roberta's and good music and food at the Tandem bar make me feel like visiting Silvia's place again on our next trip to NY. We also enjoyed the sculpture works by Silvia's husband! Also, the Bushwick area is a great place to explore for those interested in art. Thanks a lot again, Silvia :)[QWERTY123]The apartment was big, bright, clean and provided all the simple necessities one needs. The location presents a wonderful perspective of what the real city is like, but still with a healthy dose of hipster cool just around the corner. Will definitely go on my short list![QWERTY123]Sylvia is a nice host, welcoming and available when you have questions.The apartment was spacious, light and provided all the simple necessities one needs. It can be noisy of traffic but if you close the door to the bedroom it's okay. The art that was currently up is less colourfull than is shown on the pictures but as a guest you have the opportunity to live with Tyrone Tripoli's art which I appreciated so much that I have posted some pictures on Face Book / FollowMyworld (see photo-album The apt. is full of Tyrome Tripoli's objects). Nice kitchen, very cosy. Tip! Bring your ipod and speakers if you want some music;)  The location is in the heart of Bushwick and gives you a good feel of what the real city is like, and I agree with the previous recommandation 'it still is with a healthy dose of hipster cool just around the corner'. Great urban art, you only see in this part of BK. We think Roberta's is one of the best restaurants we have been to and Northeastern Kingdom. Also check out Tandem (see the design;) and Life Cafe nine83. 24/7 grocery shopping is possible at Hana Natural, but it's a bit pricey. Will definitely recommend this place to friends![QWERTY123]Spacious area filled with light and convenient location in a lively community. Slyvia's knowledge and guide of the local area extremely helpful. We had a wonderful time![QWERTY123]Silvia was a great host and very knowledgeable about the area; we were travelling with a toddler and Silvia was very accomodating with this. The space was simple, clean, and had everything we needed. We really liked the character of the Bushwick area, and found the access to other parts of the city via transit to be good.[QWERTY123]Staying at Sylvia´s apartment has been a great experience. She is always available to help you and the apartment is big and confortable. I definitely recommend this apartment![QWERTY123]I spent just over 4 weeks in Silvia's and Ty's apartment and it was such an experience. If you are looking for a NYC experience that is more about how people in Brooklyn and NYC really live you should stay here. Silvia and Ty were just lovely, very helpful, I really enjoyed meeting them. The space is very good, close to everything you could want to see in Bushwick, close to the L train to get to Williamsburg and Manhattan. It's on a fantastic street.

I found myself actually staying more in Bushwick, its a community that is diverse and artistic. Would stay there permanently if I could.[QWERTY123]Great Apartment, good supermarket close by, L train from Jefferson St straight into downtown Manhatten , watch out for scheduled closures due to upgrading the line. Alternative station for the J is Myrtle Ave. 10 mins walk. The apartment is on a fairly busy road so if you are used to tranquil evenings at home be prepared for some traffic noise ( I was sleeping on sofa so this may not apply if you were in bedroom.)

The area is a bit like Peckham or Brixton in London if you know those areas.
If you want Caps and sports clothes look no further than ""Capworld"" I think on Knickerbocker, my son spent hours trying on stuff in there. Unfortunatley we didnt get to try the legendary Roberta's Pizza but we did go to the LA ..... mexican takeaway 5 mins to the left out of the house which was great, much better than it looks. Go and check out the Brooklyn Museum some great work and very quiet during the week.[QWERTY123]Sylvia's place was perfect: I was there for just over two weeks and I'm sure of the fact that my NYC stay wouldn't have been as good had I booked a hotel or hostel. The location is great - close enough to walk to a bunch of good bars, two great subway lines within blocks (the L and M), but removed enough from the madness of NYC that I tend to find stressful. Plus Sylvia and her family are really lovely and are just upstairs for all the help you need. Would love to stay here again whenever I come back.[QWERTY123]We had a wonderful time at Silvia and Ty's apartment.  Bushwick is loads of fun with great spots to eat and friendly merchants.  We were 3 blocks from the Jefferson Street L stop - into Manhattan in :15 - :20 minutes.

Silvia was very helpful both before we arrived and during our stay.   She was also flexible on our check in and check out time.  Much appreciated.  Don't forget to ask for the (Hidden by Airbnb) interactive map she created of the neighborhood.  We had a great time in both Brooklyn and Manhattan.

The apartment was warm and quiet.  Loved having laundry privileges, we were able to purchase detergent 1 block over - very easy. 

We hope to be able to stay here again on our next visit to NYC - it was the perfect space for our family.[QWERTY123]Nice place to stay for a few days! 5 minutes to subway and 20 minutes to get to Manhattan. Very clean rooms and bathroom. There is park and a supermarket near the house where you can buy food and everything else. 
Perfect place if you don’t need Manhattan itself and you are looking for a flat to spend some nights there.
Thank you, Silvia![QWERTY123]Great place. Very central to public transportation and lots of activity and interest in the neighborhood.  Silvia and Ty are good hosts - not intrusive, available when you need them and generous in making sure your needs are met. Examples: room air conditioners - what a blessing; use of the washer and dryer; second set of keys; fully equipped kitchen down to spices in the cupboard.[QWERTY123]Very clean, comfortable, well situated apartment with good airconditioning,  access to washing machine and dryer - good bathroom/shower, fridge, wifi, cooker etc.
In friendly quiet neighbourhood 15 mins to Manhattan and 10 mins to Williamsburg. Several cool bars and decent shops in area. 
Highly recommended - would stay there again.[QWERTY123]Somewhat dated, but an ok experience[QWERTY123]Well, we stayed at Silvia's place during 5 days and i have to say that it was perfect ! We met some wonderful persons and have a great memories of this moment. 
Thanks a lot, Silvia and Tyrome, for all you have done for us, hope to see you again ! Of course, we keep in touch for the documentary project.
Thanks !
[QWERTY123]Everything all right! Perfect location! Nice neighborhood ! Silvia is a good  host. ciao
[QWERTY123]We had a nice stay at Silvia's place. The bedroom is quiet for sleeping and the bed is very comfortable. We really liked the local neighbourhood and discovered some real gems. ""Miles"" across the street and up a bit is a beautiful little ambient hipster bar. Then there's Cafe Ghia for brunch a few blocks away. Northeast Kingdom near Jefferson Station was also lovely for dinner. Williamsburg isn't far and the apartment is close to various subway lines so we were in and out of Manhattan and Downtown very easily. 

Thank you Silvia!
[QWERTY123]We enjoyed the Bushwick location. It's definitely more ""edgy"" than Williamsburg, but not in a bad way. Nobody disturbed us. We met parents with their kids out almost at midnight in the nearby park. 

Nice cafeterias and restaurants within walking distance. Silvia has a very comprehensive map/folder ready about the nearby places and restaurants, even with menus. We took several of these tips into use. Roberta's pizza place was something to be seen to be believed. :) Small shops and nice grocery stores were near.

The apartment was lovely, very spacious for two. Good to have the fridge and a full kitchen ready. If looking for something to improve, the bed was a bit creaky. Silvia was helpful, getting the keys was no problem. 

Connections to Manhattan are good, a 10 min walk to reach either the Myrtle or Jefferson St stations.

Would come here again![QWERTY123]Our visit to NY was enhanced by our stay at Silvia's, which was a cost-effective alternative to staying in a hotel.  The apartment was clean, comfortable and convenient to two subway lines.  The artwork was fun.  We enjoyed music and meals in nearby Williamsburg, and loved breakfast at Cafe Ghia a short walk away.  Trips to Manhattan to art museums were easy.  The street noise during the night was noticeable, but not overwhelming.  We would be delighted to stay there again.[QWERTY123]I stayed in Silvia's home for 2 months
it was perfect
near L subway-you reach manhattan in 20 minutes
we cooked our meals the kitchen is great and 2 great supermarket in the area.
will come and stay here again for sure
quite, friendly, nice[QWERTY123]Fab place, we didn't really want to move out at the end of our week.[QWERTY123]This was a great 1 bedroom flat which I rented for 5 weeks while I was staying in New York. Great value for money and just a 5-10 minute walk to Morgan Ave metro which is super convenient for Manhattan. Silvia was great and was super helpful. The info she provided about the local area was fantastic. Would definitely recommend for anyone looking in the area.[QWERTY123]Silvia is a really nice host and her place was perfect for my parents' holidays[QWERTY123]Première expérience avec airbnb positive. L'appartement de silvia est  plus grand que ce que je voyais sur les photos. une grande cuisine . Une bonne connexion wifi (non négligeable à NY ). Quartier latinos sympathique , avec tout ce qu'il autour , supermarché , laverie , bar ,.... Un parc à 200m , et la station de metro à 500m. comptez 20 mn pour midtown union square . Silvia sera toujours prête à vous donner de bons conseils , et à vous rendre service . NY est quand même assez bruyant , et les normes d'isolations phonique moins efficaces qu'en europe . De toute façon , après une journée dans big apple , il n'y a plus qu'à dormir ![QWERTY123]Great stay in Bushwick, Silvia was a super nice host! She was there when we arrived to give us the keys and provided a map with interesting places in the neighborhood. Great apartment, clean and perfect for two non-couple people. Will definitely come back![QWERTY123]Great place! Great area! I stayed 3 weeks here, and I really felt at home. Silvia is a very kind and respectful person. The apartment is very clean. very good wifi connection. close to the subway. Bushwick is amazing! Silvia did a perfect Bushwick guide. I totally recommend this place. 
Super endroit! Je suis restée 3 semaines et je me suis sentie comme à la maison. Silvia est une personne très gentille et respectueuse. L'appartement est propre, très bonne connection wifi. proche du metro. Bushwick est genial! Silvia a fait un guide très complet du quartier. Je recommande cet endroit. Thank You Silvia.[QWERTY123]Great communication & helpful information about local places to visit.  Close to subway which made it very easy to get around.  Enjoyed our stay![QWERTY123]Silvia's place is roomy and has lots of light.  She was a lovely host who greeted us in her warm apartment after a very late arrival, due to a blizzard that brought the city to a standstill.  

The bedroom was private, the sheets and towels were soft and the apartment was warm in that wintry weather.  But this is Brooklyn and this part of Brooklyn is not calm, soothing or quiet.  The hustle and bustle outside was constant, cars honking, streetlights shining through sheer curtains and general noise throughout.  We were not expecting the noise and disquiet that identifies Brooklyn and my son found sleeping on the futon uncomfortable because of the orange light piercing the windows and the constant blare of horns.  I remind him ""when in Rome, do as the Romans do"" and remember we aren't in Kansas (or Australia) anymore.

Silvia's place is not lush nor sumptuous, it's built to drop your bags and explore from there. It felt more transient than homey. It's roomy, it's a place to lay your weary head and use a pretty good kitchen.  It's not a quick trip into NYC, it's a tramp down busy streets and a sightseers subway ride to be discharged into the bowels of the City.  It's Brooklyn, it's New York. it's not elegance and style, it is what it is.  It's what we signed on for and it's what we received.  But the footsteps overhead of Silvia's small children kept us in touch with who we are and where we were.  That part, mixed with loving tones of the family above, was sweet.[QWERTY123]We couldn't be more happier about our stay in NY. Silvia was a great host who gave us a lot of information about the places to go in the area. Since it was really cold when we arrived we were so happy about the nice temperature in the apartment. Great![QWERTY123]We are Chinese student. It was  the first time to travel New York, Silvia's house is good and her home is not far away from the city, it spent about 15min. Silvia is kind to us. When I told her about the house's coldness, she asked someone to open the thermostat on the second day. It's a good experience.[QWERTY123]Tyrome was a wonderful host, communication was great and he was very helpful and kind. The apartment is roomy, private, and close to the L train.[QWERTY123]We were very disappointed with our first airBnB experience, staying in this apartment. While Ty seems like a nice guy, and was very flexible with our check in and check out times, the place was never somewhere we could feel comfortable. Our main issue is that it was dirty. The floors were dusty and there were dust bunnies everywhere. We had to cover the futon/couch with a sheet to be able to sit as it was that dirty. The grout in the shower stall was black in places. And on the second day we started finding ans killing cockroaches in the bathroom and kitchen each day until we left. There was nothing covering the clear, ground floor bathroom window (though Ty did tack up a pillowcase when we requested it be covered). The other window coverings are sheer enough to see and be seen through. We had made the reservation with Sylvia, Ty's wife, but the listing was changed to Ty as the host prior to our arrival. We never met Sylvia. We liked the neighborhood and Ty himself, but we cannot recommend the apartment in the condition we experienced.[QWERTY123]P[QWERTY123]Tyrome's place is fantastic. Very close to cool bars and restaurants and a very short walk to different train stops to manhattan. 

Tyrome is as good a host can be. Very helpful, friendly and always responds within a few minutes. Very reliable.

And: you should check out his little gallery just next door. Very authentic and some very nice pieces of art.[QWERTY123]Had a fantastic stay in Bushwick. The apartment was beautiful, unique, and a great location. Truly a great space.[QWERTY123]Tyrome was very helpful and friendly. Was accommodating to arrival and departure times.[QWERTY123]Great stay at Tyrome's place... I found it a comfortable place. Good communication both before and during the stay. Can recommend.[QWERTY123]Great location, near to all of Bushwick's cafes, bars and restaurants and close to several subway stops. Loved the apartment's decor and furniture and it was very clean and had everything we needed. Would definitely stay here again![QWERTY123]Tyrome was a great host. Location is the heart of bushwick. I would definitely stay here again.[QWERTY123]L'appartamento è molto spazioso, pulito, con un grande bagno e una grande cucina. Si trova a 10-15 minuti circa a piedi dalle principali linee di metropolitana (J e L) e nel vicinato è presente un supermercato molto fornito. Tyrome è stato un host molto disponibile, sempre pronto a rispondere alle nostre domande.[QWERTY123]Place is very neat and tidy. Location is fantastic. Great option for NYC.[QWERTY123]Location, location, location!! This is a great spot if you want to live like a local and really experience Brooklyn. Great restaurants and bars, we met so fabulous people and loved the local delis. Ty's place is also really close to a few different subway stations that will take you right into Manhattan as well as other spots around Brooklyn and Queens. The place itself is comfortable and clean, perfect if you want to be a bit economical and prepare breakfast at home before leaving for the day. Ty lives upstairs and is a wonderful host, easy communication and gave lots of tips for local places to grab food and drinks. If you want to stay in Brooklyn don't hesitate to stay here.[QWERTY123]We had a great time staying deep in Brooklyn. This ground floor flat is conveniently situated between two subway lines (pleasant walking distance) to get into Manhattan and has plenty of local commerce to hand. Bushwick is a surprising place (art, creative, vintage, eating and drinking places) and Tyrome provides loads of useful information about it too. 
We'd recommend earplugs and eye masks so the morning school traffic doesn't awake those with jet lag but it's very quiet in the evenings and during the night. 
Good beds and a really nice space with some nice pieces of furniture in a bit of gallery style. 
Tyrome replied very efficiently to all our questions.[QWERTY123]I really enjoyed staying here, easily accessible to the L and the M and the J. Very spacious and interesting art in the apartment. It's close to a lot good restaurants and night life. I stayed here with my friends and would definitely stay here again, we loved it![QWERTY123]Check-in/check-out was super easy and flexible. The place was clean, very cozy. The neighborhoods is also one of my favorite in New York. Would rd commend[QWERTY123]This place was so wonderfully situated to markets, bakeries, restaurants, bars, and subways! We felt comfortable here, safe, and we were sad to leave[QWERTY123]Tyrome was a great host. Excellent communication and easy to work with, his place was exactly as described and was a perfect place to explore Brooklyn/NYC. There's some great bars and restaurants nearby as well, make sure to try them all![QWERTY123]Excellent host & Great location.[QWERTY123]Located in a good neighbourhood. Offers the bare necessities. Easy check in.[QWERTY123]Tyrome's place in Bushwick offers incredible value in a perfect location for exploring Brooklyn and New York. There is so much going on nearby, but it's not quite in the hectic scene so you feel safe and cozy. The apartment is very simple, but Tyrome is great and we had a great stay.[QWERTY123]Easy check in, nice place, good communication. Would stay again![QWERTY123]Great price and location![QWERTY123]My family visited me in NYC and we had a pleasant stay at Tyrome's place for a week. It's near to Manhattan and downtown Brooklyn. L and M subway stations are at a walking distance. You'll find good restaurants in Bushwick. Tyrome is a good host, we would love to visit him in future.[QWERTY123]Fantastic stay!! Tyrome was so accommodating and welcoming! His place was clean and in a great part of town. Tyrome was easy to contact and was understanding when we needed to drop our luggage off before check in. I would recommend this place to anyone wanting to experience the beauty of Brooklyn![QWERTY123]Very good address. Few block away from all the best bars, restaurants  etc[QWERTY123]The apartment is in a great location and you can walk everywhere to restaurants and coffee shops. Friendly, fun neighborhood. We would stay there again. The apartment was very clean and a comfortable bed. We enjoyed the three days we were in Bushwick![QWERTY123]Great location and great host! Comfortable and cozy place.[QWERTY123]Stayed for 5 nights, the apartment is really cute and in a great neighbourhood really close to bars and cafes and public transport. Pretty basic but clean and tidy and although we didn't need to communicate a lot Tyrome was very easy to deal with.[QWERTY123]We had a great stay. The location was convenient and the apartment was clean and comfortable. Thank you![QWERTY123]Great spot out of the hustle and bustle of Manhattan. Easy to find and get to, Tyrome was very helpful and easy to get in touch with. Great up and coming part of Brooklyn with plenty of locations/cafes/bars to explore.[QWERTY123]Super fun neighborhood, easy to get around the whole city![QWERTY123]A place we can definitely recommend! The communication and check-in / out with Tyrome were exemplary. Everything (apartment, neighborhood, etc.) was as expected. Clean apartment, nice location, close to bars, restaurants and supermarkets, with a 15-20min ride distance to Manhattan, that - due to the view on Manhattan when crossing the Williamsburg Bridge (especially when taking the L train) - was a great experience on its own. We enjoyed our stay very much![QWERTY123]Tyrome's place was perfect for us! It was close to our son's apartment, in a great, vibrant neighborhood and within walking distance to the subway. We especially appreciated the notebook with detailed info about places in the neighborhood. The space was private, roomy and clean with basic amenities.[QWERTY123]Tyrome's place was clean and spacious, and provided everything we needed for our holiday in New York.[QWERTY123]All the reviews on here are pretty spot on. Great location, good communication via Ty, check in/out is easy. The place is pretty clean, other than being a little webby. I'm used to a noisy street so it didn't bother me or my boyfriend too much. Some people had mentioned that the place is small, but I disagree. The place (technically being a basement I guess) is pretty average size for a one bedroom. I would recommend bringing your own pillow, if you are at all picky. If you plan on having any downtime in the place I would bring a laptop, especially for rainy days or settling down at night.[QWERTY123]Bushwicks best.[QWERTY123]Ty was an amazing host! The apartment was very nice, the art added a great personal touch. Also the location was phenomenal, just one quick train ride into the city.  I would definitely recommend Ty's place.[QWERTY123]We had a good stay. Tyrome's place had a great location. The neighborhood is great, some good places to eat and drink. More importantly, it's easy to catch the subway and get into Manhattan.

The place itself is pretty basic. The sheets and towels were clean, but they were pretty old.

If you are looking for a place to crash at a good value, this is the place. But if you want to spend time inside and cook and watch TV, this isn't your place.[QWERTY123]Nice place with enough room for our family...3 blocks from the metro.[QWERTY123]Great location! Very basic setup, no tv, furniture very old. Not a very comfortable stay at all for the price.[QWERTY123]This apartment is spacious, uncluttered and  so close to the awesome murals by the Bushwick Collective. Wow, that was a treat for us![QWERTY123]Great location for bars, live music and food all within minutes from the apartment. Close to Jefferson station which brings you into manhattan in about 20 minutes.[QWERTY123]Beautiful place and a great location for cool bars. Easy to get to subway stations for direct access to the rest of Brooklyn and Manhattan.[QWERTY123]Tyrome's place is in a really well located, the bustling neighborhood is awesome and we just had a great stay! Tyrome was very considerate and helpful throughout our stay.[QWERTY123]I have stayed to Tyrome's place for 10 days and I've had a really great time! The apartment is sunny, spacious and has all the amenities. The location is great because even if it's quiet there are some really cool spots for food, drinks and arts! Tyrome has been a great host with fast replies to any question, always accomodating and friendly! The suggestions he has for Bushwick are a lot and good! When I will come back to NYC I will certainly hope to come back at Tyrome's![QWERTY123]Ty’s place was the perfect landing pad for our stay in Brooklyn. Walkable to lots of local shops and restaurants and quick 10-minutes to the subway, the apartment was convenient for both Brooklyn and Manhattan exploring. Ty was super speedy to communicate with and check-in was a breeze. The artistic touches were an added plus![QWERTY123]Tyrome's apartment is lovely. The neighborhood is great. I really liked the location of the apartment and the close access to the subway.[QWERTY123]When in Brooklyn, this is the place to stay and enjoy the food, art life and old charm of Brooklyn. 
This space is perfect![QWERTY123]Need improvements[QWERTY123]Really nice and comfy place.[QWERTY123]Neat, spacious, first floor unit in a detached home. The walls contain artwork built by the owner, super neat. Very convenient, 5 minute walk to the M line which takes you directly into the heart of Manhattan, and a short 15 minute walk to the hip bars nearby.

Tyrome was very helpful with local tips, and was very accommodating to all our needs. 

Ride on, Ty![QWERTY123]If you're a tourist and looking for a bargain, this place has the basic amenities to sustain a prolonged trip. Very responsive host and easy to check in. The area is lively and the proximity of metro stations, laundromats, and grocery stores makes this an excellent home base to visit NYC from.[QWERTY123]Tyrome’s place was clean and very safe. Cool art work ![QWERTY123]Very nice apartment in a quiet and picturesque area but perfectly and quickly connected to Manhattan. 
Excellent value compared to  housing prices in New York.[QWERTY123]Very cute apartment! Convenient location, close to subways and a lot of cute restaurants/bars/shops around. Ty was quick to respond anytime I had questions and was very accommodating when we had to leave our bags for a while after checkout to kill time before our flight out. Loved the neighborhood, would definitely recommend this place.[QWERTY123]I would stay at Tyrome’s place again. It was in a great area, near restaurants and coffee shops. Also close walk to the subway. Tyrome was helpful, easy to communicate with and accommodating.[QWERTY123]This place was reasonable for its’ price. Outside of the main city, but it was not difficult to take public transit. Was about a 15 minute walk from the train station. 

The apartment is on a busy street in Brooklyn and it got pretty loud at night. The only thing that we were really bothered by was that there was no hand soap. 

All in all, this place suited our needs as we just needed a place to sleep and didn’t spend much time in the apartment. It was a much cheaper option than other places, but it wasn’t very nice.[QWERTY123]Questa sistemazione e’ ideale per una coppia giovane a cui piace esplorare quartieri vivaci è in espansione,comoda per i mezzi pubblici e pratica per i servizi intorno[QWERTY123]Loved this spot. Enough room to have a bottle of wine and dinner in when we weren’t out and about. The location is awesome for exploring Brooklyn and close to transit. Felt safe at street level, just remember that New York is a loud city :)"	40.70093129559483	-73.92608848582019	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/21293	4	105.0	0.82

Thank you Dana again to let us stay in your apartment.[QWERTY123]Great spot in a fantastic location.  Dana's description is spot on.  Her place is terrific.[QWERTY123]my stay at dana was just perfect. unfortunately i didn't meet her as she was already out of town when i got to NYC but she organized everything to get me her apartment key. i love new york and i love everything around east village - so i was more than happy to find a suitable apartment in that area. the apartment is simply perfect, it has everything you need and it's beautifully decorated plus it's very bright during the day. the bed is super comfy and it was very clean. i felt like home immediately. it's on the 4th floor - good morning and evening training :) i highly recommend dana as a host and i will be back for sure. thank you so much! Tiziana[QWERTY123]I have to say this is a tough review to write, because I know that by giving such a glowing review it decreases my chances of seeing Dana's place available again!  Dana was a fantastic host from start to finish - communication and check in was seamless.  Her place is ideal if you like the neighborhood, which I do, and don't mind the 4 floor walkup, which I appreciate.  I would highly recommend Dana's place, and hope I get to stay there in my future travels to New York.[QWERTY123]Beautiful apartment and great location. Perfect for exploring the East Village and neighbouring area. Dana was very accommodating with the dates. Thoroughly enjoyed our stay although too short![QWERTY123]Me and my son had a very great stay in Dana's apartment in late Sept 2014. It was exactly as described in her presentation and all worked out perfectly. A comfortable double-bed plus a broad couch gave us good sleep. Although we have the windows open during the nights it was very quiet and safe.
East Village is nice and perfect starting point for discover the rest of Manhattan, and the near surroundings is something to explore with small shops, bars, restaurants etc. 
Dana was perfect in her communication all the time, answered rapidly and helped us when we needed it, despite we never met her in person. 
If one need a two small room apartment in a quiet part of the town, we can highly recommend Dana's place. It's not overwhelming luxury, but you feel that you are in one's personal, nice furnitured (mostly from the 50-60th decades) home. A really good choice! Thanks for a wonderful week - even the weather was perfect![QWERTY123]We had a fantastic stay at Dana's lovely apartment.  It was really warm (which was great as it was freezing outside!), clean and spacious for two people.  Dana was really great at keeping in touch with us and was there to meet us when we arrived from the airport.  The flat is really well located in the East Village near lots of restaurants, shops and cafes and only a short 8 min walk to Union Square which has lots of metro stops and a big Whole Foods - bonus![QWERTY123]Dana is a wonderful host. Very accommodating and helpful, providing an extensive ""house manual"" with answers to every question. She is also readily available by phone or text for advice and recommendations. The neighborhood is so convenient and perfect for a NYC East Village experience. Prospective renters should know that this a fourth floor walk-up apartment. Thanks, Dana--I hope to be back soon![QWERTY123]Dana's apartment is wonderful.  Great location, beautiful furniture, and good amenities.  The internet speed is ridiculously fast!  Dana is quick to respond to requests - other AirBnBers could learn from her.[QWERTY123]Dana was an extremely gracious and responsive host, and went out of her way to make us feel welcome.  Her residence is as described, fully appointed and comfortable, and in the heart of Manhatten with ready access to all amenities and transportation.  It is perfect for a jaunt to NYC.[QWERTY123]Dana was quick to respond to emails and made the entire process smooth and easy.  The apartment is ideally located in East Village and is very quiet - especially at night.  The bed is comfortable and the apartment very functional.   I won't hesitate to book again if it's available.[QWERTY123]Dana was great to deal with. Prompt, friendly, and willing to go out of her way to make my stay in NYC great.

I stayed in her lovely and homey East Village apartment for two weeks. It was warm, quiet, with basically no neighbourhood noise at all (very rare), had a comfortable bed, a nice huge desk, a functional kitchen, and an old but very decent bathroom (especially for NYC!). The apartment is on the fourth floor - as other reviewed have noted - but is probably a good thing for those indulging themselves and needing to burn off some extra calories. The foyer is a bit dark and uninviting - especially to those who have not been in many NYC apartments - but this is standard and just the style of the original building.

The neighbourhood is vibrant and buzzing with things to see and do. A number of Momofuku eateries are barely a block away, as is a cinema, a couple of markets, coffee shops, bagel joints, Japanese restaurants, and just about anything else you could want. Most metro connections are only a short walk away and so it is trivial to get whenever you need to go.

I would happily stay with Dana again when I need a comfortable base to visit NYC.[QWERTY123]A great place in cool neighborhood. The apartment was as described and Dana was very responsive and a pleasure to deal with. There is no higher recommendation than saying that I'd definitely stay there again next time I'm in NYC if it is available. 
[QWERTY123]Great apartment in an awesome location. Plenty of room for my husband and I, and even enough space to comfortably put up our niece for a couple of nights when she came in from Brooklyn. Great decor and book collection. We arrived a little earlier than expected, but Dana was very gracious in accommodating us.[QWERTY123]Dana's place is the first one I've ever booked with Airbnb. She was helpful and easy to reach during the booking process, and gave simple and clear instructions for the stay.

The apartment is in a great neighborhood, feels very homey and is pretty quiet (which is always appreciated, even surprising, in New York). Overall it fits the given description.

In a word, would definitely book again.[QWERTY123]Dana is a great host, very communicative and helpful. We weren't able to access the internet when we first arrived and she literally dropped everything she was doing at that moment to solve the problem, fixing the issue in five minutes or less. Great spot in the East Village w/ mid-century modern decor (and yes, very quiet!) - good size for a NYC one-bdroom. The neighborhood has managed to preserve some of its authenticity, void of tourists and modern condos. Hundreds of restaurants, bars and little shops. If you want to feel removed from much hassle and bustle, but with lots to do and explore, this is the neighborhood.[QWERTY123]Dana's place was great! Creative and ""homey"" (because it's literally a designer's apartment), we found it very easy to unwind while there, get gear up for some real New York adventures. Her place felt like an extension of the amazing city we explored. 

Dana was easy to communicate with, laid back, and very accommodating. All of our dialogue was online, but we never felt like we couldn't reach out if we had a question. 

The neighbors were surprisingly quiet, which especially helpful at night. A little bit of street noise, but SO minimal to even a few blocks away. 

Note: up 4 flights of stairs. No problem for us, but just something to prepare for if you have heavy luggage, a child, or are unable to hoof it up to the 4th floor. 

Overall, great experience. Thank you Dana! You rock.[QWERTY123]Great, spacios 1 bedroom that has everything one needs in one of my favourite NYC locations. 
The place is clean, quiet and comfortable - the only thing I woul note is the walk-up to the 4th floor. That said, I would stay there again next time I hope. Thanks Dana![QWERTY123]El apartamento de Dana es muy cómodo para pasar unos días en New York. Nos facilitó en todo momento la llegada y es muy amable. El apartamento tiene de todo lo que se necesita para estar cómodo.[QWERTY123]The host canceled this reservation 2 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.[QWERTY123]The host canceled this reservation 12 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.[QWERTY123]We had such a lovely stay at Dana’s place! It was exactly as pictured but had so much more to offer. It was warm and cozy but gave us the much needed space we required as we were travelling with a toddler. Dana was so receptive and easy to contact. I would definitely recommend her place to anyone, it’s the perfect home away from home.[QWERTY123]Dana’s apartment is lovely! Clean and in a great position, close to many bars and restaurants.
The bed is super comfy and Dana is a great friendly host! Highly recommended![QWERTY123]Dana's place was fantastic - a terrific location and a stylish, comfortable space. Communication was prompt and check in/out very easy. We hope to return!"	40.72919821684685	-73.98541526041708	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/9657	3	180.0	0.816667

This place is a gem in New York, clean and neat, walking distance to all the trendy restaurants in Harlem, and most important of all, the place is warm and welcoming. Teri is a sweet and charming host; She is a lovely friend to talk to and connects to her guest from her heart.[QWERTY123]Giving it My FFF +++ :)
Even though maybe I shouldn't because I should keep it a secret ;)
Friendly (as in welcoming, good kind person)
Fresh (as in Clean) & 
Freedom (as in feeling at home) 
I'll stay with Teri ANYtime again! As a matter of fact I wanted to book another stay right away, but  to my dismay, but not to my surprise it wasn't available! Until next time![QWERTY123]Great host for my first time in the city. Lives in a bustling area just a minute's walk from a supermarket, entertainment and the A train; 10 minutes walk from Columbia University.[QWERTY123]What can I say about Teri and her perfect pad in buzzing Harlem without seeming like I'm gushing! Teri is full of gorgeous and positive energy, and so generous in the giving of her time, advice and local tips. 

The bedroom is incredibly spacious, and Teri's home is a warm reflection of the interesting and beautiful person that she is. It's situated so close to the subway, that you can be downtown Manhattan in a flash or alternatively, hang out in Harlem at the great cafes, bars and other night spots. 

I can't wait to catch up with Teri next time I'm in NYC!
[QWERTY123]Unbelievable! I haven't been in that area in a while, and the description was spot-on: it IS the best area in Harlem and I had an absolute blast. The apartment was clean, Teri was amazingly accommodating, friendly and just a beautiful person to be around, and the area offered more than I had time to explore. Just book it-it will be the best experience.[QWERTY123]I was really impressed with the friendliness of Teri and the surrounding neighbourhood.  Her home was warm, artistic and comfortable.  She made me feel welcome and like I was a friend and not just a guest.  Thanks so much Teri and all the best on your future adventures.[QWERTY123]Teri is charming for sure and just awesome overall.  The room was spacious, clean and very comfortable.  The neighborhood is also very welcoming with sidewalk cafes, nice restaurants and cool places to get a drink and listen to music within just a few blocks.  Teri's recommendations for local restaurants and coffee shops were all great.  For runners, you can start a run in nearby Morningside Park and then connect to Central Park -- you are just 10 blocks north of Central Park.  Getting around is also easy as there are subway stops just a few blocks north and south.  Columbia University and CCNY are both within walking distance.  Highly recommended.[QWERTY123]Teri is a great and welcoming host. The place is exactly as described. Its clean and neat and the location is great. There is a large closet for storing your clothing.
The apartment is quiet although you can hear the street, which really just means ""New York"" to me.
Fredrick Douglass Ave has a lot of restaurants, Morningside park and Columbia is a short walk. The 125 street subway stop is very close and have lots of options including express lines that will take you anywhere in Manhattan end beyond. 
I would stay there again and I recommend others to do the same[QWERTY123]I Absolutely loved staying here for 1 month! Teri is super friendly and easy to get along with. The apartment is clean, comfortable and in an amazing location, with the Express and local trains very close on 125th St. There is also an internal laundry, which was a nice surprise as this can be hard to find in nyc. The neighbourhood is safe and I wouldn't hesitate to stay with Teri again :)[QWERTY123]Teri was a delightful host, and the apartment was pretty much perfect for my needs. Nice area, with places to eat and a really nice supermarket nearby. I had a great time![QWERTY123]Staying with Teri was great. 
Harlem is a really interesting neighborhood to explore and everything I needed, like restaurants, grocery stores and coffee shops, were nearby the flat. 
A Metro station is also close by, so I was very fast in other parts of town.
The flat was clean and nicely decorated, my room was big, the bed comfortable.
Teri is such a nice and helpful person, I felt very welcome during my stay.
I would definitely stay there again![QWERTY123]Me and my wife were traveling in the USA on Christmas and Teri is one of the greatest people we have ever met. The room was very comfortable in a very good neighborhood with shops and restaurants. So it was a big luck to be Teri's guest.[QWERTY123]Teri is a fantastic, generous host who goes out of her way to make you feel welcome in New York! The apartment is wonderful and so is the area. Cafes and restaurants are just outside the door, there's Morningside park very close by and Central Park down the road. The apartment is also just a short walk from Columbia university - in sum a very good set up! If you are looking for a nice base from which to explore New York and would like to experience the Harlem area - don't think twice, book this place! ;-)[QWERTY123]TERY IS VERY FRIENDLY I FELT REALLI COMMFORTABLE STAYING AT HER PLACE, THE EXPERIENCE WAS MORE THAN I EXPECTED. AND THE NEIGHBORHOOD IS AWSOME!!!!!!


![QWERTY123]Teri is a great host who ensured that my stay went well. The apartment is clean and the room comfortable. The location is great and easy to get to from the airports in Newark or LaGuardia. There are plenty of eateries nearby. The subway stations along 125 street will get you anywhere in Manhattan. Morningside and Central Park are close for walks or exercise. 
This was a repeat stay and with good reason. Highly recommended.[QWERTY123]Teri made me feel welcome it felt like I had come home, her listing is accurate and the apartment is impeccable. The neighbourhood was safe and clean and I highly recommend this listing.[QWERTY123]Teri is such a great host! Always friendly and if you ask her something you'll get all information you need also she's busy. The apartment is spacious and there's all you need. Our room was also spacious with a comfortable bed and a lot of storage space. Harlem is a great place to stay. Everything is close to the apartment, metro, restaurants, bars, bestmarket. The neighborhood is safe.[QWERTY123]Nuestra estancia en casa de Teri fue maravillosa!! Su apartamento es muy acogedor, está muy bien decorado y la ubicación es perfecta. Teri es una anfitriona estupenda, muy atenta, discreta y disponible para cualquier cosa que pudiésemos necesitar. Y habla español! Volvería sin duda![QWERTY123]Teri was an amazing host, and the apartment is incredible. The description falls short to explain how comfortable and welcoming this room is. Teri's amazing taste into decoration just bring this room and the apartment to another level, a truly harlem apartment. I liked this apartment so much that I changed my travel plans to stay in New York all my stay, instead of travelling to DC after the first week. 

I staid on February, plain winter, nevertheless when I entered the apartment I had to take almost all of my winter clothes off and just keep my t-shirt, as this building central heating is just amazing.

Teri also leaves you towels and another set of bed sheets, making it really convenient for long stays. The apartment and the room are also extremely clean, and there is a lot of space for your clothes and any other luggage.

The location is perfect for travelling all around Manhattan, with the lines ABCD really close, all you have to do is just walk 3 or 4 blocks and you will be able to go almost anyway around the city. There is an amazing store 1 block away, which has EVERYTHING you might need in terms of food, no joking, it has everything you might think. I'm really picky with food, so usually for me its a challenge to find store were I can find something I can eat, but this place was amazing. There is also a smaller grocery store crossing the street, that has a very practical ATM, although there are ATMs all around, this one is really close.

This part of Harlem is really amazing, I walked alone almost everywhere around anytime after dark, and never even once saw something violent, or disturbing, or anything that made me even cross the street. The lack of big buildings is something to note, as you will most likely be able to see the sky from anywhere. Columbia University is close, and its an amazing place to visit.

You also have a cinema on 125th at USAHarlem, which present AMC movies. So whenever you had a night without plans you can just end up going to the movies.

I came here to both travel and work. I spent most of my days working, and then spent the afternoons visiting places and traveling around. My stay here was splendid, and I was able to work all day at my room, being really comfortable, as well as being able to go anywhere really quick from here. To be honest, I would have paid more for this room, is just amazing, evidently Teri's experience in Airbnb since 2009 has led her to the perfect price so I can't argue against that, I'm extremely happy with this room. Just stop looking for another place, this is the one.[QWERTY123]Teri was so sweet and welcoming, flexible and full of suggestions. The room was spacious and comfortable and she had everything you could need available. The area is so fun if you stay you should definitely take the time to explore, my favourite neighbourhood to stay in New York yet! I would come back to Teri's place without hesitation, thank you teri![QWERTY123]Thank You so much Teri!  Teri did a great job communicating quickly and helped me book a last minute trip reservation at her place.  Her apartment is very nice, well kept, and she made me feel right at home.  The bed was very comfortable and the overall experience could not have gone any better.  The neighborhood was great and was close to good coffee, food, and nightlife.  I would not hesitate to book my next trip to New York with her again![QWERTY123]Teri is really a sweet girl! She's always optimistic, reliable and sincere. She was happy to help us for any little thing during we stayed at her home! Teri's apartment is warm and delicate. She has everything we needed at home and wonderful tea. We could also use her printer! In a word, stayed in Teri's home really made us feel like at our home. We miss Teri so much. She's absolutely a nice guy!![QWERTY123]You won´t find any better in Harlem. The bedroom and bed are super comfortable and there´s a useful desk in the room for you to work, study or place your computer. The bathroom is spacious, shower works perfectly and there´s a big mirror.
Close to A express train and Columbia University. 
Teri was an amazing host. She helped me when I really needed her and it was easy to communicate with her. I would come back and I absolutely recommend it.[QWERTY123]La estancia en casa de Teri fue estupenda. Su apartamento está a menos de 10 minutos de la estación de metro de la calle 125 (lineas express y local) y a 5 minutos de la estación de metro de la calle 116 (local). Súper bien ubicado para moverse por todo Manhattan. La habitación es amplia y cómoda, con ventana, un armario amplio y una gran cajonera para poder colocar toda la ropa y el equipaje. La cama muy cómoda también. Teri es una gran anfitriona: es amable, simpática y ofrece mucha información sobre el barrio, cosas que hacer, dónde comer, etc. Ha sido una estancia muy agradable y sin duda alguna repetiría![QWERTY123]Everything was perfect. Teri is a great host![QWERTY123]Staying with Teri was truly amazing!
She sent an email with key information a few days before we arrived in NY and always gave us lots of advice on places to eat&drink. If you are planning a visit, Double Dutch coffee is the absolute best place for coffee!
The area is safe and full of amenities, including a supermarket. Very close to Central Park and subway. 125th Street is ideal if you are coming from JFK, with express A trains running every 10-15 mins (check timings on subway's website if you are travelling over the weekend).
Great chance also to spot little jazz concerts in the area and gospel choirs on Sunday.
I would definitely recommend staying at Teri's place: it will make your NY trip even more special![QWERTY123]Staying at Teri's place was amazing! 
Teri is a very nice and friendly host, and truly willing to provide advice or help. She is very familiar with the neighbourhood, and she can suggest lots of interesting and cozy places around! 
Her flat is really spacious, comfortable and well decorated, and Teri makes you immediately feel at home. 
The neighbourhood is very lively: there are plenty of bars, restaurants and shops only few steps away. Central Park and the small yet lovely Morningside Park are only few minutes walking, as well as train connections to the city centre and JFK airport. 
I really enjoyed my time at Teri's place, and I would definitely recommend it to other travellers![QWERTY123]I and my boyfriend were staying in Teri's house for 12 nights. House is great! Clean and very comfortable. Teri is very friendly and nice person. Apt. Is located in Harlem, but the area is very safe any time of the day. There are 2 subway statins very closed to the apt. One of them with express trains. That was very helpful. Also there are a lot of good stores on the 125 street very closed to the apt. Do I recommend Teri's apartment? Definitely YES![QWERTY123]Our stay at Tery's apartment was fantastic. Not only was the room clean and comfortable (the air cond was essential given the hot weather!), but also the location was very convenient to the subway and not so far from Central Park. Teri is a great host and an extremely kind person. 

We would recommend this accommodation to anyone looking for a safe and spacious place to stay in NYC.[QWERTY123]I stayed for 2 weeks at Tery's apartment and it was great. Nothing to complain about! The apartment was tidy and clean. It offered everything you need. I always felt safe in the neighborhood. No problems at all. Close by, you find supermarkets (Duane Reade, Rite Aid & 7Eleven) as well as small groceries. The subway stations (116th Street and 125th Street) are just a few minutes away from the apartment. The express trains take you -as described- within a short time to Times Square. 
In total, I can highly recommend to stay at Tery. I really enjoyed it and would to do it again if I came back to NYC for one more visit.   
Teri is a great host and always  very helpful if you have any questions   ![QWERTY123]Teri's place was fantastic. The location was convenient--a few minutes away from two subway stops and a ten minute stroll from Columbia's campus. The room has a super comfortable bed, a big closet and chest of drawers, and AC. Teri was very helpful with anything I needed. Overall I had a great stay in her apartment![QWERTY123]Her place is very cozy and safe and clean!!![QWERTY123]Everything was accurate, Teri is a wonderful host! Her apartment is cosy and welcoming in a gentrified safe neighbourhood and is ideal for getting around in Manhattan as it is located 2 blocks from the 125th St Subway. Would go back in a heartbeat![QWERTY123]Teri was lovely, relaxed and great to chat too. The apartment is a 5 minute walk from the subway A train downtown to Times Square, Empire State etc, and local to shops. The apartment is close to the hop on, hop off tour bus near Apollo theatre. There is a supermarket 2 blocks away. The room was decent sized and had good storage. We were very pleased we could use the kitchen and store food in the fridge. Apartment was tidy and we were given everything we needed. The only downside is the neighbourhood is extremely noisy with locals, traffic and sirens. The local shop assistants later told us the neighbourhood is dangerous and not to go out night.[QWERTY123]Teri was nice and friendly. She went out of her way to assist me with questions I had about where to eat and directions. She provided her suggestions when solicited.[QWERTY123]La casa es tal cual lo que ves en el anuncio, hermosa! El cuarto es grande con un escritorio para poder trabajar (en mi caso). Es una buena zona, con muchas familias, las estaciones de metro están a menos 8 cuadras y llegas al centro en poco tiempo. Teri fue lo mejor de estar allí, me hizo sentir como en casa, muy amable y atenta, siempre con una sonrisa. Genia!! Sin dudarlo me quedaría allí nuevamente.[QWERTY123]We had a very nice stay in Teri's flat in Harlem. The room was comfortable and clean and Teri was a great host. Thanks![QWERTY123]Nous avons passé une très bonne semaine dans l'appartement de Teri. 
La chambre est spacieuse et l'appartement idéalement situé dans Harlem. La chambre était propre mais la salle de bains aurait pu être plus propre. 
Sinon la localisation a 5min du métro et proche de nombreux restaurant et commerces nous a beaucoup plus. 
Teri est quelqu'un de très gentille et attentionnée. Nous recommandons. 
[QWERTY123]The apartment is more beautiful than photos show. We were very satisfied and we felt like at home. Teri is a very positive person :-) Thank you that we could be your guests.[QWERTY123]I stayed at Teri's place for two months in October-November, and I could not recommend this place more. The apartment itself is lovely. A spacious living room, and the bedroom is plentiful in size, with a simply magnificent bed. If you need to get a bit of work done, theres a table and chair, along with flawless wifi. Theres heating for the cold seasons (I needed that) and there also seems to be an air conditioner in the room too. Of course ideally you will want to be exploring the city, but for the times you want to have a lazy day, the apartment and room will serve you marvellously.

Teri is an absolutely fantastic host, and could not be more helpful and kind. On my first night here, she helped me settle in and even bought a bottle of wine from the downstairs wine store to make me feel even more welcome. She's an amazing host, and an even more amazing person.

The area is simply wonderful for living in the city. Some fantastic bars and restaurants just a few blocks away. Far too many to name them all. A supermarket equally close with everything you would ever need, and express trains down to mid-town and beyond at just 125th. The area is safe, lively, and an exciting place to be if you're looking for that NYC feeling.

Honestly, I could not have asked for more from my stay here. If you were even a little bit on the fence about whether to stay here or not, then I hope that I have been able to persuade you to put aside any uncertainties.[QWERTY123]Teri is an absolutely great host, warm and easygoing. I had nice discussions with her, got tips for restaurants and traveling in NYC. The room was good and the building was clean and felt safe. Traveling in Manhattan was easy and the subway stops were close.[QWERTY123]This was my second time staying at Teri's home and I absolutely loved booking her place! Teri's home is spacious and the location is perfect for the express subway trains! I was happy to catch up with Teri again, as she's always good fun & it feels more like staying with a good friend! I look forward to hopefully visiting again in the future :)[QWERTY123]Teri es una persona muy amable y siempre estaba preocupada para ver si nos hacia falta algo.
La ubicación es muy buena y la habitación es muy acogedora.
Lindo lugar!![QWERTY123]Very nice place to stay![QWERTY123]It is a ver nice and spacious house! In a very beautiful and funny street, very safe and with Train express to midtown very fast! Teri is a very nice person and She is often away so you have the house only for you! In the gode there are all home appliances! And there is also a garden on the back of the building! All my experience ess great![QWERTY123]Adorei minha estadia com Teri (27 dias).O apartamento é ótimo, bem localizado e confortável. Teri é amavel e solicita! Me senti bem (Website hidden by Airbnb) certeza indico seu espaço, e espero ter a oportunidade de voltar lá![QWERTY123]Teri is very sweet and easy to talk to! Teri made my stay comfortable by offering me full reign of the kitchen and apartment in general, recommending different places, asking me about my days, and giving me advice about traversing the city. Her apartment is quite safe, close to great coffee shops, restaurants, and bars, has a conveniently located supermarket within two blocks, and is also two blocks away from Morningside Park as well. The individuals within her building were also very sweet and friendly. Overall, loved staying in Harlem in Teri's apartment![QWERTY123]Teri was an amazing host! She saved us a lot of time by making sure we knew all the best places in the area to tour and eat. Her place was also very clean and warm. We felt at home. We enjoyed every second of our stay, and we would definitely stay again![QWERTY123]Very nice stay in Teri's apartment which is located on the 8th avenue in Harlem at a very walking distance from the subway (with the A line - express - 15 minutes from down-town Manhattan and also many other lines). We had a private large room with a comfortable bed plus a private bathroom at the opposite side of the hallway and could also use the kitchen to make some cooking and we did it a few times ! Same with the living room when Teri wasn't there and did it too. We had nice talks with her even if we didn't met so often because NYC is an amazing city where there is so much to do. Thanks Teri ! We highly recommend Teri's room.[QWERTY123]This was a perfect place for me to spend a week! The apartment was beautiful and comfortable. The location was great- an easy walk to the subway, close to anything I needed. Teri was easy to communicate with and I'd definitely consider booking with her for my future stays in NYC![QWERTY123]Terri provided a lot of useful information before arrival. 
She's a very friendly person and we definitely enjoyed staying at her place.
The communication was perfect even if we had time differences.[QWERTY123]Terri is awesome ! She makes you feel right at home and her appt is so cozy. The appt is near the subways, local restaurants, and bars . Go with Terri she was a great host! 

This was me and my husbands first Airbnb and she made it an unforgettable experience.[QWERTY123]The host canceled this reservation 7 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.[QWERTY123]Teri was an excellent host!  Her place is in Harlem, in a great neighbourhood close to the top of Central Park and convenient to the A and C trains. It is also close to the Apollo Theater and stores and restaurants. Teri provided suggestions for restaurants, coffee bars and also an excellent grocery store just up the street. The sunny bedroom was spacious with a queen-size bed and dresser, plus a desk and chair. I had access to a kitchen, a livIng room, and a washer/dryer. It was a great stay thanks to Teri’s hospitality![QWERTY123]She is a amazing host! Excellant communitcation and the room is in great condition. Thanks again Teri[QWERTY123]I had a fantastic time staying in Teri’s very stylish apartment.

It's a super convenient location and the apartment itself is very comfortable and cozy! Teri makes you feel right at home. She is super kind and welcoming! It was my first time in the city and she made me feel right at home. The neighborhood is lovely and safe- close to restaurants, public transportation and the park. My only complaint is that I couldn't stay longer![QWERTY123]Teri是一个特别热情､可爱和善解人意的女生,浑身充满活力,特别友善,我出门很冷的时候她还会借衣服帽子手套给我,真的非常感谢她在我居住期间对我的关怀!她的房间装潢漂亮,家具设备一应俱全,厨房有各种厨具,床非常柔软舒适,离116街地铁和125街地铁有6分钟走路路程,好多辆地铁通过,非常方便,晚上也很安全,唯一不足的是沿马路,早上窗口有点汽车声音,不过我这个问题可以解决｡[QWERTY123]Eu e minha prima ficamos no apartamento da Teri por duas semanas. Teri é uma ótima pessoa e foi muito gentil e disponível conosco. O check in foi tranquilo, pudemos deixar nossas malas antes do horário de entrada e também contamos com flexibilidade no horário de saída. O apartamento é muito bom, nos sentimos muito à vontade para usar a cozinha, geladeira, fogão e etc. Foi como ficar na casa de uma amiga que mora longe. Adoramos a localização, metrô muito próximo, supermercado e bons bares e cafeterias ao redor.[QWERTY123]Logement bien situé dans un quartier calme de Harlem, près de toute commodité tant sur le plan des transports que des commerces.
Teri nous fait partager ses bonnes adresses.[QWERTY123]Teri is a great host, we were able to communicate well since before booking our stay!!
Also, her apartment is well located, in a nice neighborhood and close to subways and buses that can take you to downtown in less than 20min!!
We would definitely recommend for anyone looking for a long stay in New York!![QWERTY123]Location was excellent and Teri was able to accommodate me on a short notice which I truly appreciate. Very hospitable and a great hostess!![QWERTY123]The host canceled this reservation 23 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.[QWERTY123]I stayed in Teri’s apartment for 5 weeks and never once did I regret my decision. Her place is extremely warm and welcoming and nearby everything one might need. The location is bested only by the host’s lovely personality. I highly recommend Teri’s  to anyone visiting the city.[QWERTY123]El apartamento de Teri está muy bien ubicado si el motivo de la visita tiene que ver con la universidad de Columbia. Si no es el caso, la zona está perfectamente conectada con el resto de la ciudad por líneas de metro a pocos minutos. 
La casa es acogedora y está decorada con gusto. La habitación en que me quedé es espaciosa; estaba limpia, ordenada -igual que el baño- y disponía de una cama amplia y cómoda. 
Teri es una excelente anfitriona, amable, atenta y rápida en las respuestas. Le volvería a pedir alojamiento sin duda.[QWERTY123]nice place to stay and secure. Close to Metro stations. Teri will make your stay as easy as possible, really nice easy going person. 
[QWERTY123]Value for money. Terri wasn't there during our stay but she was accessible via phone for all our question and needs. The apartment is very cozy and safe. The bed is super comfortable.  I would definitely recommend this place to everyone. It's a few mins walk to the subway. And if you take the A train, its only 2 stops from Times Square. I will definitely use Terri again in the future. Loved it.[QWERTY123]Great location! Very personable and helpful host! If we return to NYC, we’ll be checking Teri’s space availability first.[QWERTY123]The host canceled this reservation 31 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.[QWERTY123]Teri's apartment is super nice and cozy. We felt like being at home there and we had everything we need. Thanks to the comfortable bed we were able to recover after our long days of 15+ kilometers of walking. Teri is super host as well. She's been always enthusiastic to get to know us better and to give us some tips and tricks for our stay in the city. It's a pity we were so busy and tired and we couldn't spend more time with her. I highly recommend this airbnb.[QWERTY123]Teri was a perfect host and her house is in the best neighbourhood to visit NY: close to the metro and central Park, in a very quiet street. I've just spent two days but I feel like I ve found a home in NY: thank you Teri! PS: for Italian guests, she understand Italian perfectly![QWERTY123]We had a wonderful stay at Teri’s. She is very easygoing and she really cares about having her guests confortable. The localization is perfect. And she gave us all the orientation we needed. The keys delivery was very easy.

Place was great we barley used it unless to sleep and shower. Location was perfect especially the train station[QWERTY123]Our experience with Teri was great. The apartment has a wondeful location, close to express and local subway stations, great restaurants and the neighborhood is safe anytime. Teri has great hints on what to do, eat and go.

71	21456	"We had a delightful stay at Dana's fantastically located apartment.  It was just perfect for our needs -- tidy and cozy!  She's a completely gracious, welcoming hostess -- provided clean linens and even some croissants for our breakfast! ^*^ An easy walk to the subway and the Natural History Museum. Within a beautiful 20-minute stroll across the park to museums.  I hope we can forge a lasting friendship![QWERTY123]Dana's place is charming, and very well-located just a block away from the Great Hill in Central Park.  She provided clean linens and towels, as well as access to her very cute kitchen.  The place was clean and quiet - perfect for a weekend getaway.  No internet as of my stay, but she said she'd be getting it very soon.

It was super-easy to get from here to the various museums by train (esp the Museum of Natural History) or by walking through the Park.  

Dana definitely thought of the details, and we felt quite welcome.  I'd definitely stay here again![QWERTY123]great stay, i would recommend her anytime...[QWERTY123]Dana is a warm and welcoming host.  We enjoyed our stay at her apartment.  The apartment is clean, comfortable and conveniently located near Central Park, many restaurants, stores and is a short walk to the Metro.[QWERTY123]Dana was a very gracious host. The apartment was clean and comfortable. A great overall experience![QWERTY123]Great stay--My many thank yous! Everything was comfortable and very clean.Fabulous location! I look forward to my next NYC excursion![QWERTY123]Dana was really helpful. The apartment is in a great spot. its nice and clean. Good access to the metro stations and a bus route passes the door on route to/from downtown to Haarlem. Central park 1 minutes walk away and a good drinkers bar around the corner (called ding dong) and one of the best breakfast deli place 2/3 mins by foot called Zanny's. Great place for a long week end.[QWERTY123]Dana and her place were great.  She was very welcoming and helpful.  The apartment was perfect - clean, comfortable, and well located. I really enjoyed my stay. I would definitely recommend Dana and her apartment.[QWERTY123]Good location. Close to Central Park, the subway, small supermarkets and great breakfast place (Zanny's). Seems like a nice neighbourhood. Quiet and clean apartment with wireless internet. Comfortable bed and sofa in separate rooms. Dana was very helpful answering our questions about transportation, location and the apartment when we were planing and packing for the vacation. When we arrived there was a nice welcoming letter with recommendations of places to eat and drink. And she had put together a stack of information material about NY and events close by. Thanks - we had a great time :)[QWERTY123]What a wonderful experience!!!  Dana was very helpful and friendly and made us both feel right at home. New York was a big treat and the location was perfect!! If you ever find yourself in NYC and need to stay somewhere, this place has it all. Very cozy and welcoming. I highly recommend.

Brendan[QWERTY123]Dana and her apartment were perfect.  The place is clean and charming.  Location was a nice break from some downtown places we have stayed.  Quiet, very close to Central park and good food, but also very convenient to get to other points in Manhattan.[QWERTY123]What about Dana? She was great even if she wasn't there!!!!
My girlfriend and I stayed at her place for Xmas holidays (during the blizzard...), she told us she'll not be in NY during our stay but everything was prepared when we arrived.
The house is exactly what we wanted and it is a perfect match to the description on the website; good location and the bus stop on the street is a great solution for who doesn't like to walk (30 min to Columbus Circle)
No more to say, just go there and enjoy the City!![QWERTY123]Dana's place is GREAT and very well-located just a block away from Central Park. Close to the subway, small supermarkets and whole food market. Dana also provided clean linens and towels.
She was very helpful and friendly. Our flight was delayed and she was waiting for us in the apartment. Unfortunately we didn't have a chance to meet her again but she contacted us if everything was fine. We would definitely recommend her. Thanks Dana![QWERTY123]Dana's little apartment on the upper west side is lovely! It was the perfect location for visiting Columbia University and only two blocks from several subway lines. Dana kindly left a map for us, as well as restaurant and bar recommendations for places near by. I wouldn't hesitate to stay at Dana's place next time I'm in New York![QWERTY123]We had a wonderful stay in NY over Easter weekend. We arrived in the middle of work day so Dana's schedule prohibited her from meeeting us at the apartment. Being the thoughtful person she is, she went ahead and mailed us the key a head of time. When we arrived we were greeted with fresh fruit, a hand written note welcoming us to NYC, and maps of local attractions. The apartment is a mere 3 blocks to the#1 subway and I think right about the same distance for the B train. It is also only one block to the wonderful Central Park.
The apartment is perfect for 1 to 2 people to stay in and we had absolutly no issues while there. If you are going to NYC, stay at Dana's![QWERTY123]We had a very satisfying week in NYC. Dana was a very good host and the apartment was what we needed. It is a small apartment but you are out all day and do not need any larger rooms. The area is quiet and there are a lot of local shops to use for the most vitals stuff you need. Transportation to and from the apartment is easy with lots of options for buses and subways. 
There is a TV but only with a couple of working channels. It would have been nice to have a few more but it is no big problem since watching TV is not a prioritized activity when you get into New York.  Internet worked without problems.
We would definitely consider using this apartment again and recommend it to others.[QWERTY123]We enjoyed our stay at Dana's place. It was clean and cozy and an easy walk to Central Park and the Subway. Some things that stood out: Comfortable bed. Excellent internet connection. Always plenty of hot water and good water pressure for showering. Lots of natural light. 

We didn't meet Dana in person, but she was a very welcoming host who left us a list of restaurant recommendations and tips about the apartment (how the lock for the bathroom door worked, etc.) She was always quick to respond to any questions. 

If you are looking for a nice little place to come home to after a long day of seeing the city, Dana's apartment is great.[QWERTY123]Dana's place is clean and cosy and an easy walk to Central Park (one block away) and also to the Subway (# 1 and C trains) and bus stops. It has a comfortable bed and clean linen and towels are provided. The area is quiet and there are small supermarkets nearby.  Dana had kindly mailed me the key a head of time. I was arriving late in the evening which prevented her from meeting me at the apartment but when I arrived I found a thoughtful hand written welcoming note as well as maps and guides. It was good to come back to the apartment after a long day of sightseeing around the city – especially as Dana had thoughtfully placed some cool beers in the fridge. Much need during the heatwave week in early June! I would recommend Dana’s place to any single or couple coming to visit New York City.[QWERTY123]It was a great stay in Dana's apartment.
Alberto & Federica[QWERTY123]A great place to stay - just what we were looking for. A cosy, sunny apartment just a couple of minutes from Central Park and with lots of charm. The area has a nice easy-going atmosphere, and people have time  tto talk and make contact. A great pleasure to get a good night's sleep in a quieter area after the hectic energy of downtown.That said, the area has lots to offer in terms of restaurants and shops and two subway lines are minutes away. The big museums - the Met and the Guggenheim can be reached by taking a pleasant stroll through the Park. Dana met us when we arrived, and it was immediately clear how the special welcoming atmosphere of her apartment is closely linked to her open, and friendly manner. Don't hesitate to reserve this place if you get a chance ![QWERTY123]As this was our first experience using airbnb, we were cautiously optimistic going into our first rental.  Dana made the experience a completely positive one and we can't wait to do it again!  She communicated quickly to our query, mailed us a key and left a nice bottle of wine and a welcome note for us for our arrival on Christmas Day (she was away visiting family).  The apartment is cozy, quiet and comfortable and in a great location!  She made us feel right at home.
Thanks Dana![QWERTY123]This is a nice apt on a quiet side street near Central Park and Columbia Univ.  Dana is a great host, and our stay could not have been better.

The bedroom is very quiet, facing the rear of the bldg; however, the radiator makes all kinds of weird noises throughout the night, so if you're not a very sound sleeper, you may be awakened by this. 

But, the bed was very comfortable, the kitchen and livingroom caught the bright morning sun, and the neighborhood was great.  We'll come again!

[QWERTY123]Apartment is great, very close to two metro station, and is perfect for a couple.
It is full of light and its exactly as appears in the photos. We spent a great time and we get used to the neighborhood very fast, we used to arrive very late at night (1AM) and we never was afraid of the area.
Dana is a very highly recommended HOST, she was waiting for us, so she did a lot of recommendations and she helped us with a lots of tips. 
Thanks for everything!!![QWERTY123]We were very well received, accommodation was perfect, we were able to enjoy all its amenities. The room was very quiet, the apartment is well arranged. The metro is near so convenient to the center of Manhattan. Dana is very attentive to the smallest requests. Thank you we spent a very pleasant stay.[QWERTY123]Dana was such an amazing host!
She was very kind and took the time to give us a lot of tips about the city and the local area.
The apartment was very cute, cozy and comfortable and in a prefect location, very close to the subway.
We had a fabulous holidays, I really recommend it!
Thank you so much Dana![QWERTY123]The apartment is simple, but very charming and has everything we need. It is very near Central Park and subway and buses. There are stores in front where you can buy food and lots of things.
Dana is a wonderful hostess! She gave us all the instructions about the keys, lights, bathroom, places to visit, buses and subways we had to use...She is really friendly![QWERTY123]We are very happy with our stay! You get exactly what you see in photos - nice and cozy apartment with everything you need. 
The Central Park is just few steps down the street, metro station and few grocery shops are close - so it's a very good location. 
This was our first experience with airbnb and we're really satisfied with it![QWERTY123]It was our first time in NYC, the appartement is gorgious, you really feel like a New Yorker :) the area is great u literally walk on Columbus Avenue - 50min later you hit Timesquare, Broadway. Also 2 close subways close by and of course central park just a couple of minutes away - only one word - AMAZING - Dana was a brilliant host. Thank you Dana[QWERTY123]What a wonderful time we had. The apartment was perfect for experiencing living like a New Yorker. Very clean, tidy and thankfully air conditioned! It was always a pleasure to come back to the apartment after a long day of walking across the city.

Danna was a perfect host. She left us clear and complete instructions and very useful tips. Overall an excellent experience.

Thanks Danna![QWERTY123]This was our first trip to NYC and the first time using AIRBNB and it was a good experience overall. Dana was a great host and provided us with a lot of useful information about the area. There are two metro stops within 3-4 blocks of the apartment and Central Park is only one block away. Bus stops are also located near the apt. Dana was kind enough to let us use her computer and printer to make reservations and print tickets for our planned events. I would definitely recommend anyone going to NYC to stay at Dana's apt! Thanks!![QWERTY123]It was my first trip in New York ans the second time for the friend who were with me. It was so wonderful for us to visit this amazing city. And to be in Dana's place was really great cause it's a really pleasant appartment, really clean ans cozy, it's really well located to live as a new-yorker. Dana is a perfect host and even if we didn't see her for a long time she's nice, pleasant and really helpful.
Thanks a lot Dana, you were perfect![QWERTY123]The reservation was canceled 20 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.[QWERTY123]We had a great time at Dana's place and really enjoyed our time in NY! 

[QWERTY123]We had a great experience at Dana's place.  We arrived in New York at a time when Dana wasn't available to greet us, so she went out of her way to leave a key for us to pick up, left us a really nice letter greeting us and telling us all about her place and left us with guides to the city and maps.  It was great.  Location is AWESOME with the subway a couple blocks away and central park one block away.  So great![QWERTY123]Dana was such an amazing host.  This was not my first time in NYC but it was my first time as the main guest for an Airbnb apt.  If all my Airbnb experiences are like this one I will surely be using Airbnb for a long time.  Before arriving our communications were very prompt and clear. I arrived to her place with my friend and Dana was hospitable and very nice.  Her place although not large (which I know is very typical for NY apartments) it is clean and efficient.  I couldn't ask for a better location (It is a quiet street but within a two to four minute walk to Central Park, the subway, 24 hour mini store and all night restaurants)  I would happily stay here the next time I'm in NY!  A great start to a great vacation!  :-)
[QWERTY123]Great location and nice appartment ! 
We had a great time at Dana's place, I recommend this appartment.[QWERTY123]The flat is in an very good location close to central park and to the metro....Dana is really nice...I had some problem with the bathroom and she was very helpful....I guess that now the problem is solved![QWERTY123]While we didn't get to meet Dana on our arrival she was always available and responsive via email.   Dana left us tips and directions and items of specific interest.   Acquiring the keys was easy.    A backup contact was provided but never needed.   The apt was as described.  It was small but clean and comfortable.   Coming back to a nice quiet part of the City after being in the mix was very welcome.    Loved being close to Central Park, enjoying the walk past on the way to/from the subway.    I definitely recommend a stay at Dana's.[QWERTY123]Even though Dana was out of town, she made my employee's stay a positive and easy one.  Would definitely recommend for anyone considering staying here.[QWERTY123]It was a very pleasant journey. The flat is really near central park (2mn walking) and the subway. The flat is really clean. It's a little cosy flat and calm. It's easy to communicate with Dana[QWERTY123]My boyfriend and I had an amazing time in New York, Dana's place was definitely a huge part of that. Her apartment was small, but in a great location and it has all we needed. A comfortable bed and a nice shower was all we needed and that's exactly what we got. Dana sadly couldn't be there to hand over the keys but she was great, she had left a letter describing everything for us and checked her email everyday in case we needed anything or had any troubles. Her place is in a very easy to get to location with a subway very close by going right to the centre. Also it's right next to central park which is great to walk around in! I would recommend Dana's place to anyone![QWERTY123]Hello, 

I first would like to take this opportunity to thank Dana for being such a great host.

Dana was there when I arrived to greet me, she showed me around the apartment that was clean and very welcoming. Had some information about the area, restaurants and helpful information about the city. The location of her apartment is great, felt very safe to walk the street at night, and plenty restaurants in close proximity.

If you are looking for a small place to rest your head as you explore New York, this is a perfect place for you.

Thanks,

Jaja[QWERTY123]Charmant petit appartement situé dans un quartier résidentiel tranquille, à l'extérieur de l'agitation du centre. Vie de quartier très appréciable avec ses marchés et restaurants (l'italien juste en face de la maison est exceptionnel). Dana est une hôte remarquable, très accueillante, généreuse et aidante. Le logement comprend une cuisine plutôt petite pour qui aimerait beaucoup cuisiner, mais il est authentique, chaleureux et confortable. Nous le recommanderions à quiconque.[QWERTY123]Dana's apartment was perfect for my fiancé and our son. It was comfortable and clean, I would definitely recommend this apartment for a weekend stay in the city. Very close to Central Park and the subways.[QWERTY123]Dana is such a lovely person and our stay at hers wouldn't be better! 
I really recommand Dana's place to everyone who is looking for real nice and human contact while looking for Airbnb accommodation.
The location is perfect...very quiet and safe...we just felt like the same way as New Yorkers :-)
Thanks a lot Dana, you were our best Airbnb experience :-D[QWERTY123]This apartment is a great place to stay while visiting NYC. Perfect location, close to central park and 2 subway lines. Plenty of places to eat around. Great value for money. I haven't had a chance to meet Dana but she gave clear information how to get into the apartment.[QWERTY123]The host canceled this reservation 40 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.[QWERTY123]Dana is a great host, kind and precise. The apartment is lovely and well located in a nice and calm neighborhood just few steps away from  central park and subway. 
We have got a minor problem with the bathroom but it has been sort out thanks to the host.[QWERTY123]Très bien[QWERTY123]Dana's place was a great homebase for my stay in NYC. Easy to visit everything on the UWS, safe, clean and quiet! I didn't hear any street noise or neighbors, which is a real find in the city. Would absolutely stay here again. :)[QWERTY123]It was a great experience staying at Dana's place. It is in a great location between Central Park and Broadway. There are lots of great restaurants nearby (I highly recommend the eggs benedict from Manchester Diner). The place was quite large for the price, with a living room, kitchen, bathroom, and bedroom. Everything was clean and Dana was great with communication.[QWERTY123]We really liked the apartment. The bed was comfortable and the area surprisingly calm at nights. The locality is convenient (subway quite close) and we felt safe all the time.  Communication with Dana was perfect.[QWERTY123]Great place!  Easy location!  Would definitely stay here again.  Everything we needed was there.[QWERTY123]We really enjoyed staying at Dana's place. The subway was close which made getting around easy. Dana met us at checkin and gave some great tips on the neighborhood. The apartment was clean and had everything you could need for the stay. Would definitely stay here again![QWERTY123]Dana’s place was the perfect crash pad for my Mom and I on our recent trip to New York. It’s in a great location – close to the subway and a stone’s throw from Central Park. Dana was lovely and very accommodating and we felt right at home during our stay![QWERTY123]Todo perfecto. Dana siempre en comunicación, nos estaba esperando, excelente anfitriona, a tres cuadras del departamento está la estación de subte linea B que solo funciona hasta las 22 hs. y no circula sábados ni domingos pero hay dos lineas de buses en la esquina que conecta sin problemas.  Muy buena estadía en casa de Dana.[QWERTY123]Dana's apartment was in a fantastic location, right by the park and very close to a subway. It was very clean, and she accommodated to us with an early check-in. Great experience ![QWERTY123]The host canceled this reservation 9 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.[QWERTY123]Great location, great place, great host![QWERTY123]The host canceled this reservation 40 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.[QWERTY123]Dana‘s place was the perfect getaway at the end of long days walking around Manhattan. It was cozy and clean and charming, just what we needed to put our feet up at the end of the day. It’s very close to the subway, just several blocks  away, which made transportation so easy. Also extremely close to Central Park, for early-morning runs or walks.

Dana greeted us when we arrived and left us some pastries as a welcome treat. She was very easy to communicate with and answered some questions for us before and during our trip, which was very helpful.

Overall we loved her apartment and would definitely consider coming back.[QWERTY123]We booked Dana’s place for our international guest who came to NY for few weeks and couldn’t be happier that we chose this place. She is a great host and our guest was delighted and very happy. Thank you Dana![QWERTY123]Fin lejlighed med rolig beliggenhed i den nordvestlige del af byen. Kort afstand til Central Park - fine restauranter og kiosker/små butikker i nærheden. 3 blokke fra nærmeste metro.[QWERTY123]Perfect place to stay to experience living in NY. We loved the location. Dana is super nice and has some delicious food recommendations. Especially Silver Moon bakery is yummie. Thanks for your hospitality Dana, we had a great time![QWERTY123]Dana's apartment is perfectly situated right next to the Central Park, bus stops are right across the house and the subway just around the corner. Dana is a great host, she was very helpful with tips for shops, restaurants etc. in the neighbourhood and gave us a website to find a place to store our luggage on the day of departure. The apartment is the perfect size for two people, I spent 8 great days with my mum in New York.[QWERTY123]Dana' host is located in a comfortable neighborhood in Upper West side, close to park and subway. She has helped a lot to make us comfortable in her home quite well.[QWERTY123]Doesn't look like the place was cleaned before we came. Bring your own linens and towels. The location was great for our stay.[QWERTY123]Dana's place was smaller than we expected. The apartment was very clean when we arrived and the scent upon entering was very welcoming. Her check in and check out times were very flexible. She responded to our queries immediately and she even assisted us to get a cab from 42nd Street where the airport shuttle left us.
Even tho we stayed over a week at her apartment, it wasn't a bother for her any at all.
The bus stop was a doorstep away and the buses operate 24hrs everyday which was a huge plus. The subway is just 3 blocks away which took 10 mins or less to get to 42nd street. The access to transportation was a huge plus for us. There are also quite a few Deli's which was so convenient for us.

The neighborhood is very quiet and there were no outside noise when we are sleeping[QWERTY123]Real-world NY apartment, great value. Interesting stretch of Columbus Ave and so close to the park.[QWERTY123]Ideal location! Small and cosey, host is responsive and very helpful![QWERTY123]Great location, close to amenities. Great
Restaurants nearby. Thoroughly enjoyed our stay.[QWERTY123]Great homebase for the UWS. Small but quiet. Nice and close to Central Park, Columbia and Riverside Park.  Convenient to subway.  Dana was very responsive and helpful.  Wonderful stay overall.[QWERTY123]Dana is great, has great communication! Apartment is secure and cute! All the amenities you need (including hair dryer, iron, etc.) great location a short walk to Central Park and a few local bars and restaurants near by! Highly recommend.[QWERTY123]Great place, great apartment, ideal for any stay in the city[QWERTY123]O apartamento da Dana foi ótimo para nós! Excelente localização ao lado do Central Park, perto do metro, de bares e locais para um excelente café da manhã. Dana foi uma ótima anfitriã, nos deu dicas e fez com que nos sentíssemos em casa, foi uma ótima experiência.[QWERTY123]Dana’s place is exactly as she describes in airbnb, the place is about 3 blocks from the station and the area is safe. We walk everyday without any trouble and the building is really clean.

73	21794	"Olan is a nice guy. Great host. 
Great location. 
Great stay.[QWERTY123]Olan was a tremendous host. First, I'd like to highlight that Olan puts the breakfast in AirbnB. He made breakfast for me each morning of my stay (3 days), even when I was inconsistent and late about being awake at the time I said I would (sorry Olan!). Of course, I can't guarantee he's available/willing to do that always, but it really was a boost to my spirit to start exploring NYC on a full stomach each day! Second, the space itself is great. I stayed in the first room on the left, which had a great lofted bed (very comfortable) with plenty of space to store my clothes, etc. The bathroom was also very convenient.
Third, the location is obviously wonderful: right on the ACE line and less than 5 minutes from the 123. And right next to Chelsea Market where I found myself everyday of my stay. Can't say enough good things about Olan and would happily stay again![QWERTY123]Olan was a fantastic host! He was excellent in his communication before and during the stay. And, upon arrival he presented me with a lovely basket of goodies- I felt so welcome! I felt very comfortable just hanging out with Olan and chatting, and also running off to explore the city.He was considerate and checked in on me during my stay in NYC to make sure I was doing well and having fun.  All in all, a very positive experience![QWERTY123]Olan tirelessly works to ensure his guests are welcome.  I have met few people who are as thoughtful and considerate as him.  One of my favourite touches was that he arranged beautiful plates of fresh fruits that I would find waiting for me when I came back. He was extraordinarily knowledgeable about Chelsea and New York--he could always answer any questions that I had.  He is gregarious and possesses keen insight into many topics. The conversations I had with him were always extremely insightful. His home is beautifully decorated with an eclectic collection of art (many of which are his!).
The apartment was always kept very clean and Olan was always sure to ask if I needed anything. I had a great time hanging out with his dog Al and cat Tux.  I think anybody staying here will feel as though they have a second home away from home.  I had an excellent summer![QWERTY123]I had a wonderful time staying at Olan's place<3 I felt like at home, my room was super cosy with clean towels and plenty of snacks and beverages in my private fridge. I already miss him and so does my dog! Thank you so much Olan![QWERTY123]Olan was the best host ever! Before my arrival he was already asking me for my preferences to make sure I had everything I needed on my arrival. He replied almost instantly to all my messages. And even after, every day he would make everything was good, often showing up with some tea and treats. And what to say about the amazing breakfast he would prepare for me? Very tasty! Other two little friends were around the flat making me smile all the time! I had a very nice stay, was traveling alone, but I felt home from day 1! Thank you Olan, Big Al (dog) and Tuxie (cat) for being so welcoming! The room is exactly as described, is warm and cosy, and sleeping up there made me feel like in a cocoon! The position is great, in the middle of Manhattan, 1 minute from the Tube and 1 minute from the Chelsea market (where you can find all different kind of food). Overall I had a great experience![QWERTY123]最高のﾎｽﾄです!!♡
今回はﾆｭｰﾖｰｸのｶｳﾝﾄﾀﾞｳﾝ旅行で利用しました!
初めてのB&Bで不安しかなかったのですが､ﾒｯｾｰｼﾞのやり取りから優しく丁寧に対応をしてくれました!
朝ごはんも美味しいし､紅茶もいつも入れてくれるし本当に大満足です!!
お部屋はｶﾗﾌﾙで可愛く､2人で過ごしても十分な広さです!:)♡
お部屋にDVDもたくさんありたくさん見ることが出来たのもよかったです♡
本当にOlanのおかげで最高のNY旅になりました!
Thank you Olan!
If I'll go to the New york.
I'm surely stay olan house!
See you again!!♡♡[QWERTY123]Staying at Olan's was absolutely fantastic!  Olan was warm, welcoming, and super accommodating.  He served breakfast in bed.  Full stop.  He's also quite talkative and has a ton going on as an artist/actor.

The digs were super cozy and well, well stocked with yummy treats like fruit and candy.  His movie collection is extensive, and his pets are really friendly.  It was really hard not to lounge around and relax every day =).[QWERTY123]Olan is a thoughtful, caring and kind host, always attentive to our needs and spoiling my sister and I with great breakfasts. Truly a warm and sweet person. The apartment is located in a fantastic area, super close to the subway, Chelsea Market, nice restaurants and shops. The room was as described, cozy, with a comfortable bed, lots of fresh towels and goodies for us. We already miss Olan, Big Al and Tuxie, and recommend their place to anybody traveling to NYC.[QWERTY123]Better than amazing! 
Everything said on his list is 100% genuine and accurate and the best part is that Olan is actually extremely nice and went way and beyond to ensure my stay was smooth and pleasant.  
It is the absolute Airbnb experience! 
Will definitely book again next time in NYC.[QWERTY123]Olan was great! The place is very cozy, and there's a cute dog and a sweet cat as well.[QWERTY123]Olan is a kind soul, and an exceptionally thoughtful and caring host. I stayed a month, while taking a weekly teaching certification course, and it was perfectly comfortable. And the occasional breakfast or meal that Olan would make for me was delicious and extra thoughtful. You couldn't ask for more in a host! I'm proud to now count him as a friend. 
The room and bed were both spacious and comfortable, quiet and private, and the room's amenities (mini fridge/freezer, juicer, coffee maker, day bed, etc.) many various snacks, and fresh fruit Olan provided were helpful and a nice treat. I could also use the kitchen's microwave, dishware and utensils whenever I needed. And it helped that the large screen tv had premium channels on demand, so I could catch the last few episodes of GoT!  ""Big"" Al the dog and Tuxie the cat were perfectly sweet and lovable, and I miss them! The neighborhood, Chelsea, is a great balance between lively and neighborly. I enjoyed spending much of my time around Chelsea, and you can get anywhere pretty quickly, either by cab, or the subway, which is a minute's walk away. There's a great laundromat just a block away, and a 24 hour CVS around the corner for anything you might need. I had a great time, and a comfortable stay! Highly recommended![QWERTY123]Olan went out of his way to make me feel welcome and comfortable and even went to the trouble of buying keto-friendly snacks for me. The apartment and the location both felt quiet and safe. The location is awesome. My only regret staying here is that I was so busy that I didnt get to hang out much or say goodbye on my way out![QWERTY123]I had a great experience at Olan's place! He was very responsive to my inquiry and also providing direction and instructions before my stay. The room was exactly what I was looking for during my stay in NYC and Olan had snacks and drinks waiting for me when I arrived. The location was very convenient to everything as well.

I would definitely recommend Olan's place to my friends and others on Airbnb as well as stay there again![QWERTY123]Olan made me feel like a friend in no time at all.  Just as he says on the website, he and the dog and cat welcomed me into their home.  The next time I'm in NYC, I hope space is available at Olan's place so that I can stay with him again.  I think that says it all.[QWERTY123]Olan is extremely welcoming, my stay in his home was a very positive experience[QWERTY123]I left this morning and already I miss the Olan's apartment. Everything was perfect, the room is cozy, furnished in a creative way, bed is comfy. Everything is cleaned. But the most precious value is Olan!! Friendly, gentle, personable, always ready to have chat. A person who has a great culture of life and How to live it. I have a new friend in New York City! Highly Recommended![QWERTY123]Olan was terrific.
I highly recommend this place![QWERTY123]I had a great stay at Olan's place, he went above and beyond what I expected from my first airbnb experience. He was extremely attentive with great breakfasts and masses of gluten free snacks in the room - even a fridge which I didn't expect - and tips about things to do in Manhattan. The room is very comfortable for one person, and Al (the dog) and Tuxie (the cat) are the cutest.[QWERTY123]Olan is a lovely host, he is friendly, caring and considerate. The room is as described and in a perfect location. The bathroom and shower was clean and well stocked. It is situated by the front door for private coming and going, though Al (Olan's pet dog) also likes to announce your entrance![QWERTY123]I’ve visited New York seven times and Olan’s AirBNB is definitely my preferred choice for future visits – firstly, if you are flying in via JFK go can use the A train from the airport to 14th St, and the apartment is 200 feet from the Subway entrance – it costs $7 plus change, its fast and reliable, and airport transfers can be painful in NYC so being able to use the train was a huge plus.

Location wise, I always stay in Chelsea. It’s a safe, interesting area which is well catered by the Subway – Chelsea Markets is at the end of the block, along with a good selection of local eateries, easy access to the High Line and Greenwich, Christopher St and the Meatpacking District are all a stones throw away, so the immediate neighbourhoods are great as well, you can easily spend the day just exploring the local neighbourhood.

I rented the smaller of the two rooms which has a comfortable loft bed with freshly laundered bed linen, a huge piles of fresh towels and a bathrobe – and it was so quiet compared to other places I’ve stayed! There was a coffee machine, a small fridge stocked with snacks and water, and a bowl of fruit, all of which was courtesy of Olan and much appreciated – Olan was a very generous host who offered to cook breakfast (which I would have taken up if I wasn’t up and out the door every morning), my stay was closer to a Bed and Breakfast experience more than a ‘spare room for rent’ situation – Olan is a very friendly and generous host, keen to interact with his guests – if this is your first time visiting NYC and you feel a little anxious about what its going to be like, then this would be a great place to stay – Olan is a New Yorker and genuinely interested in you enjoying your stay, as well as a wealth of local knowledge it’s great to have someone to talk to when you get back from a days exploring.

Along with the towels, fruit, toiletries, etc you also get a dog and a cat – Al and Tuxie are part of the package and enjoy an occasional pat - Al will announce your arrival with a little barking, so sneaking in quietly in the early hours isn’t an option, but he settles down as soon as he realises who you are.

So based on several stays in New York, Olan’s apartment goes to the top of the list for being a convenient location, a very comfortable place to sleep or relax, and a very generous host who offers guests a very warm and friendly experience – recommended.[QWERTY123]조용한 동네에 위치하고 있고, 지하철역에 가까워 여행하기에 적합합니다!! 게다가 현관 바로 옆이고, 화장실도 가까워 사생활도 보장되어 정말 편하게 쉴 수 있었습니다. 먹을 것과 수건 등을 충분히 제공해주었고 평소에도 호스트에게서 많은 도움을 받았어요. (바닥이나 화장실이 완죠니 깔끄미한 거슨 아니어쯰만 괜찮아요!!!) 올란에게 정말 고맙고 그 덕분에 좋은 여행이 되었어요 :) 다시 뉴욕을 방문한다면 또 묵고 싶어요!!! 강!력!추!천!!!! 
It was a perfect room for solo traveler who wants to stay at a place like his or her own home in NY. Check-in and out was super easy. Olan, his lovely dog Al, and sweet cat Tuxie, everyone welcomed me and helped me feel more comfortable. 
The subway stations are really close and I could find the cleaner's and market(duane read or other deli) near this flat. Chelsea area is full of things you can enjoy during your stay. I want to stay at this room again in my next travel! I strongly recommend you to stay at Olan's  flat! :D[QWERTY123]I had a really great time and this is by far my best experience. 
Olan is a wonderful person and host. He is nice and have really interesting discussions. He took care of every detail of my stay and was always here to help. 

The apartment has a pleasant artistic touch and is clean. The location is perfect for exploring New York,it is located in the center of Manhattan and close from a subway station. The area of Chelsea itself have a lot of interesting places.  

This was also a great social experience, I had the chance to meet a lot of Olan friends who are very nice and welcoming. Al and Tuxie are adorable and will always strive to be petted. In addition the breakfasts are incredible.

I hope Olan enjoyed my stay as much as I did and I would be delighted to renew that experience.[QWERTY123]I stayed with Olan for 3 months during a summer internship at (Hidden by Airbnb) . The experience was absolutely wonderful. For the entirety of my stay, Olan always made sure I was comfortable and had everything I needed. It truly felt like a home away from home. If I am in the area again, I will certainly stay with Olan.[QWERTY123]Best host ever. Made me breakfast a few times, did the sheets and laundry, has super friendly pets. The location is perfect![QWERTY123]Fantastic host and great stay. Room was  very thoughtfully arranged."	40.74008464146504	-74.00270637981387	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/21794	2	111.0	0.9
74	9783	"One of the most pleasant stays in New York City I've had! My girlfriend and I were looking for something cheap, comfortable, and convenient, and Ssameer's place fit the bill on all three. Safe neighborhood, super close to the subway, and wonderful assortment of eateries. 

Ssameer is a great host. He gave us a warm welcome, didn't place any unreasonable restrictions, and was an overall sweet and chill guy. 

As for the room itself, it was small but perfect for our needs. The bunk-bed w/ futon squeaked and wavered a bit when we climbed up but we got used to it after the first couple of times (not dangerous at all, just a bit unnerving at first). The only (just slightly) uncomfortable part of the room was the heat, but that is to be expected in a small room w/ a radiator in the winter (just shut the radiator down and open the nearby window-guard). We were easily able to fit our 2 pieces of luggage and other belongings in the closet as well.

If you're looking for a home-base while you travel around Manhattan, this is as good as it gets.[QWERTY123]Ssameer's place was perfect for a quick weekend in the city. We're still on the bus back to DC but couldn't wait to post another rave review about Ssameer. It was easy to set things up, he helped us find our way to his place (how we got lost when he lives a block from the subway is beoynd me!), and was super friendly - right away he invited us to a cool invite only art party. Little room and bunk beds were all we needed to crash in the wee hours of the morning. Apartment is hot as advertised, but otherwise the experience was almost perfect![QWERTY123]he's just great!! very polite, very gentle, very friendly.. the place is great too, well located, pretty clean..i just loved, and i'll be back soon! i solemnly recommend![QWERTY123]the best place and apt-mate ever!! I solemnly recommend![QWERTY123]Our stay was very enjoyable, Sameer was very nice and our listening.
The apartment was good too. We hope to return.[QWERTY123]Sameer's a great host who went to a lot of trouble to make sure I was comfortably situated.  His apartment is virtually next to the subway.  Highly recommended![QWERTY123]Ssameer's a cool guy. laid back and such. the apt is decent for the price. Ask him about the squab.[QWERTY123]Ssameer is a perfect host, incredibly helpful, very nice person,shares everything and thinks about what u might need before u ask for it. the place 2 minutes from subway.liked the atmosphere.highly recommended! thank you, Ssameer![QWERTY123]Ssameer was so helpful, friendly, kind, etc: a great host! The place was also wonderful; apartment was super-near the subway and the room was both neat and clean. Thank you so much![QWERTY123]The apartment is great for the price. It is very near the subway... you can be in Times Square in 15 minutes. We only saw Ssameer once for about 2 mintues when we checked-in, but he was very nice and helpful. He sent us to a great Japanese place on St. Marks which we ended up visiting twice. I would definitely recommend Ssameer's place to fellow airbnb travelers.[QWERTY123]had a great time @ sameers place!
thx for all...keep rocking tek life!
ire&fisso[QWERTY123]I second what Keller says.

Sameer totally rocks! He's super helpful and laid back. The location and price are great. A block from the subway. He pointed out changing at 96th from the local 1 to the express 2 or 3 lines which saved me a bunch of time plus he extended some other help that I hugely appreciate.[QWERTY123]I had a wonderful time at Ssameers place. He is a very nice person, you can speak with him for hours on any argument. He also gave me a lot of indications and he was really helpful when I had to look for restaurants or cafès. His place is really close to the subway and the neighborhood was totally safe. The room was clean and I had all the privacy I needed. I definitely recommend it![QWERTY123]If you like a NY 'artsy' apt, on a first floor, in a busy friendly safe neighborhood, close to subway, buses, and all NYC has to offer....and love conversations with a fascinating, charming, caring host who can share ideas on many topics -  sign up to stay at Ssameer's place. You will love it!! Thanks for all Ssameer!![QWERTY123]We had a great time at Ssameers place. The room in clean and private, and the building is very close to the metro, a 1 or 2 minute walk. Totally worth it.[QWERTY123]ssammeer is the koolest kat! he was very respectful and accomodating. so accomodating that he stayed up til 3am for my oober late arrival. THAT's really something... the room was just the right size for a short-stay. i'd totally book a room from him again on my next nyc escapade. snappps![QWERTY123]great stay.  I learned that i need an alternatie bathromo and must get over my fear of bunk beds. Place was clean, comfortable and host was kind and generous  avail. and nightly rate ws most helpful 9Instead o 3 night min.)[QWERTY123]Awesome host!  Although the place is pretty small, its location and price more than made up for it.  =)[QWERTY123]Affordable and convenient location. Very close to multiple subway lines. Fairly safe neighbourhood with a lot of foot traffic. Rooms are small, but if you are visiting NYC, I don't imagine one would spend much time in their room.[QWERTY123]I had a good time staying at Ssameer's. It's small, but clean and felt like someone's home. Would definitely stay here again.[QWERTY123]My daughter and I spent two wonderful weeks at Ssameer´s place and we felt at home there immediately. The room was small compared to European standard but that was just fine, especially compared to the phantastic price - apart form that  we were out in the city all day long anyway. Sameer is a wonderful host and so helpful in respect of interesting information which you would not easily find in the tourist guide. 

It was such a different experience from staying in a hotel as we got the chance to see NYC through the eyes of a person who lives in NYC. 

Thank´s a lot, Ssameer.

Isabella + Laura (from Austria)[QWERTY123]We couldn't see each other much but he was friendly and kindly. The room was close to subway, and it was really nice.. What I can say more is I would like stay there again if it is still affordable... Thanks sameer. Good luck..[QWERTY123]great place to stay, thanks Ssameer.[QWERTY123]I just came from staying here for a day. Ssmeer was very nice and accommodating. I will absolutely use this service again![QWERTY123]My sister and I stayed at Ssameer's appartement for one week. 
Ssameer was very helpful and friendly and the place was close to the subway which came in handy. 
The room is small and really warm but for the price, the whole experience was worth it. We got to get a feel of the real Manhattan opposed to staying in a touristy area.[QWERTY123]Nice hospitality, very friendly, gives great advice to newcomers to NYC. Quiet neighborhood, parking is a bit tricky but always had a place to park in front of the apartment.  Very close to alot of places to visit, Central Park, Museums, downtown is only a few minutes away by subway or car.  Would stay again!! Thanks Ssameer...[QWERTY123]it was great i really enjoyed it
everything was clean and organized
I can just suggest to everybody Ssameer's flat[QWERTY123]NA[QWERTY123]Ssammeer is one of the coolest guy I ever met, he was very helpful with us and suggested a lot of things to do. His flat was very comfy and clean, we had everything we needed and it was awesome to go 'home' day by day to such a great flat and have a rest before the next day in the city. Definitely suggested'[QWERTY123]Ssameer is definitely one of the nicest hosts I've ever met. He helped me and my friend out the first night we flew in and gave us a few good eateries, esp around the area. Definitely recommend this place, despite its location. But even then, Ssameer reassures you that it's not a scary place to wander, even at night.
[QWERTY123]Ssameer's deal is unbeatable guys. Almost in the heart of Manhattan, 20 steps away from the subway, a great neighborhood and your own bedroom. He is kind and considerate towards his guests (he even has towels for you if you need) and readily available to help you find your way around the city. And if you need a tip on a good food joint or, as in my case, on a nice nearby place for a phenomenal jog, he's always chill and willing to help. Loved my stay in New York, memories of a life time and not in small part thanks to him and his guestroom.[QWERTY123]stayed for a week at Ssameer's
didn't see him much
but the few contacts with him were ok
a good host 
for the future dutch guests: neem een pakje stroopwafels mee ;)[QWERTY123]Both rooms tiny but cozy – in one full of cool stuff (turntables, boards etc.) apartment in a nice hood, right next to metro (1) station. Bargain price and chilled out host. Go get it! NYC and Ssameer rule![QWERTY123]Great location near the subway. We stayed 5 nights and saved a ton of money! I wish there was another bathroom for all of the people staying there, but otherwise it was great.[QWERTY123]This guy is awesome :) everything everybody else said about him is under rated.[QWERTY123]Great guy, great place, great location and great price.

Thanks for an awesome stay![QWERTY123]A great place to stay in NYC. Nice and interesting neighbourhood with great, cheap delis and supermarkets all over! Practically on the subway tracks (line 1) which will take you straight to the Theatre District and Fashion/Garment District and beyond! The room we stayed in (the one with the futon and loft bed) was small, but adequate - we weren't in NYC to sit in our room! 
Ssameer was helpful with touristic (and not so touristic!) info about the city, and he even had money-off coupons - where to go, where to eat, what to see and do. There was also a sizable stack of up-to-date City guide books in the room. We had a great time and would be happy to come back! Thanks Ssameer![QWERTY123]its always a pleasure to stay with my boy, Ssameer. He's the best host in the world. he always makes me feel like l'm at home and like a little sister. I highly recommend staying with Ssameer. we have the coolest yet most intelligent conversations. I'm forever grateful that I meet an awesome person such as Ssameer. Thanks a lot bro.[QWERTY123]Stayed there twice within two weeks! See review below![QWERTY123]In a few short words: great place for a great price! Ssameer's an awesome dude too! Located at the most convenient intersection for good food, two deli's, and the metro is very very close! I highly suggest this place! So warm and cozy, very tropical.[QWERTY123]Truly enjoyed our stay!  Ssameer is a lot of fun to hang out with and gave great recommendations on where to eat and tips on how to optimize our subway rides. The room was small, but just right for holding our stuff and sleeping after a long day of adventures - exactly what we needed. When we are back in NY we plan to stay here again.[QWERTY123]very helpful and flexible[QWERTY123]Apartment is convenient to subway (1 line) and Ssameer is a responsible, helpful and upbeat host.  I recommend![QWERTY123]Great place! I stayed here in January for a week with one of my friends. Ssameer was an amazing host. If you want to stay somewhere without the awkward feeling that you are staying in some strengers home, this is the place to go. From the moment we walked in Ssameer was friendly, accomodating, and extremely helpful. This appartment is directly accross from the subway, so getting around was super easy. I would definitely recomend staying here, I know if I'm ever in New York again Ssameer will be my frist choice for somewhere to stay![QWERTY123]Ssameer was an awesome host.  He was ready to show us around and help us out with the local trains and attractions.  He was also very inviting.  We found ourselves engaging him in a variety of conversation even though we only had a one night stay.  The room was great, cozy and warm and exactly as he describes in the listing.  I would recommend Ssameers place to anyone needing a quick stay.[QWERTY123]Ssameer was a great host.  Very friendly and laid back.  The room was clean and comfortable.  I would happily stay there again.[QWERTY123]Ssameer is a fantastic host.  Very friendly where one feels instantly at ease.  His apartment is a block away from the subway and is very comfortable.  Next visit to New York, I'm re-booking with Ssameer.[QWERTY123]All other reviews are spot-on: it's clean, close to the 1-train, he was helpful recommending restaurants.  Great place to stay.[QWERTY123]SSameer was a great host, we didn't see each other much, but he was very helpful when I needed directions and on some cheap eats, overall he made my stay so much easier. 
[QWERTY123]Sameer is awesome, very friendly and helpful, great experience.  Best way to visit NYC.  Cool people, would definitely return.[QWERTY123]My friend and I had a wonderful time in New York at Ssameer's private and conveniently cheap room. His place is located within 50 yards of the subway and it is extremely close to the M60 bus stop-- the bus which takes you directly to and/or from Laguardia Airport. Ssameer has exceptional knowledge of the city, so don't hesitate to ask him any questions. Thanks again Ssameer.[QWERTY123]Our first time stayed with host. He's very nice, gave us a warm welcome and good suggestion. Cheap place and just five min. walk to subway.[QWERTY123]What to say, Ssameer is great host and we really enjoyed. His place is full of positive energy, clean and close to the subway. If we come back to NY we will stay at Ssameers place again.[QWERTY123]Ssameer is just the nicest host. Very uncomplicated and open minded.  Very kind and smart.
I enjoyed staying with him a lot, as well as our conversations. 
I stayed with him for a week during an opera-competition I took part in. Ssameer was very understanding and supportive.

WHAT I AM ACTUALLY TRYING TO SAY IS:
If you go to New York and in this huge, overwelming city you would like to go to a place you can feel somewhat at home, try staying with Ssameer. Worked for me...[QWERTY123]Ssameer was a great host. His place is safe and secure and a great place to get a good nights rest, especially when you are out all day in the city.  The Metro station is even closer than what I thought it would be and it takes you down from his place to the bay and hits every major hot spot in NYC.  I’d recommend his place if you are needing a place to stay and really experience NYC![QWERTY123]Nice host, room is very small and bed quite uncomfortable but for a short cheap stay its the perfect place. Subway nearby and Neighboorhood seemed quite save (I was a woman travelling alone)[QWERTY123]Room was very easy to get to via subway- Sameer made some great recommendations on what to check out in the immediate are. Recommended.[QWERTY123]This was a great value and easy to get to from the subway.  If you are on a budget and want to stay in Manhanttan, great option![QWERTY123]great location.just beside the subway.simple, cozy and economical. ideal for young travellers with a budget.[QWERTY123]Great host! Super nice and relax guy! Location is nice too, and very well priced.[QWERTY123]Ssameer is a very friendly host! And the subway is only like 2min away! My brother enjoyed his stay![QWERTY123]Ssameer is a terrific host- gave us a key to get in and out when we needed. No problem using kitchen. 1 subway stop away from where we needed to be. Simply can't beat the price.[QWERTY123]Ssameer is a good host. He greeted us when we arrived and was accommodating. My main complaint with the room was just that it was really hot, but otherwise fine. We didn't spend much time there because we were out in the city all day and night, but it was sufficient for our needs. Nothing fancy, but just right if you need somewhere to rest your head and take a shower.[QWERTY123]Ssameer Ssierra is a nice host. The location is good, only one block away from subway. If you don't mind to share the bathroom with the other guests, this is a good place to stay.[QWERTY123]we Liked iit a lot  we felt like at home and the host was friendly.We lll go again thanks Gabriella and Ester[QWERTY123]Great Host!!!! Supplied very useful info regarding navigation and gave excellent recs on local entertainment. I did not feel like a tourist at all! Our NYC trip was a fabulous experience and when we go back, I hope to stay at Ssameer's place![QWERTY123]Ssameer was away while I was in NYC but his friend looked after me and was very helpful and nice. I had a great time. Really good location. Totally recommend![QWERTY123]The title says it all. It's cheap and, man, is it ever convenient.  1/2 block from the #1 train is about as close as you can get.[QWERTY123]Ssameer is a great communicator! His airbnb listing is great, the location is steps away from the subway, a grocery store and cafes! Very nice neighbourhood, the people are very friendly. The bed was comfy, and the apartment was very cozy, Would definitly reccomend this place to anyone on a budget![QWERTY123]Ssameer was away during my stayed, but his friend Dasha looked after his place. Dasha was helpful and friendly. The place is just like it names 'convenient cheap room', great location, close to subway line 1, it takes 15mins journeys to Manhattan. Room is small, but comfortable and clean. Highly recommended!![QWERTY123]Ssamer is a great host, and the room is comfortable. I would be there for more time. I really recommend this.[QWERTY123]Nice and comfy room for a reasonable price. I only stayed one night but Sameer is an excellent host. It was like visiting an old friend you haven't met in ages. I highly recommend staying at his place if you're in town for a few days.[QWERTY123]Very good experience, and I was very happy with it all.  It is as it says, ""convenient, cheap room."" The building is steps away from a nice, modern supermarket, McDonalds, liquor store, and other little shops, plus it's barely a 2 minute walk to the subway (#1 train - 15 minutes to Times Square).   The host, Ssameer, is very gracious and helpful, and simply put, a realy nice guy, and he keeps the apartment spotless.  He gives you pretty much run of the house as far as use of kitchen, bathroom, TV, computer, and just asks that you clean up after yourself.  I'll stay here again.[QWERTY123]Ssameer was a very nice guy. Gave us very good tips for our stay in nyc. Room was a little bit small with our luggage, but very clean and close to the subway. We would enjoy our stay again in Ssameer's flat![QWERTY123]We stayed for four days in this tiny but comfortable room! Ssameer was only there to greet us but provided a wealth of information on how to use the subway and cheap eats nearby. This was a perfect location for a quiet nights' sleep (even with the window open) and to catch the #1 subway line that got us to ALL of the places we wanted to see! I HIGHLY recommend staying here to those of you on a serious budget and the food nearby is delicious! Try La Flor De Broadway, it's steps away! I'm telling all my friends about this place!
Sincerely,

Robyn Z[QWERTY123]From my initial correspondence with SSameer, I thought he was very helpful and patient with the many emails i sent him. Since he wasnt there while we stayed at his place, we ran into a few speed breakers, but overall it was a good stay.[QWERTY123]My stay was without any problem, really cheap and convenient as the title says. And Ssameer is a cool guy too.[QWERTY123]Ssameers gotta be one of the coolest guys I've ever met. Incredibly laidback and easy going. Ssameer is also very helpful with any queries you might have +The apt is extremely close to the subway so its super convenient to get to anywhere you wanna go. All the reviews are spot on. If you wanna stay in Manhattan and you're on a budget, THIS is the place to stay![QWERTY123]Our name is Ivana and Mario and we are the student who came from Europe with J-1 visa to work an travel. After hard working summer we decided to travel around the east coast and it was great! I hope so that I will come back and explore west coast.[QWERTY123]Such a nice trip ! He's very nice and helpful, the room is clean and quiet, everything was great ![QWERTY123]SSameer's appartment was easy to find being just off the 137th street College station.  I would recommend getting a 1 week or more unlimited metro card to get about as the cost of travel could mount up getting in and out of Manhattan central.
Ssameer wasn't there so his friend Miranda looked after me.  She showed me the room and the appartment and then left me alone which is what I wanted.  Had my own set of keys so I could come and go as I pleased.
The room was small but that suited me as I ws there for the Marathon and didnt need much room.  The room was set out with bunk beds so good for a couple of friends travelling but not for couples.
I would happily use this again next time in New York  as it is cheap, the neighbourhood is safe, the subway fast and safe and all in all a good experience
At no point did I feel uncomfortable or unsecure
[QWERTY123]The room just as described with clean sheets, blankets and towels. The subway number 1 train station is literally a 5 min walk away, super convenient,  we also had full use of the kitchen. I would stay there again in a heartbeat :)[QWERTY123]very clean space.  Small but perfect for two tourists.  Felt safe.  Very easy to get around, close to subway station that gets you anywhere.  Ssameer is a very cool guy, very helpful and kind.  Highly recommended[QWERTY123]Ssameer is a very cool guy, very helpful and kind.The place is small but perfect for two tourists. Felt safe. Very easy to get around, it´s far away from times square but so close to subway station that  you can go anywhere. Highly recommended[QWERTY123]Ssameer's place was great.  I couldn't have asked for more during my stay.  He provided exactly what he describes in his room description: an affordable, conveniently located, and clean room.  He was a friendly host as well, sharing restaurant recommendations and other insights about NYC living.  I would definitely stay at his place on any other future trips to New York.  Thanks again Ssameer.[QWERTY123]Ssameer is a nice guy very friendly and helpful. The flat have a good location, very close to the subway.[QWERTY123]Ssameer was a very good host. We were very comfortable and had no problem at all with him. We would surely recommend to stay at his place![QWERTY123]Great location, cozy space, gracious hosts.  My stay was very last-minute and brief at that, but Ssameer and Miranda felt genuinely warm.  If you get the chance, ask about Ssameer's collection of homemade drinks :) Enjoy a visit here.[QWERTY123]It's a decent place perfect for those who need to crash for 1 or 2 nights. If you're not too worried about space or privacy, this is a good place to stay. It literally only takes 2-3 minutes to walk to the 1 train station. For the price, it's totally worth it.[QWERTY123]Ssameer is an excellent host, very welcoming to respectful guests in his home and happy to help you enjoy your stay in NYC.  There were guidebooks and maps available, along with his personal tips for places to go and how to get around.  He even had a spare laptop for us to use for internet access in the apartment.  It is a small place, but with a creative atmosphere in a lively neighborhood.  Located on the 1st floor at the rear of the building, with easy access and little street noise.  Highly recommended.[QWERTY123]Not only was the room exactly as described but Ssameer is equally as described by many previous guests.  As a host, he was very welcoming, respectful, helpful, and did everything he could to make my stay as enjoyable and convenient as possible.  If you're looking for an alternative to the hotel and hostel route this is a great introduction to both the airbnb experience and a new way to enjoy one of the greatest cities in the world. 
The location, price, and cleanliness of Ssameer's place honestly cannot be beat.  Great experience, nuff said.
5 outta 5 and all that.[QWERTY123]The room was exactly as I expected it. A bit small, but I didn't intend to spend a lot of time in there. And when I had work to do (being freelance has its downsides) I was either in a wifi-enabled coffeeshop, or Ssameer was happy for me to use the living room. The apartment is close to a subway top, and in a generally nice part of town, north of Central Park. Getting around using the subway was fairly painless. Even at 4 in the morning.

Ssameer and Miranda were excellent hosts. I got loads of information about the city, homebrewing, Linux, and just about everything else you can imagine. Ssameer is a fun, lively guy who's happy to feed you his homebrews and chat until the crazy hours of the morning if you let him.

It was my first Airbnb experience, and Ssameer made it a great one. I would definitely go back.[QWERTY123]Ssammer is a great guy. We had a great time in NY, he gave as advise about NY. Thanks a lot !!!![QWERTY123]Great week in NY. The flat is really well located to enjoy the city and the room is just what is needed, with storage place to install comfortably.
Travelers : it's really a very convenient cheap room ![QWERTY123]Ssameer is  great host! Very convenient check-in and check-out. Apt was clean and close to subway. Overall, great experience.[QWERTY123]I stayed just 3 nights with my mother, and it was just perfect!! Sameer is a really cool guy and a good Host. He gave us a lot of advises about the city, and some places to eat...ect! I just want to say  THANKS FOR EVERYTHING DUDE!! If i go to NEw York Again, it s sure,,,,I will stay in Sameer s appartment!![QWERTY123]He is not only a great host, but also a great person! 

You wanna stay in New York City, being close to sights, having great opportunities to dine for good value right next door, staying at a very clean and very comfortable place with a great host... what are you waiting for? Book it, now! Here we go! ;)

Thank you, I am pretty sure that I ll come at least for a visit soon again!

Best always![QWERTY123]Ssameer was a great host and his girlfriend is really nice. They both answer all my tourist type questions; where to eat, how to get to different places, etc. Bed was very comfortable, everything was very clean. The room was small but it didnt matter to me because I was out all day. Very close to subway. Totally would consider staying with Ssameer again : )[QWERTY123]This is a very basic room in a great upper east side location. You get what you pay for so if you're expecting luxury digs, you're in the wrong place.

-room is small, 2 people staying there better be close
-bed was comfortable
-Ssameer was a good host, brimming with information about and love for his neighborhood
-bring earplugs
-the tap water is tasty
-no lock on the bedroom door
-Ssameer was kind enough to offer me a towel, which I totally didn't expect
-some older buildings, no matter what the tenant is like, are trashy and dirty. This is kind of one of those buildings.

Overall, I'd say that this was probably one of the best values for the price that a person could expect. I'd stay with Ssameer again in the future if he'd have me and be sure to stop by Nadal for an egg and cheese hero.[QWERTY123]great value for money.[QWERTY123]I recommend Ssamer! He's very nice and very helpful :)
He's leaves a computer at your disposal and, for us, a small cozy room!
Enjoy your stay![QWERTY123]Ssameer was very nice and the appartment is well located, easy to find and close to public transportation. The bedroom was comfortable and clean. I recommend this place![QWERTY123]I highly recommend staying with Ssameer.  The room was clean, as advertised, and the building was easy to find.  The neighborhood is safe, no matter what time of day or night.  Ssameer himself was ready to offer a wealth of helpful information, and was very polite.  I'd definitely stay at his apartment again![QWERTY123]The room is definitely cozy and exactly what we needed for an affordable, very comfortable, impromptu one night stay in NYC.  Location is really close to the 1 & neighborhood felt safe.  The room and bathroom was very clean and Miranda was friendly, hospitable & accommodating with check-in/out.  Thank you!![QWERTY123]The space is basic but clean, and the location is only one block from the subway stop on the 1. For me it was what I wanted and needed. Ssameer was great with information as needed.[QWERTY123]Ssmaeer is a great host very warm and friendly. Location was great not to far out. It's a great place to stay if you want to get out of the real touristy area's in NYC. Shops and subway a right at the door step and Ssameer gives great advice on where to get yummy food in NYC. Room was a good size and the neighborhood was quiet at night. Highly recommend for a stay in NYC. Thanks again Ssameer.[QWERTY123]The accommodation was exactly as described- small and cozy, clean and comfortable.  The second night there was significant noise from the alley, but besides that no complaints.  Sameer was a friendly host willing to share lots of info about the city, where to eat, transportation, etc.  Overall Sameer's room is a fantastic deal and I would definitely stay here again.[QWERTY123]Ssameer was not there during my stay, so I am unable to review him - only my stay.  The person he left in charge, Sally, was a perfect host - friendly, helpful, interesting and great to talk to.  We spent the whole first day and night of my stay talking as I was too tired to go out after a sleepless night on an overnight flight.  The place was exactly as described - small, but neat and clean and hadI everything that one needs for a comfortable stay.  It is in a great position - right on Manhattan Island and is easy to get to from JFK or anywhere else I would imagine.  The 137th street subway is only 5 minutes away, which takes you all over the island.  The price is fantastic for New York and I would not hesitate recommending Ssameer's place to anyone, especially if they are on a budget.  I look forward to staying there again for 2 nights this coming weekend.[QWERTY123]Ssameer was not there during my stay, the room was exactly what i needed, alongside subway and fastfood places.
Sally was great to know it and loved greatly appreciated the tips she gave me and I had the opportunity to practice my English.
If I ever return to NYC again I definitely would look to stay there.
Thanks for everything.
[QWERTY123]I had a great time staying at Ssameer's apartment. Sally was a friendly and knowledgeable host.  The area is close to a lot of things: The Hudson River, the train station, great restaurants and nightlife. Thanks Sally and Ssameer for making my stay enjoyable![QWERTY123]I stayed at Ssameer's flat for a week and was really happy with my room. It is quite small but you have everything you need especially when you are there as a tourist and spend most of your time around the city. The flat is very clean and cosy and the subway is just a few minutes away. Thanks for a great time Sally and Ssameer![QWERTY123]The price/value ratio is certainly impressive - the price is really cheap considering the location.

If the accomodation was more expensive, the review would be negative, but I can't really not appreciate the location+price factor.

As for the pros:
- VERY close to central park and downtown - just a few minutes by subway, the apartment is located 200 meters from the subway station
- located in a safe, dominican neighbourhood - big store very close to the apartment
- the price is excellent, period.
- I didn't have a chance to meet Ssameer but Sally, who was taking care of the apartment was pleasant and helpful - everything related to check-in, check-out or any issues we had was handled very smoothly
- the place has a positive vibe - lots of vinyl records, books etc - kinda funky, I liked it

However, if you're looking for hotel-like quality, it's probably not a spot for you:
- there's not much light in there, all windows are covered and the buildings around are high, so you can't tell the weather from inside ;)
- the bathroom is... well, basic. but you wouldn't expect a jacuzzi at a 30$ apartment, would you?
- beds are OK, but much less comfortable than in hotel settings
- there are mice on the floor above - that means a lot of strange noises in the ceiling - none in the apartment, though


In general: if you're looking for a sterile place with fancy amenities, it's not a place for you. However, if you're looking for a short-term, deadly cheap acommodation in a great location with internet access, a kitchen and a private room - Ssameer's apartment seems like an option that is worth considering.[QWERTY123]We had a great stay and sally was a great host! Ssameer had great communication with me the whole time! Lovely experience![QWERTY123]Good place to stay. A block away from the 1 line which will take you to the 2/3 for express. Privacy is given but if you want company, Sally was friendly.[QWERTY123]This flat has everything you need as a traveler, clean room, bathroom and kitchen) its very close to subway. 
I enjoyed staying there with Sally. Loved our evening talks:)
[QWERTY123]Host was always as helpful as possible. The location was good (close to subway and a great Dominican cafe. (We were also lucky to be located outside of the main hurricane zone!) The room looked as advertised with bunk beds. The other guests were awesome - a Harvard graduate and an expert on anthropology, made for some great conversations! Overall I was very pleased with my choice.[QWERTY123]Я второй раз останавливался в этой квартире. Всё меня устраивает. К сожалению в этот раз не встретился с  Самиром и Мирандой.  Зато познакомился с удивительно красивой и умной Салли. Спасибо ей за помощь и доброе отношение. Прекрасное жилье!!!!
The second time I stayed in this apartment. Everything is fine for me. Unfortunately this time I have not met with Ssameer and Miranda. But I met with a surprisingly beautiful and intelligent Sally. Thank her for the help and kindness. Excellent accommodation!![QWERTY123]This was an excellent AirBnB, highly recommend. It is located in a very convenient location and Ssameer was always very quick to communicate. The real treat of this airBnB is Ssameer's host, Sally. Really enjoyed our conversations about the many places she has visited and books she's read. Sally's friendliness and hospitality is really what the AirBnB experience is all about.[QWERTY123]my friend and I really enjoyed our staying in NY at ssameer sierra's place. our room was good enough to relax after a very intense everyday-tour of NY. If you need just a place for the night to rest and sleep, I really suggest this kind of place.[QWERTY123]Good place, a little small but overall comfortable. Clean and quiet room. Very close to the train station (Red, Line 1). Ssameer wasn't at home during my stay but Sally was great! She has excellent recommendations to get to know NY very well.[QWERTY123]This is my second time staying here (which speaks for itself) and it is all the good things the reviews already say-- it's clean, convenient, and Sally was fun to talk to.  I recommend![QWERTY123]So amazing an experience! Definitely a top choice. Sally is so helpful in guiding you NYC, also a great friend to learn with![QWERTY123]Had a great time at Sameer's place.  Sally was a total star and would definitely stay again. Thanks so much.[QWERTY123]The place is small but adequate, especially with such cheap rate. Sally is very nice and me and my boyfriend had a great time staying there. Only 5 mins walk to the subway and the surrounding area is safe. I would definitely recommend it![QWERTY123]I had a great time ! Great location and great value for New York ! Saly was very kind and she helped me a lot during my stay over there as a very reliable guide ! Thank you again ![QWERTY123]Probably the cheapest room you'll find at such a premium location. The room is really small but clean. Bathroom was also ok. Ssameer hadn't been there in person, since he's travelling right now. He answered all my emails though - big thumps up! At the location Sally had been my actual host: She was very helpful and nice as well! Would definately come back![QWERTY123]Ssameer was away and we missed him but Sally was great. She was very helpful and hospitable. Thank you, Sally![QWERTY123]Can't beat this place. Clean, comfortable, convenient, safe, quiet, blasting hot water in the shower, all the good stuff. Ssameer was always on top of communication with me when I had questions, both before and during my stay of four nights. Sally, who keeps things running at the apartment, is always there to help you. Take advantage of her wealth of knowledge about New York, especially all the amazing things you can do for free. She loves to help with that. Would definitely stay here again. Thanks![QWERTY123]Sally was a great host. She was very knowledgable about the NYC area and I enjoyed her very much! She helped me navigate the city like a pro!

The apartment was everything the listing states. However, I am not 100% sure that I got clean linening and that's a little problem for me. The apartment is a little old and could use a deep cleaning. My room was very suitable because I just needed a place to rest my head after having a busy day in NY. 

I didnt meet Sameer but Sally was more than I needed as a host. I really enjoyed the Harlem neighborhood and the access to the Subway. I purchased a $30 subway card and it was great!

[QWERTY123]We spent a wonderful journey at Ssameer's home. He wasn't at home. But we were welcome by Sally and she was very kind and very helpful . We loved to have great talks with her about New York.[QWERTY123]Acabo de volver de esta maravillosa ciudad. Sammer no estaba pero Sally fue increible con nosotras. La habitacion es pequeña pero no se puede pedir mas por menos en NY. Bien situada, muy cerca del metro y en un barrio muy seguro. Repetiria con Sally[QWERTY123]This was my first airbnb experience and to be honest I'm surprised this site has so many perfect reviews. Overall, me and my friend didn't have a good experience there.

I'll start with the good things, the location is okay, is in a latin neighborhood very close to the subway so it's easy to go to all the touristy places from there. The other good thing was the price, if you don't want to spend more money that place is actually a good option, but you have to consider that the apartment is far from being cozy or clean.

Another good thing was that ssameer tried to do his best to acommodate our dates,and the comunication was fluid. However, both times we arrived there (we had two different bookings), Sally wasn't there to open the door so we had to wait for her.

The two things we disliked the most were the lack of cleanliness and privacy. The woman who lives there is always in the living room next to the rooms, so you can't leave your room without seeing her and you can't have a private conversation with your roommate either, because she's always there and the apartment is small. Also the room doesn't have a lock and since they also rent another room,it made me feel a bit unsafe because of course we had no idea who was renting the other room.

Another thing we disliked was the smell of the entire apartment, it smelled like food all the time and the bathroom was always wet, and to be honest, a big disgusting. I think they definitely should try to clean the place more often.

Also, If you can't sleep with noise then don't come here. The neighbors start playing very loud music in the mornings.

[QWERTY123]The apartment where I stayed in Manhattan was comfortable, safe, affordable, and quiet.  Our host Sally was very helpful and kind.  I would definitely recommend others to stay there because it is close to a supermarket, McDonald's, a park, and the subway train station.
Mary

Thanks Sally.  You are a star.  Thanks Ssameer for kindly answering my email and taking my phone call.  Helpful pizza reccomendations too!  Would stay here again!   
Mark[QWERTY123]The host, Ssameer, is very accommodating and Sally (who lives in the apartment) is very friendly. The room is rather small (and the kitchen is really tiny) but we used it just for sleeping in, so it was perfect! There's not much to do inside the apartment but it is right next to the subway so you can easily get to places.[QWERTY123]La ubicación és perfecta, muy buena comunicación con el centro de la ciudad, metro y buses.
El piso está muy bien aunque bastante sucio y desordenado. El colchón de abajo bastante incómodo, pero estábamos tan cansados al final del día que dormíamos igualmente. 
No llegamos a conocer a Sammeer pero si estubimos con Sally, nos aconsejó muy bien qué cosas hacer, fué muy agradable!

Resumiendo, el precio y la ubicación és lo mejor del sitio. 
[QWERTY123]Hola, voy a empezar con lo muy bueno, la ubicación  tiene el metro linea 1 y  bus M3 y M4 a una calle, hay un supermercado al lado y muchas tiendas de comida. El barrio es latino y para mi ha sido fantastico ya que soy Española. Sally es fantastica, hemos pasado grandes momentos con ella. Ssammer siempre me contesto con rapidez. Lo no tan bueno es que la habitación podría estar mejor como en la fotografia y no lo está y falta que esté más limpio.
[QWERTY123]We stayed for 10 Days at Ssammeers Place. At this time we shared the appartment with Sally and most of the time two other Visitors in the other Room. The Room is really small and if you're a Person who has to live in a very tidy and clean place I would recommend for you to look somewhere else to stay. Also we all shared one bathroom. This worked out fine for us, others might get crazy about that.
My friend and me loved it, though. It's a very lively and multicultural neighbourhood, the University is close, the metro as well. Nice Restaurants and many stores and supermarkets are nearby. Sally as our host was just lovely and a very hospitable person who has a lot of good tips for NYC and the direct neighbourhood. It's the perfect place if you wanna visit NYC on a budget and you're just need a place to sleep and shower.
My friend and me had a great time. Thank you,Sally and Sssammeer![QWERTY123]This is a good place to stay for a few reasons.
First it's located in the North of Manhattan which makes it accessible and relatively easy on the metro. The journey time can take time but it's easy enough.
Second it's a fair price. As long as you are realistic about what to expect for the money it's warm; and it was fine for a father and son team because of the bunks.
Thirdly Sally is a knowledgeable host who gave lots of good advice about where to visit and how to get there. She made it easy for us to get in and out with relevant keys and was there to welcome us when we arrived. She is great to chat to and a real character. You will learn a lot about NY life from her; that's not something you are ever going to get from a chain hotel.
Its fairly basic accommodation too. Bedding is limited to a couple of blankets. The room its really all you get because the lounge area isn't big enough for guests and the kitchen isn't a place to cook; so eat out, but there are local cheap places to do that which is ok.
The bathroom is pretty basic. Ok for a wash and cleaning teeth but don't expect too much.
The electrics in the flat are pretty basic too. Ok for charging phones and laptops but it could do with a once over by an electrician, some charging points were loose!
I really appreciated the fast and efficient communication. Booking and confirmation is easy and getting information is easy and quick.
To sum up its good value and basic, but fits the bill.[QWERTY123]We have had a wonderfull experience in NYC. Sally is an open and educated woman. The place is basic. You have all the freedom you need and de subway is on the corner. Next time I go back to Sally[QWERTY123]It's was our firts experience Airbnb. The apartment is well located. The metro is very close. The neighborhood is quiet. Sally and Ssameer are accommodating. The room was small but OK for sleeping but the public rooms are not as clean as the ad says.[QWERTY123]Excellent value for the money, imagine a youth hostel but you get a private room. It is a tiny space (which is more or less irrelevant for NYC anyway) but very convenient if you are traveling on a budget and only need a place to crash at night. Sally is very nice and knowledgeable of the city, and Sameer was very quick to respond and accessible at all times. Thanks![QWERTY123]Good value for money and location is great. Sally was our main point of contact and her knowledge on New York City and its history is amazing! Keys are provided and no curfew. Some cleaning/tiding up required to make the place more appealing.[QWERTY123]I am very happy with the coice of ssamers appartment. The communication between ssamaer and me was great. I got the answers of my question very fast and helped as best as he could. Sally who lived there was very nice and polite. Her recommendations were good and i liked it to talk with her. Finally is this place very good for this price. Everything is exactly same how you see it on the pictures.[QWERTY123]I found my stay very enjoyable to say the very least and 
most importantly, I learned so much.[QWERTY123]One of the best accommodation in NYC. I like to come back hire. Sally was very hospitable and conversable.[QWERTY123]The hostess, ""Sally"" was very gracious.  I was a little uncomfortable with no curtain on the bedroom window, and none on the window in the shower.[QWERTY123]The reservation was canceled the day before arrival. This is an automated posting.[QWERTY123]Pros: Ssameer and Sally are quick to communicate 
Location- less than a block from the 1 and in a safe neighborhood. Many supermarkets and cafes nearby 

Cons: the place was dirty and messy but all you really need is a place to sleep and a restroom 

Overall great stay at this place, I would definitely recommend. Remember you get what you pay for, this is inexpensive homestay and not a hotel so don't have high expectations.[QWERTY123]Sally, who sees guests and lives there, was a fine host. As all the reviews have mentioned, the place is rather unhygienic. There's a lot of dust and bugs and lack of ventilation. There's also a strong stench. Also good to know that she has a dog there.[QWERTY123]Salli is excelent host, very kind, supportive and smart. She is really the main advantage of this place.[QWERTY123]Loved neighborhood and sally.[QWERTY123]This was my 5th stay (i think) with Ssameer and it still hasn't changed - which is GOOD. I keep on choosing this place every time I go visit Manhattan because of the following:
- location
- convenience 
- rate
- hospitality 
- safety (neighborhood)

Sally has always been a great company and host - considering she had broken her back a month ago or so. Incredible woman, at the same time very warm - always a delight. Always have my coffee every morning from her. I even met her son (Ben) who's very cool. Plus the adorable Zorro (doggie) made it more fun!

This place is perfect for short stay vacationers like me. 

I'm already planning to stay here for my Christmas vacay. 

Cheers Ssameer & Sally![QWERTY123]Sally was wonderful, learned a lot just from talking to her in the mornings. Seemed to be a lot of families in the neighborhood, which was very pleasant. Nice to see groups of people chilling out on the sidewalk in their lawn chairs just having a grand ol' time. It should be noted that while the picture for the room shows a bunk bed, the room we were given had only one double bed, which was unfortunate, but we made it work.[QWERTY123]Decent for the price. Sally was very nice and helped out with directions. Somewhat cramped and dirty. About a 30 min subway ride to midtown.[QWERTY123]Close to the subway so that is very cool. Sally is awesome and can help us find anything. Also it is clean a bit small but that's okay if you wanna visit New York. If I come back to New York for a few days I'll go back at that place. I recomand it.[QWERTY123]Una casa muy acogedora y aunque no estaba Ssameer, muy amable Sally, la señora que me atendió.
Está un poco lejos del centro de Manhattan pero afortunadamente está al lado del metro y no se tarda demasiado en llegar.
Todo muy bien, y si vuelvo por NY seguramente repita.[QWERTY123]I'm sorry to be writing this but it was the most dissatisfied I've ever been with an Airbnb experience. Sameer was never there and Sally, though she tried, fell woefully short in providing a comfortable place. Cramped, smelly, poorly ventilated room/ apt - it's quite literally a storage unit that being rented out to make a quick buck. The only positive aspect is, given the price, the location is good. Otherwise: living here can easily take the fun out of your NYC trip. And THAT is no mean feat. Utterly disappointed.[QWERTY123]We had a really easy and uncomplicated stay at this place. If you book, you get a little private room with two beds (just like in the pictures) and a lot of good advices. On top, the room is right next to the subway (two minutes walk), so you can reach anything in the city in a very easy way (and there is a supermarket a few seconds from the room). All in all a very good deal we would recommend.[QWERTY123]PROS: Samer and Sally are very nice and helpful and were flexible with the dates (we had to leave one day earlier because of our flight and Samer had no problem to return us money for that night)
Apartement is in calm neighborhood close to metro station 137 st (so close to Central Park - excelent position!) and is cheap and clean

CONS: The room is relatively small (as you can see on the picture)
There was a mouse in the apartment who ate some of our food which was not hidden in the fridge[QWERTY123]Location is great. It's near the subway, grocery store is even closer and some places to eat as well. We were two girls and we felt completely safe. We didn't see Ssameer a lot, but he did greet us and provided us with some useful information. Sally's really cool, very helpful. The room is very small, so if you need a lot of space, this is not for you.[QWERTY123]The house is good located and it has red(1) metro station, two supermarkets, pharmacy, McDonals, Dunkin Donuts in less than 5 minutes. This is the best along with the price.
The bedroom is small but enaught to sleep and the shower is very nice.
Our housemate Sally is very helpfull and polite. We only saw to Ssameer the first day and we don see him again.
Buy not all are good news, the home is not very clean and there are mouses; for that, you can left food in the bedroom. The scond night we have to wake up to throw all our food because the noise of the mouses was very hateful. Ssamaer knew it but did not seem to care.
[QWERTY123]All in all, the Place is well located but a Little small and dirty. If youre looking for a cheap Place to stay, its good for you. The host was very Nice and had some good advice where to eat in NY. But dont expect too much.[QWERTY123]I saw more of Sally than Ssameer but she was very friendly, and gave my friend and I advice on places to visit given our time and interests there.  Super close to the subway.  Tight squeeze for two, but it worked well[QWERTY123]Hôte accueillant et très sympa! J'ai vu sameer très peu. J'ai vu salie tt le temps et elle avait des supers conseils pour visiter ny! Chambre comme ds la description (petite et sommaire)imbattable niveau qualité /prix.C'était un excellent petit séjour avec de belles rencontres d'autres co locataires airbnb. Moments agréables.[QWERTY123]The reservation was canceled 15 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.[QWERTY123]Ssameer was a great host, he was extremely friendly and the room was very clean. I would definitely stay there again, or recommend this room to anybody looking for a great place to stay in New York City.[QWERTY123]Ssameer was so friendly and accommodating! He gives you the keys to his place so you can come and go as you wish. 

For a budget traveler, the location is fantastic. There's a McDonald's and a little grocery store  about a block away. The subway is conveniently close too.

It was a painless first Airbnb experience and I'd do it again if I find myself back in NYC.[QWERTY123]It's always awesome staying here and catching up with Ssameer & Sally![QWERTY123]Very good experience!!good temperature at home and the restroom is clean. location close to subway station. Very recomended.[QWERTY123]Ssameer is super sweet and welcoming. We would love to come back some day.[QWERTY123]Good[QWERTY123]My experience was very great in New York. Ssammer was quite kind with me and my friend. The best is that the metro station is so close that I had to walk just two blocks.[QWERTY123]This was a great place to stay in NYC! The room was clean, Sameer was friendly & helpful, the place is super-close to a subway station & grocery store, & I felt safe at all times, even walking back at 3 am. Highly recommended![QWERTY123]Accueil chaleureux. Quartier sympa. Métro pratique à 2 pas. Chambre un peu exiguë. Calme, silencieux, tranquille. Merci à Ssameer pour sa discussion et ses conseils judicieux.[QWERTY123]Our room was ready upon arrival and Sameer welcomed us and gave some recommendations on where to eat and tips to go around the city. The room is small but it works well for two people specially if you do not spend too much time in it. You get 4 different keys, including one to lock the bedroom. There is no curfew so you can walk in and out whenever you need to but don't forget to take your shoes off.

The apt is in West Harlem and is very easy to get there from LGA. We felt safe in the area. There is a lot of Latin American people and restaurants, try Flor de Broadway. The metro station is 2 blocks away and runs straight to Times Square.

Sameer let us do a late check out (around 3pm), letting us do some souvenir shopping before heading back to the airport. 

Overall was a good stay.[QWERTY123]Ssameer was super friendly and gave my friend & I a bunch of tips on where to go and eat in NYC. The only issue was the walls are pretty thin and it can get a little noisy in the back room, with sounds from the other apts/street coming in. However, the room was so cheap that it was totally worth it! Very conveniently located to the 1 metro line.[QWERTY123]When we arrived at Ssameer's place we were greeted with a smile and a very welcome vibe, exactly what we needed after a long bus ride. As we arrived very early there were other guests still in the room but Ssameer sat and chatted with us about the city and himself which was great. The place was homey and very accessible to transport and felt very safe. Once we came back from our day out, our room was clean and beds were very comfortable. A very enjoyable trip![QWERTY123]Ssameer was a great host. He gave us a lot of recommendations and helped us understand how to best use the subway to get around NYC. Although he was not always around (due to his work schedule), anytime he was around he was easy to talk to and made us feel welcome.[QWERTY123]Everything was great, even though we arrived very late Ssaameer was very welcoming and gave great advice about what to see in the city and the public transport. Though the room was quite small, it was very comfortable and had everything we needed. Great place to stay and a very nice host.[QWERTY123]Ssameer was great and really helpful. He gave us a lot of places to visite. Thanks again for the stay we had a great time :P[QWERTY123]Samer oli loistava isäntä. Tunsimme itsemme heti tervetulleiksi. Hän antoi paljon hyödyllistä tietoa New Yorkin kohteista ja oli aina valmis vastaamaan kysymyksiimme. Hänellä on selvästi kokemusta matkailijoiden majoittamisesta. Asunto sijaitsee rauhallisella alueella hyvien kulkuyhteyksien varrella, joten liikkuminen asunnon ja downtownin välillä on helppoa mihin vuorokauden aikaan tahansa. Elämä asunnossa on myös hyvin rauhallista. Tuntui kuin asuisimme omassa asunnossa :)[QWERTY123]Ssameer's place  is well connected with the subway (line 1 )
ssameer is a really good ""guide"" ; he gives you many useful tips especially regarding places to eat and drink good beers ;) 
He makes you feel at home (even if yours is 8000 kilometers away)
highly recommended!!!!!! :)[QWERTY123]Trip is a super nice guy with excellent recommendations on subway transitting, good food and, bonus if you like to drink, getting nice beer. His place is close to a subway station, approx. <5mins walk. His place is also close to everything -- restaurants are around his place, inexpensive but delicious; a supermarket nearby opens until midnight plus a 24-hour McDonald; laundry shop nearby. If you opt to cook during your stay, Trip is definitely an expert to help![QWERTY123]Small room as advertised, helpfull host. Personally we would have loved some more fresh air in the appartment[QWERTY123]Wir haben uns in der Wohnung sehr wohl gefühlt. Die Räume waren wie beschrieben. Jederzeit wieder würden wir dieses Angebot buchen.
[QWERTY123]Le logement a été parfaitement bien décrit, la chambre était comme sur la photo, nous avons été parfaitement accueillis dans l'appartement.[QWERTY123]Ssameer was very responsive and helpful both before and during our stay. Mitra welcomed us in person and made herself available for our later than expected arrival as well as made us feel welcome throughout our stay. The room was exactly as described and was all we needed for our visit. The location served us well right next to the 137th st. (City College) Station.[QWERTY123]The place was exactly as it was shown on the picture. Great location, near to the metro and fairly close to the sites we wanted to visit. However, we expected  the room cleaner than it was.[QWERTY123]Ssameer provided us useful & sympathic advices to reach his place. Unfortunately we didn't meet with him - an other person was here to welcome us. 
That seemed like a youth hostel where you had to help yourself alone. 
Relative cleanliness, no curtains, basic comfort for a basic price.
We had to clean the room (and also to put new sheets on the beds for the next guests) and the bathroom before to leave.[QWERTY123]Ssameer was very sweet, attentive and helpful in all of his communications with me. He offered a lot of tips on neighborhood and where to go, to eat, to shop and how to get there.

The apartment was just as described, no surprises or anything. Clean, all the basics are there. No kettle though, but you can boil water on the stove or buy your coffee in one of nearest coffee spots.

Very close to subway station, supermarkets, DianeReade for pharmacy and necessities, T-mobile shop for getting a local SIM card, good eateries.

Will stay at Ssameer's place again and recommend it to others.[QWERTY123]La chica que nos recibió, Mitra, muy amable y muy educada. En el baño me encontré una cucaracha cada dia que pase allí y apart tuvimos ciertos inconvenientes a la hora de dejar las llaves al siguiente inquilino, porque el dueño no apareció en ningun momento y nos tuvimos que encargar nosotros de darselas en un transporte publico de la ciudad[QWERTY123]Le logement était exactement comme décrit dans l'annonce, on a eu un très bon contact avec Ssameer. Bien qu'il ne soit pas présent il était toujours disponible pour répondre au moindre de nos soucis et nous a mis en contact avec une personne sur place.
L'appartement était de plus parfaitement situé, à 2 pas du métro.[QWERTY123]A very nice place to stay if you are visiting NYC. Apartment is very close to subway staion - 1 line will take you to Central Park, Times square or any other place in Manhattan! Place has a real New York feeling and has all the essential things for your stay. Neighbourhood is mostly very quiet, but even when it gets louder in weekend, it still is fun! Beds were comfortable, but put your alarms on - as the room doesn't get much light - you might miss when the morning has come and sleep too much :) Thanks, for hosting![QWERTY123]I didn't get the opportunity to meet Trip sadly, but I did meet Mitra -who lives at the apartment - she is a lovely lady.  The apartment is in a great spot, very close to the subway and bus stops.  The bed is pretty comfortably and the apartment nice and clean and tidy.  The shower was lovely and hot and the apartment was warm.[QWERTY123]During my stay, I didn't meet Ssamer but I met Mitra. She has been really helpful throughout my stay in New York. The location is really great as it is near supermarket and metro.[QWERTY123]駅からとても近く(2分くらい?)ﾏｯｸとｽｰﾊﾟｰがあります｡

[QWERTY123]Muy limpio, buena ubicacion y ambiente :) la cama hacia un poco de ruido al dormir y moverse pero mas alla de eso todo fue genial :) gracias![QWERTY123]It is quite value. Sameer know New York very well. The way he recommend to the hotel is much shorter than (Hidden by Airbnb) map.[QWERTY123]Ssammer was not in New York when we arrived, and fortunately his roommate was there, since he misunderstood our check in. Indeed, luckily she was there and she gave us the keys and everything. The room is ok, but however the light wakes me up every morning very early, since there are not real curtains. The bathroom is ok and the location is very close to the 137th subway station (1), which allowed us to reach the Manhattan center in 20/30 minutes[QWERTY123]I rented the back room, which had the bunk beds.  The location, accommodations and hostess (roommate on duty Haya) was exactly as listed.  The check in went perfectly without any glitches. She was beyond kind and gracious. I was hardly in the flat, but when I was there, the majority of the time I had the place to myself. There was another party of two that checked in a few days into my 9 day stay and occupied the front private room. Since I live with my adult kids, I didn't mind sharing a restroom, which was not an inconvenience whatsoever. For the cost, this was a perfect booking for me. I also am glad to say I met a lifelong friend in Haya. She did not treat me like a stranger renting a room, but more like a tenant, which made me feel very welcomed in her home.[QWERTY123]The place was ok. Indications were just excelent to get into the house. The host in charge was so helpful and kind. I like the place because it is near to a metro station and could move around Manhatan with ease.

Great place.

Thank you[QWERTY123]I enjoyed my stay at Ssameer's place. Didn't get to meet Ssameer, but Hang, who was the host for May, was great. Hang is always there to help if you have any questions. The room can feel small at first glance. But I used the lower bed as storage place, and slept on the top bed. It worked out for me very well.[QWERTY123]Great experience staying here, and it was exactly what I wanted and expected.  Very convenient being so close to the subway and bus routes.  Hang, who lives there and acts as hostess, is delightful ... very friendly and helpful.  I will definitely be back on my next NYC trip.[QWERTY123]I was warmly welcomed by Hang - the girl currently living in the apt. She showed me the room that completely answered our expectations. The environment both in the apartment and the neighborhood were quiet and easy[QWERTY123]Nous avons été très bien accueillis par Hang. La chambre correspond tout à fait à la description. A recommander[QWERTY123]3 mins walk away from subway, 1 mins away from grocery store, and couple of restaurants around this area. Safe neighborhood. And the host's roommate Hang is such a sweet girl. Definitely will come back if I ever go to NY again.[QWERTY123]What a pleasant experience. Ssameer was so accommodating, his direction of best public transportation & how to get here is awesome. The onsite care-taker Ms. Hang was very caring, responsive, so friendly. She respected our privacy at the same time made us feel like home, indeed she made our short visit wonderful. The apartment is located on the first floor (So no stair required) & in a peaceful surrounding area with many local restaurants, street vendors, food markets & a DR pharmacy nearby. A few walks through the tiny park & the subway stop at 137th St/City college can take you places. The minimal room I stayed is private, comfy & basically has everything I needed (Window, wifi, keyed-in lock, bulk bed w/clean sheet/blanket, pillow, closet space with hangers, desk fan, electric socket). A clean shared-bathroom, living/dining area & open kitchen with everything for a quick meal are all yours.  I'd highly recommend Ssameer's place without hesitation, thank you so much![QWERTY123]It is a super nice place in a really good location. It's close to the subway and there is a supermarket just a few steps away. The host was super helpful and nice! I would book this room again![QWERTY123]Best possible way to stay in Manhattan cheaply. You're very close to the subway that can take you anywhere you need to go in New York. 

Highly recommend staying here.[QWERTY123]This place is perfect for visiting New York on a budget. It's very close to the subway, which takes you downtown in 15-20 minutes. The host, Hang was very nice and very helpful (thank you!). Another great thing about this listing is the flexible check-in and check-out time (we arrived after midnight). We didn't have the chance to meet Ssameer, but he was friendly and responsive and made sure everything is okay before our arrival. He also offers detailed instructions on getting to the apartment from any airport. I would definitely reccomend this place! :)[QWERTY123]Didn't get to meet Trip but Ms Hang was friendly & helpful. Place is exactly as described, convenient location, no complaints at all.[QWERTY123]Didn't get to meet Trip but Hang was helpful and fun. The place is perfect if you are looking just for a bed to sleep, great location 2 blocks from the subway with markets and restaurants nearby. 
Not your place if you're concerned about order and cleanliness .[QWERTY123]Sameer was traveling during our stay but his friend took good care of us. The room looks exactly like on the photo, kitchen and bathroom were nice. Just a few steps from subway which makes it a great location. For tha price it's a great accomodation.[QWERTY123]Great location! Hang was really nice but we didn't get to hang out with her that much. Trip was also friendly and helped us with helpful tips to make our trip even better. The room was small and not very clean, but with the low price we didn't really have high expectations for it anyway. Overall a great place to stay if you want value and a perfect location![QWERTY123]This place was exactly as described. The people were great, location was super safe and super close to transit stations. Ssameer has a huge heart and you can totally tell from the moment you walk through the door, all the way until you leave. If you haven't ever been to NYC before I would recommend you stay here because Ssameer was very knowledgeable and helpful doesn't even do him justice. Atmosphere was great, super clean, hot water in the showers everyday, and just and overall awesome experience. Planning on staying here again next time I visit the city if it's still available![QWERTY123]Trip's apartment is a must go to if you are travelling alone or with a buddy. The apartment was super clean, cosy and you feel like a local living there. Everything was a walk away and public transport was in arm's reach. I highly recommend Trip's apartment for not only your stay but also his personality. Trip is the most down-to-Earth person and is a delight to be around. Him, his wife and his roommate Hang was so helpful and overall great company. I will definitely come back to Trip's apartment if i'm visiting New York again.[QWERTY123]Sameer was very helpful and the location was great![QWERTY123]Convenient location and really really cozy room. Trip is very kind and helpful. Excellent stay I have had.[QWERTY123]The cockroach in the bathroom wasn't the worst part, since this is NYC and that's to be expected from time to time. What was most frustrating was not only did Trip and Hang live there, but Hang's parents were also living there for the last 2 months. The apartment is tiny and foam comfortably accommodate 3 people, but 5 was super cramped. You couldn't use the living room because someone was always asleep on the sofa or watching television since the parents don't know anyone in NYC or speak English. If two of you tried to prepare your dinner at once, the power would go out, and only 2 of the 4 burners on the stove work. I always had to wash the silverware before I used it because there were bits of food left over from the last time someone ""washed"" it. There were never any paper towels, but only dirty rags to clean up with. The mother complained that she had to wipe the water off the counter after I washed my dishes, and when I asked them to buy paper towels, I was told that I should chip into the apartment and get them myself. Excuse me? Aren't I the guest? There was also never any soap, just an old dish soap bottle that kept getting refilled with water. The whole apartment smelt like mold, it was so bad you could smell it from the hallway outside the apartment. The shower curtain especially stank and was stiff and crusty. There was a cockroach in the bathroom, but that wasn't as annoying as having to constantly pull other people's hair out of the shower drain. Also, the kitchen sink was broken, and the solution was to superglue the faucet back together. So every time you drink water, it has run over some superglue. Sticky. There are so many little things like this that don't seem like a big deal but all added up it made for a really frustrating experience. The apartment is only located by 1 train, that train is often under repair. I lived here for 4 weeks as I made my move back to NYC, and for 3 of those weeks the train was down by the time I got out of work, so I would have to take 2 trains and a bus just to get home from Times Square. It's not a convenient or fun commute, especially at 1am in February. Trip was only at the apartment the first 4 days. Then he moved to his parents place so that other people could rent out his 3rd room. I've done Airbnb all around the world and this didn't feel like I was being welcomed in someone's home but instead like an expensive hostel or bad sublet. The value here is terrible. When I first voiced my concerns, Trip offered to buy me a bottle of wine and cook me dinner instead of trying to fix the problems. When I later asked for a...[QWERTY123]Everything was very uncomplicated. We had a nice stay for one week. A supermarket, bars, delis, restaurants are in the near surrounding of the flat. It was a good stay for not a lot of money :)[QWERTY123]Ssamer was very helpful and communicated with myself and my friend from the very start. Very friendly and helpful in making sure we got to the apartment with ease. The room worked well, and the beds where conformable if a bit small. Definitely nothing fancy but if you need a place to store your stuff and sleep at night I would highly recommend it.[QWERTY123]Great location from the 1 train! Easy and stress free host and location. Small room, but very comfortable and even closet space! I would absolutely stay here again.[QWERTY123]Logement très agréable, très confortable , proche du métro donc très pratique .[QWERTY123]We had a great stay at Trip and Hung's! Both of them are very friendly and uncomplicated :-) the apartment is just around the subway so that it is not a problem at all to get anywhere! 

Also for that money it is totally ok that the bathroom wasn't the cleanest:) 

We had a great stay and when we go to New York next time we would definitely go back to Trip :)[QWERTY123]Everything at Trip's place worked well! It is close to the subway and very few stops from the main tourist attractions. The neighborhood also features plenty of non-franchise places to eat, and laundromats for those extended stays.[QWERTY123]The place is really nice. The room is cozy but is equipped with all the things you need. The place is near to the subway station. It's 10 minutes to Columbia University and 20 minutes to Time Square. It's really convenient for everyone to live there. There is a supermarket near the appartement and there's also a McDonald. Trip and Hang are kind and helpful. They gave us many suggestions on public transits and traveling destinations. We had fun there.[QWERTY123]Chambre identique aux photos, salle de bain, WC, et cuisine en commun avec la locataire principale. Stationnement non privatif dans la rue, attention aux différentes règles de stationnement, s'armer de patience mais gratuit. Logement propre et communication très rapide avec le propriétaire que l'on n'a jamais vu.[QWERTY123]Everything was there when we needed it and more. It was a few minutes off from the train and was very convenient to get around. Overall your experience was great.[QWERTY123]Very near to the subway and a supermarket. Silent at night, maybe in the afternoon you can hear music (fortunately, pretty good music). The room is tiny but has all the essential. Trip is very kind and he can give you some advice on where to eat and where to go. Not too far from the heart of Manhattan.[QWERTY123]Ssameer was not there but his lovely roommate made the check-in and stay very smooth! Communication was consistent and quick, I'd highly recommend booking and will likely try to stay here again when I'm back in NYC.[QWERTY123]위치가 좋았다 지하철에서 1분거리라는점에서 말이다[QWERTY123]a perfect place to sleep in manhattan! near to the subway, best for young people who don't want to pay a lot for a room![QWERTY123]Ssameer is a helpful and welcoming host. The place is small, but it worked for my friend and I. We just wanted a place to crash for the night, and it met my expectations.[QWERTY123]First off, Trip and Hong were amazing hosts. Their communication was on point the entire time. 

The place was okay, the fan in the room didn't make up for the lack of ac. I expected it to be a small room but it was even smaller than expected. 

However, it served it's purpose as a place I could stay until I found an apartment.[QWERTY123]I like here.Everything is much better than i imagine . The owner is so kind, everything is so great . The location is so perfect, just about 3 minutes' walk to the subway,1 minute's walk to supermarket ![QWERTY123]Merci pour l'offre de la chambre qui est conforme aux photos et surtout très bien placé dans le quartier d'Harlem qui est très agréable pour sortir, se balader ou manger.
Pour des personnes simple cherchant un lieu pour se reposer et se laver durant le séjour à New York.[QWERTY123]Easy communication upfront and great location in upper New York. Subway and supermarkets are just closeby. Would recommend for anybody who wants to explore New York and needs a cheap place to sleep.[QWERTY123]지하철역에서 가까워서 좋았습니다. 매우 저렴한 가격에 숙박할수 있었던 점이 만족[QWERTY123]Perfect place, close to metro, room is spacier than you think, with hanging closet and coat rack. But bring flip flop, there are small insects in the bathroom and kitchen.[QWERTY123]Bon rapport qualite prix
On est tres vite a time square / manhattan[QWERTY123]Meets the description. Easy in and out.[QWERTY123]Hinta-laatu kohdillaan ja asunto sijaitsee hyvien kulkuyhteyksien varrella. Huone oli aika pieni, mutta eipä siellä kauheasti tule vietettyä aikaa muutakun nukkuessa.[QWERTY123]Ssameer's place is in a great location right next to the 1 line. You can get dowtown in about 20 minutes. Easy to get around, got some local deli's & food. Hang (room mate) was really nice and helped get us situated. The apartment was quite and beds were fine. Great place to stay if you want to stay in NY.[QWERTY123]The 1 train was a short walk away which was great - right by a mcdonalds which was open 24 hrs. Never felt unsafe in the area, even past 2am. The host was not there but roommates kept to themselves and was not a disturbance. Host did communicate quickly when we had questions. Great location for the price and would definitely recommend staying if you are looking to be out the majority of the stay.[QWERTY123]The host, Trip, was very responsive and made our late-night check-in really easy. The instructions on how to get to the flat from the Newark airport, in our case, were very detailed and got us there quickly and inexpensively. One of the (Hidden by Airbnb) we met, Hang, was super nice, friendly and helpful. The place is a one minute walk away from the metro station and there’s an LG Laundry Lounge half a block away (Phone number hidden by Airbnb) Amsterdam Ave) that works with a card so no need for tons of quarters. A great place for a budget trip.[QWERTY123]Overall a good budget place close to the subway. Please be aware that it is a small room (narrow) as shown in the pictures. 
Excellent communication and good helpful hosts. Hang was excellent helping us settle down quickly.[QWERTY123]WLAN funktionierte nicht, mussten lange auf eine Antwort warten bei Ankunft und schließlich die Schlüssel selber abholen
Nach anfänglichen Schwierigkeiten dann gut.[QWERTY123]This is a great, cozy, and well-located place. Train stations for the 1, A, and C are nearby, and so are various buses that go further down Manhattan.

The hosts were prompt, lovely, and helpful. I definitely plan on staying here again during my next time in NYC.[QWERTY123]Nous avions loué pour 13 nuits nous en sommes rester seulement 2 (si ça n’avait tenu qu’à nous, nous serions repartis directement) 
Le logement est terriblement sale (moisissure, poussières, poils et cheveux partout, crasse, désordre...) 
La chambre est minuscule et le lit n’est vraiment pas stable, nous avons eut peur qu’il s’effondre.
Les serrures de cet appartement sont défectueuses, impossible de rentrer à l’intérieur du logement (nous somme rester coincé plusieurs fois) sans quelqu’un a l’intérieur impossible s’ouvrir la porte d’entrée. Les autres serrures sont également très capricieuses (mais ouvrables)
Il y a aussi beaucoup de nuisances sonores.
Je déconseille vivement, à moins que la crasse ne vous dérange pas.[QWERTY123]Wonderful![QWERTY123]This place was a great value in a great location! Would stay here again.[QWERTY123]DO NOT STAY HERE. It was cheap, but also had a constant smell of rotten food and milk, none of the windows could be opened (including the one in my room to the fire escape—serious fire hazard). The bathroom was disgusting and my sheets were stained with old blood.

Ssameer wasn’t even present, and the woman he hired to take care of the place had never met him. From what I can deduce, he uses this dingy apartment to rake in cash while he lives on  another continent. 

The trash cans were not regularly taken out and always smelled. It was next to impossible to find clean dishes. I have used AirBnb with great results in the past, but this was the worst place I’ve ever stayed. A pay by the hour motel is probably more pleasant, cleaner and with more amenities than this place. Can’t believe it had 5 stars.[QWERTY123]Basically you get what you paid for. 
Even though it wasn't very clean (in the room and the shared bathroom), the place is well located for a city like New York and cheap (otherwise you would pay twice or 5 times the price to get closer to the south of Central Park). It is within 2 minutes walk from the metro station (number 2) which goes to Time Square and all the way down to Manhattan and Brooklyn. The neighboorhood was ok and we didn't have any issue during the 2 weeks we stayed there. There are shops nearby and a McDonald open 24/7 for those in need of food after a long day of visiting.
The room is small (as described in the ad) when there are 2 people with 2 big luggage, but otherwise it was fine.
Trip and Maggie were nice and really quick to respond and provided accurate information to get to the place, how to check-in and how to check-out.[QWERTY123]Not too many frills but really convenient place to stay if you plan on taking the Metro![QWERTY123]Fantastic budget option in an interesting exciting neighborhood in Manhattan. The Host was wonderful and kind.
 I couldn't ask for a better stay with a quiet relax vibration in a private room."	40.82130179610574	-73.95318340801697	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/9783	2	50.0	0.84

Perfection![QWERTY123]Great location, typical NY apt, it’s not the best room in the world, but it was certainly great for me.[QWERTY123]Trip was an attentive host who checked in on how I was doing via messages. Any sort of  issues he would try and sort out as soon as possible. Although I did not meet Trip, I met with the co-host Maggie who is lovely. 

This room has a comfy bed and the location is very convenient. The apartment was less than a minute away from the 1 subway line.[QWERTY123]La ubicacion es excelente, esta en el primer nivel cosa que fue muy buena ya que llegas muy cansado a dormir, la comunicacion con el anfitrion fue muy rapida y hay un food market en la esquina que vende de todo y cruzando la cuadra hay una estacion de metro que es la city college, no saliamos de time square y alrededores.
Si me volveria a hospedar en este lugar.[QWERTY123]excellent value place to stay while in NYC. would stay again. note that the bed is close to the ceiling so don't sit up when you wake up ;-)[QWERTY123]Reserving my review to see how they handle a partial refund.[QWERTY123]You get what you pay for. I'm not excited about the place at all but it is very affordable, at a good location and the host is quick and responsive in his communication(thanks Ssameer!)[QWERTY123]Nice place to stay."	40.822785418362535	-73.9513872461774	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/22918	2	60.0	0.816667
76	10452	"i really liked it here. the carpet/flooring of the place is worn (though surely clean), as age happens, so i wore flipflops and it was fine. very clean and convenient location. i had the privacy in my spacious room, with big windows, and a TV and enough furniture. the kitchen was shared but everyone kept it clean and i had total access. just what i needed! the mattress is nothing to rave about, but despite my bad back, i survived adequately. if i can borrow another blanket (i tend to get cold at night), which i think will not be a problem, i think i'll come back here to stay next time i'm in nyc for sure! for the price, what you get is very, very reasonable, and angela is very responsive and professional.[QWERTY123]Some things I really liked about the apartment were the spacious and well furnished room, big screen TV, and a fast internet wireless connection. The housekeeping service was also good but was available only once a week. Kitchen was very well maintained and have all basic utensils, cutlery, refrigerator, stove, and oven. But the fact that it is shared between three rooms and is cleaned only once a week was a challenge at times. The location of the apartment was pretty good, it was quite close to the subway and took just 10 mins from Chambers St. by Subway to transit to Manhattan.The single shared bathroom was a little challenging at time especially since I had to leave early morning. Overall I liked the apartment and enjoyed my stay![QWERTY123]Pleasure to stay at her Angela's room share. The room was fantastic and clean just as i expected. No surprises. I would definitely suggest Angela to host to anyone visiting New York. I had a blast![QWERTY123]The location is so great, 25 mins to midtown. Just three blocks to the Franklin Ave. station. The room is very clean and Angela provides all stuffs that I need. I had a good experience living here.[QWERTY123]Angela's place was great. It's the perfect place for anyone looking to stay in NYC temporarily or even for long-term and need a reasonably priced place to live. It was always clean and well-maintained. It's just two blocks from the C train (one of the better subways) and very close to convenience stores, groceries and laundromats. Overall a great experience. Highly recommended![QWERTY123]I booked the place but was not able to stay due to urgent trip. However Angela responded quickly and all the information was correct.[QWERTY123]This place is exactly like the pics, beautiful interior, clean and quiet. The location is not the safest late nights, but convenient to transportation. Only negative is the frequency of cleaning, it's only once a week and that isn't always enough for 4 people. Otherwise my 3 weeks stay was great.[QWERTY123]It felt like home! It was so comfortable and clean! Felt like I was living in my own apartment. It was a convenient location and the best part was laundry in the building! The place was as nice as the pictures. Angela is a perfect host. She is trusting and helpful! When I asked to extend my stay an extra week, she was very cooperative. I look forward to staying there again[QWERTY123]Great place! Our room was spacious, equipped with our own cable TV, comfortable bed, couch and air-conditioner which worked a treat! The kitchen was communal, but very well organised and clean, and a great place to meet other guests. Bathrooms clean and nice hot showers. Location was good, close to subway for all your touristy needs, About a 15 min ride into Downtown Manhattan. Great priice for NYC![QWERTY123]+ We contacted Angela just about a week before the day of our arrival and she replied immediatly. 

+ The room we stayed in the most of the time was large and clean. We first were given a smaller room which wasn't just as nice (the wall between that and the other room seemed to be as thin as a paper). Anyway, staying in the other room, we felt like we had all the privacy we needed and it didn't bother us to share the bathroom and the kitchen with other guests.  

+ Location is convinient - just like we expected. 

+ The general atmosphere was all very relaxed and homy at Angela's place. The guy, Chaz, who works for Angela, is very helpful and easy-going and takes care of everything. 

+ Angela was very flexible with us and let us store our luggage there after check out time.  Overall we enjoyed our stay very much.[QWERTY123]The location is very close to the subway, so it's easy to get wherever you need to go. The building is clean and has a washer & dryer for only $1.50 each, so a pretty good deal if you stay long enough to require doing laundry. There is a ton of closet space, so you can easily store your stuff. Overall a pretty comfortable place to stay in a great neighborhood.[QWERTY123]The rooms are great, the neighborhood is safe, and Angela makes sure you have everything you need! If I ever come back to New York, I will definitely stay here again.[QWERTY123]I arrived at Angela's B&B style room on Franklin Avenue in the driving rain, an hour early, but after a quick call to Angela the superintendent was over in 20 minutes. I stayed in the apartment over Thanksgiving break. It was perfect! It's a room to sleep in, which was all I needed. The subway is like two blocks away, and the neighborhood is not terrible (check out the Daily Press, a coffee place on the way to the subway). Didn't really see anything of the other residents, so it pretty much felt like an apartment to myself.[QWERTY123]Angela has an interesting setup that works pretty well. I've been getting along reasonably well with the (Hidden by Airbnb) , the C train being 3 blocks away is very convenient, the neighborhood-- while not super nice-- is safe. There's a deli/grocery across the street that's cheap and good. All in all I'd stay again.[QWERTY123]The place was more or less exactly as I expected standard-wise. Everything was clean and well-kept, and both Angela and Cas (the 'house-keeper') were friendly and service-minded. The place is also close to the Metro and has a fairly well-sorted supermarket close by. The only minus might be for anyone who has a problem sleeping as the area was a bit noisy night-time.[QWERTY123]Angela's is a great place to stay! The room was clean and very cozy. The apartment has a great kitchen area and bathroom. The neighborhood is nice, the subway is only a few blocks away. I recommend this place also for long-term stays. I would definitely go back there.[QWERTY123]Estuvimos en la primera semana de Abril, muy buen espacio, muy limpio y acogedor. Lo bueno esque está muy cerca del metro donde uno puede por muy pocos dolares recorrer Manhattan. Definitivamente nos quedariamos nuevamente en este lugar. No conocimos a Angela, pero Cass nos facilitó todas las cosas. Recomendamos este lugar con toda seguridad..

[QWERTY123]Thank you Angela. Your home was wunderful. It was located central and we we felt very safe. Next year we will come back

Birgit and Niklas from Germany[QWERTY123]best place to be in NYC....all nice and clean and big enough for two.. connection to the subway...  my first choice, always[QWERTY123]We stayed at Angela's for 6 nights. It was two of us girls. I asked for early check in, there was no problem. Angela is very flexible with The check in & check out time. Just let her know in advance. During our stay we cooked a couple meals. The rule is simple, you use it, you clean it. We shared the entire apartment with may be a couple of people but the privacy is not an issue at all. I never have to wait for bathroom, kitchen or anything. It was never in use when I needed it. 

We did use a washer and dryer, keep your quarters. You gonna need 6 quarters for washer and the same thing for dryer. 

Subway is 5 mins walk to C train. From there, you can transfer to anywhere. Just a tips for a first time visitor like us, get the unlimited 7 days metro card. So you don't have to worry about refilling your card. 

On the way to subway, when you walk on the left hand side of street heading toward Fulton st/Franklin Ave station, you will find a cute coffee shop called Daily Press, grab a cup of coffee before you head down to subway. Their latte is amazing.

We are grateful for our stay. No problem, no hiccups whatsoever. 

Thank you, Angela![QWERTY123]Where we stayed was not the place shown in the pictures. I was very disappointed in the state of the place - it was quite dirty. The doors were all sticky with dirt, the carpets were trashed, and the bathroom smelled like a college dorm bathroom.

That said, for $50/night, it's not a terrible value. The A/C worked great, which is important for NYC in the summer, and our sheets and towels were fresh and clean. The person who greeted us was very nice and made sure we had enough clean towels, two sets of keys, etc.

Although in a relatively sketchy neighborhood, the place felt very secure. If you decide to stay here, make sure you don't get lost - we almost got robbed after we took a wrong turn from the Subway station a few blocks from the place.

If you're doing NYC on a budget, this is a suitable option.[QWERTY123]The apartment we got wasn't the same shown in the pictures. Also turned out to be shared apartment which was not stated in the description. We also got to pay an additional fee of $20 due to late check-out though it said flexibel check-out in the listing. Beside that everything was ok.[QWERTY123]We had a great stay at Angela's B&B style rooms!  Our room was spacious, clean and cheery.  The bathroom was also very clean.  Although the entire three floor house seems to have rooms, we rarely encountered anyone.  Angela and Cass were very accommodating and made sure we had everything we needed (including toothpaste)!

As for the location, it is great and we encountered no problems (even coming home late at night).  Lots of neat restaurants and other areas are within walking distance.   The subway stop is a 5 minute walk away and the ride into midtown Manhattan takes 15 minutes.  All in all, a great place to spend your time in NYC if you are looking to stay somewhere outside of the norm![QWERTY123]Everything is fine, silent neighborhood and subway is close to home. Bed is large and Angela is very helpful. Nice to know her.[QWERTY123]We, three friends, spent entire seven days in that lovely appartement. And in the end we kind of felt like home there. 

* About the appartement: Everything was clean, Angela supplied us with towels, shampoo etc. The kitchen is equipped with everything you might need. If you are travelling in a group of 3 or 4 persons the bedroom could get a little narrow - but because of the huge kitchen which works fine as a living room, we didn't mind.

* About the area/neighborhood: You definitely notice that the area gets slowly gentrified by the folks up from Williamsburg - so you have really nice and hip restaurants around you (--> 'DUN' and 'The Black Swan' are awesome. The distance to the subway is about a five minute walk. There you got trains up to Manhattan and down to JFK and the Rockaway 24/7. But if you are going to do a 'Manhattan trip' you should consider that it takes about 30/40 minutes with the C-Train to places like Times Square or 53rd/5th.

All in all: A lovely appartement in an up and coming area with convenient connections around the clock![QWERTY123]Staying at Angela's apartment was great! She kindly waited for us to arrive from a delayed flight at night. Spacious kitchen with everything you need to cook, clean bathroom and cozy bedroom. We stayed 3 people for 9 nights! Lots of space to keep your luggage. The neighborhood is great, silent at night, there's a supermarket and a cozy cafeteria nearby. The subway is only a few blocks away and a 15-20 min ride to Manhattan. If possible I would stay here again. Thank you Angela! :D[QWERTY123]We had a great time at the B&B style rooms in Brooklyn. It is a save neighborhood. The apartment is clean and you have everything you need. Angela was really helpful with everything and was available 24h. We can just recommend the apartment.[QWERTY123]I had a great time at Angela's place. In an overwhelming city like NY it was great to have a place that feels like home in a safe neighborhood. It was clean, comfortable and very close to the subway. In addition, Angela  is a very attentive and generous host. I felt that she tried her best to keep the apartment so pleasant.
Next time in NYC I'll be happy to come back to Angela's.[QWERTY123]Angela is an extremely attentive host and goes to great lengths to ensure that each of her guests has an enjoyable stay. The room in which I stayed was very spacious and had a walk-in closet with more room for clothing than most any traveler will need.

There's an organic market directly across from the apartment and a larger supermarket 0.2 miles away on Fulton. There's a C line stop just down the street, so it's very convenient to reach Manhattan by subway.

The neighborhood itself was nice. There are a handful of cafes within walking distance, and the people I met were very friendly. I walked home late at night many times and always felt safe.

Overall, highly recommended if you're coming to New York. I'll definitely consider booking again whenever I'm in the area.[QWERTY123]We had a very nice stay here. Angela is very nice and helpful, the room was nice and clean, so was the kitchen and the bathroom, it really felt like  a home. The neighbourhood is safe and there is a supermarket nearby and some fastfood joints (I recommend Crown Fried Chicken). Close to Prospect Park and the Brooklyn Botanic Garden, which are very nice and close to the subway which will get you to the upper east side in an hour and to downtown manhattan in half an hour.[QWERTY123]Appartement très bien placé, bien entretenu, l'accueil est très chaleureux...

A conseiller![QWERTY123]Angela is an exceptionally friendly and helpful host.The place is well run and clean and an excellent location for a short stay in New York.[QWERTY123]Très grande chambre et espace commun propre et spacieux également. À 5min a pied du métro C qui mène au centre de Manhattan en 30min environ. Seul défaut: impossible de régler le chauffage de la chambre donc chaleur obligeant de déformer la fenêtre ouverte... Je conseille cet appartement[QWERTY123]The reservation was canceled the day before arrival. This is an automated posting.[QWERTY123]My 1st experience on airbnb for a long stay : more than 1 month.
Well located, clean and very cozy.
Angela has been a great host, easy to contact and very helpful 
Léa[QWERTY123]Angela is great! The room was nice and air-conditioned -- with one of the most comfortable beds ever. And the cleaning lady was amazing. I've already been here for a month and have had no issues. Angela is really responsive and will usually text back very quickly.[QWERTY123]The room was lovely and big. Nice area, which is very close to the train station. Angela cleans and changes linens every week, so the place was always clean. Recommended.[QWERTY123]We had a great two weeks at Angela's place. We found a nice clean room, well furnished just perfect for our stay. We even had access to a small garden which was a nice surprise. 449 Franklin Ave is easily accessible by subway (A and C trains/Franklin Ave stop) either from JFK airport or from Manhattan. So it's very easy and convenient to go to Manhattan or to other places in Brooklyn. 
If we decide to go to NYC again we will definitely try to stay at Angela's place again.[QWERTY123]Me and my boyfriend stayed at Angela's for 3 nights.
Angela was very helpful on how to get around in the neighbourhood. The room was nice and very private. The neighbourhood might seem a bit rough at first sight but it is safe and you don't have to worry walking home at night. The apartment was clean and in good condition. There are 2 metro stops within walking distance and lots of places to eat.
I'd definitely stay there again if I come to New York. This place has everything you'd want: nice host, large room, very well connected, places to eat out, 24h deli just across the street![QWERTY123]Un accueil parfait !
La chambre est à deux pas du métro, à 10-15 min de Manhattan,  donc une situation idéale pour un prix mini (pour NYC).
La chambre est grande, la cuisine bien équipée, la salle de bain est nickel. En cas de problème et questions, Angela est super disponible et très réactive. Bref, un séjour idéal !
Seul petit hic pour les sensibles au bruit, cette chambre donne sur la rue....mais rien de bien méchant.[QWERTY123]It was really good, and the appartment very clean and Angela very kind and helpful. The neighborhood is dynamic with a lot of nice cafés and bars. It's near to the metro, we had a wonderful days there. I recomend it.[QWERTY123]C'est un lieu parfait pour rester sur New York !
A proximité des lignes C et G, et des lignes 2, 3, 4, 5, B et Q grâce au shuttle. En 20 minutes on est à Manhattan.
La chambre est grande, propre, non bruyante et le ménage et les draps sont faits toutes les semaines.
Angela est là pour vous accueillir, pour répondre à vos questions si besoin.
Des commerces et supermarchés à proximité pour faire ses courses, une salle de sport à 5 min à pied, quelques magasins de vêtements à moins de 10 minutes à pied.
La proximité des transports, et la qualité du logement est vraiment bien par rapport au prix. 
Un séjour très agréable.[QWERTY123]The reservation was canceled 12 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.[QWERTY123]The reservation was canceled 14 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.[QWERTY123]The apartment is great the room is really big, the kitchen is well equipped and is really close to the subway, markets and restaurants. The area is really safe  Angela is a great host, very kind and helpful. I really recommend this place. 
[QWERTY123]Me and my friends really had a great time in Angela's place. Angela is very nice and helpful. The neighborhood is very nice too! Her place is close to subway station. Thanks a lot![QWERTY123]Welcome to Angela's NYC beginner's Inn. The location is at it's prime and the hostess at Brooklyn's best. Here you will find numerous oversea travellers, some are here for fun, some are taking a shot at the big apple, some already working in New York and we all share drinks around the table. Angela cleans the house almost too much (but that's how we liked it!) and she is super attentive to your needs to make your journey more comfortable. If you want to experience living in Brooklyn, then Angela's place is a good place to start. 

The area is safe, and it comes with two deli grocery convenient stores within 1 min reach. At night it's surprisingly quiet even when Fulton Street comes to life. The fridge has a big enough space for everybody, and there's in-house washer and dryer.

Chris[QWERTY123]Angela is a great host. Everything is provided and ready. The neighborhood is absolutely convenient -- 3 mins walk to the train station, 2 mins to the library, 3 mins to YMCA. Definitely a great place to stay, both long and short. Thank you for everything Angela![QWERTY123]Great host that had a very good communication. The apartment is nice and in a convenient neighborhood in walking distance from many nice restaurants etc. We had a great time![QWERTY123]We stayed for 7 days with Angela. The experience was way beyond perfect. Considering the price, location, privacy and hospitality of the host, I would definitely recommend the place for travelers.[QWERTY123]Angela was a great host! The neighborhood was wonderful I felt very safe. Subway was a 4 minute walk from the apartment![QWERTY123]It's a great location in New York! And the bed is so comfortable![QWERTY123]Angela was the best host to stay with. Her apartment was kept incredibly clean- the rooms, bathroom, the kitchen, everything. it was also so close to the subway- literally 2 blocks. It was a wonderful location and not too far from Manhattan. There were also 2 deli stores 10 feet from the front door so that was also sweet deal. Angela was incredibly friendly and cleaned so much of the apartment every week. Truly a fine person to stay with if you're visiting/dropping by New York!! Thanks so much Angela. :)[QWERTY123]Muchas gracias a Angela por su espacio , todo calefaccionado, ordenado y limpio.

Me gustó mucho todo y lo mejor es que esta cerca de una estación de metro 

Gracias y recomendada[QWERTY123]Angela was a great host! What a great location! easy to get there from the JFK airport and also easy to get to Manhattan -> subway is less than 5 mins. The apartment was clean all the time, we received new clean towels for our second week and we reached Angela quickly if we had any questions. She also took care of us that everything was ok.  We would recommend her place to stay.[QWERTY123]Angela was exactly what I wished in a host: someone who was easy to contact, but who was not overly present. That doesn't mean that she wasn't nice, however, as she really did all she could for us to be comfortable. My girlfriend and I stayed very little in the house and did not use the kitchen at any point, but all we had to use was clean and in order. We really appreciated our stay.[QWERTY123]Was confortable my estay there, the place was clean. Nice person as neighbors. The Deli store is in front of the apartment has cute tender from Puerto Rico great person. Thanks Angela[QWERTY123]Angela was a great host. She's very nice and helpful.
The place is very close to subway, restaurants and delis, super convenient. Great value![QWERTY123]Thank you Angela I have had a perfect time. The apartment was clean and quiet. Close to the subway and safe area. True pictures.[QWERTY123]Hi everyone! I spent one month at Angela's and to be honest it was great. She is always available and ready to help you in any matter. She is willing to make your stay really comfortable, every time I asked her for a favour she gave it to me. The room is big and very clean. The location is good, plenty of stores, bars,... and you have a train station really close that in 15min you can get Manhattan. I like the neighbourhood, people are friendly. Overall I would say you won't find anything better at this price. I would recommend Angela's place to everyone. If I come back to NYC I would like to stay at Angela's again 100%.[QWERTY123]This house is really close to the metro station and it just took about 4 minutes of walking. Angela is a great host as she will make sure the cleanness of the house because she want everybody has comfortable stay here.[QWERTY123]We very much enjoyed our 1 week stay in Brooklyn. The place was perfect for day trips around Brooklyn or to Manhattan. Subway station is very close. There are two Delis across the stress and numerous cafes, bars and stores only a stroll away.
We did not get to meet Angela but check-in and out worked fine and she was very quick in answering any questions. 
The apartment is rented out to several people so you share kitchen and bathroom with strangers, but being out the whole day, we didn't really run into each other much.
Make sure to bring earplugs, there is a trafficlight right infront of the house which makes traffic noisy.[QWERTY123]Ubytování splnilo naše očekávání. Oblast byla v dosahu centra města (cca  30 minut) - dobré spojení metrem i autobusy cca 5 minut od ubytování. Hostitelka nám umožnila ubytovat se večer a při zpáteční cestě ponechat zavazadla v bytě i po domluveném času odjezdu. Ubytování doporučujeme.[QWERTY123]Our stay with Angela was great. Located only a few blocks from the C-line that goes straight into Manhattan, close to a convenient grocery store, good WiFi, nice and tidy room, and Angela was very helpful (even though I mixed up the date and the address). I definitely recommend staying here![QWERTY123]Great place, good host[QWERTY123]The room is beautiful with a backyard. Angela is very nice. She comes clean the apartment as well as the room every week - you cannot get this with every Airbnb host. Great experience![QWERTY123]The host canceled this reservation 11 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.[QWERTY123]Todo encontrado como estaba descrito así que para nosotros genial.[QWERTY123]Flat is in a good location in Brooklyn near the subway and shops and very quiet at night. The kitchen and bathroom are shared and while we were there we had one lovely neighbour to share it with who was very easy. Angela was very helpful and accommodating and was always quickly available whenever we needed any kind of advice or help. We had a brilliant week.[QWERTY123]As always we had a good stay at Angela's!
The appartment is close to the C Line subway and many groceries around.
Angela is vert helpful and easy to communicate with.
I highly recommend.[QWERTY123]The room that I rented was lovely and very comfortable. The neighborhood was nice and the location was close to a subway station, grocery stores, and options for food. The host was also very hospitable - I would definitely come here again!"	40.683103153514466	-73.95473053225712	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/10452	3	70.0	0.8
77	23180	"Very nice place, very nice neighborhood, Tony was also very nice, it really couldn't have been better except maybe with a phone or an internet connection and some extra sets of keys.[QWERTY123]Great bed & shower! Great location near Myrtle & all the restaurants & stores. Tony was easy to deal with & get an email response.   Paula F.  April 2010[QWERTY123]Tony is fair, reliable and helpful person. His flat and  the building are clear, the street is nice. The stay was pleasant. A lot of thanks for Tony and for airbnb. Jozsef July 2010.[QWERTY123]Tony's apartment is great and in a great, quiet and friendly  location between Clinton Hill and Fort Greene. A lot of good bars and restaurants within walking distance. You can get to downtown brooklyn in ten minutes or to Manhattan in 25 minutes using public transportation.

The apartment was impeccably clean and spacious, and Tony has been very kind, supportive and flexible. I look forward to staying at his place again in the future!
[QWERTY123]Tony is very prompt and courteous.  He is an excellent host![QWERTY123]The apartment is very well kept, comfy and in a lively but peaceful residential neighborhood: plenty of shops, good restaurants, bars, very well served by the metro.
Tony was helpful, friendly and precise.
Loved the stay![QWERTY123]Tony is extremely communicative and accommodating with regards to our vacation rental. We were horribly delayed at the airport and he had someone waiting for us at his apartment when we got there. A real relief. It really helps when you're lugging around a lot of luggage! The apartment is clean and comfortable and in a very safe neighborhood. There is 24 hour security with numerous gates to pass through before you get to the apartment block which makes us feel very secure. All in all, a very pleasant experience dealing with Tony. Highly recommended for a stay in New York City.[QWERTY123]The apartment was nice and clean in a quiet apartment compound. Will rent from Tony when I'm in NYC.[QWERTY123]We stayed at Tony's over a couple of weekends as we were in and out of town. He was totally super about us coming in at weird timings (like 8.30 am) and communication with him was simple, straight-forward and direct, which we appreciate very much. Thanks, Tony![QWERTY123]Great apartment! Tony was flexible and helpful. Really enjoyed our stay. Might even check out that neighborhood to live in!

Thanks Tony![QWERTY123]Great Neighborhood, close to many good restaurants and accesible to the city .  

[QWERTY123]All is good, - the apartment address it is necessary to specify the unique remark precisely 5D... And so - Tony the Guy Good.

















 автозапчасти subaru[QWERTY123]Excellent Apartment, TOny was very helpful and very courteous, definently would stay here again![QWERTY123]the apartment was nice, clean and well located (less than 10 min walking from the closest subway station and in a quiet area). it accomodates comfortably 4 persons. only 1 remark: it is not possible to adjust the temperature of the heaters, so even in January it was extremely warm inside the apartment.. but it was not such a big deal, we just opened a bit the windows. Tony is friendly and helpful. I strongly recommend this accomodation![QWERTY123]Filthy furniture, lamps didn't work, extremely basic. Nice neighbourhood.[QWERTY123]As always it was pleasure staying here, Tony as always was a great host!! will be back soon : )[QWERTY123]We had a wonderful stay in New York. Brooklyn is a great place to live during the journey.
Tony's apartement was nice, the reception was perfect.
[QWERTY123]We had a wonderful stay in New York. Brooklyn is a great place to live during the journey. Tony's apartment was nice, in a quiet surrounding and 5 minute to the bus station. Security of the apartment was perfect. Reception might be better. Adress confirmation must be made before departure. I would recommend this apartment to the new visitors.[QWERTY123]Kinda of difficult to communicate with Tony,besides that everything was great![QWERTY123]My stay in Tony's place was wonderful. The apartment is located  in a great neighborhood and it's only a few blocks from the sub train. The apartment is  private and clean and the host Tony was great! I will love to stay in Tony's apartment again. I highly recommend him.[QWERTY123]Good neighborhood, place as shown on pct. Although it has bunch of electronic stuff nothing working...  :) was a good time in NYC...
thanks Tony![QWERTY123]Great apartment and great location. Tony was a friendly and flexible host. Thumbs up on my first Air BnB rental - will definitely consider this place again when I'm back visiting the area.[QWERTY123]We had a horrible stay, place is a junk-yard.[QWERTY123]My family, and I were very impressed with our host Tony, he was very helpful, accommodating, and professional. He went the extra mile to ensure our stay in Brooklyn for our son's wedding was enjoyable, and friendly. When we first arrived in Brooklyn, we arrived very early, there had been a plumbing issue concerning the previous tenants, and the apt. was not quite ready. Tony went out of his way to make sure we had a place to decompress, and unwind when we arrived, for that alone he has my highest recommendations. The apartment is a two bedroom on the fifth floor, and was very well suited to our needs, we met many very nice, and gracious people, and had an excellent experience. Keith.[QWERTY123]Great location, the apartment is confortable and quiet.   Definitely will contact Tony again on our next trip.[QWERTY123]appartamento basico ma comodo. Il letto è grande e molto confortevole, la doccia buona, anche se aveva un problema di scarico dell'acqua un po' lento. La cucina è sfornita di pentole, ci sono piatti e stoviglie, nel compelsso la pulizia potrebbe essere migliore. Comunque  l'appartamento è in un quartiere moltro carino, tranquillo e sicuro. La metropolitana line (Website hidden by Airbnb) minuti a piedi, ma non è diretta con Manhattan; la stazione metro che collega con Manhattan e ha diverse linee è a 15/20 minuti a piedi da casa. 
L'appartamento è da consigliare soprattutto per la zona in cui si trova, comunque siamo stati molto bene
Maria[QWERTY123]Good location - close enough to the subway and local restaraunts/cafes. Appartment only has the minimum working facilities. All came together in the end but Tony tried to complicate the booking process a bit.[QWERTY123]Wonderful location. A short bus ride to the train. Safe area with lots of restaurants and bars nearby. It was my first time on airbnb and i would deffinately stay at Tony's again!
Thanks 
J[QWERTY123]Decent size place for the price, easy to get to manhattan.[QWERTY123]très grand appartement, tout confort, salon, cuisinne, salle de bain et 2 chambres, nous étions donc très bien logé, moi et mes deux grands  enfants dans le début du quartier de brooklyn
c un endroit que l'on vous recommande
[QWERTY123]I had a great stay at Tony's. The apartment was clean, comfortable, and much bigger and nicer than I had originally expected judging from the pictures on the profile. The person that check us in was super nice and accommodating. The neighborhood around the apartment was cute, lots of friendly people and sweet little shops, cafes, and restaurants. My only source of alarm was the lease agreement (i think the lawyerly jargon scared me a bit) and the deposit that was requested after booking but it all ended up working out, I received my deposit in full upon check out. Over all I had a lovely time and I would strongly recommend this listing.[QWERTY123]deçu par la propreté[QWERTY123]Pasamos una excelente semana en NY en el apto de Tony, es amplio, cómodo, iluminado y con muy buena calefacción para el invierno!! La zona es tranquila y agradable y además en 20 minutos llegamos al centro de Manhattan...fue una muy buena experiencia. La recomendamos...

Montevideo[QWERTY123]Tony is amazing!  We arrived after the time we were suppose to and he still waited for us in the apartment.  The aparment is amazing.  Great location, 2 blocks away from the G train, deli store half a block down, a great Spanish/American restaurant also half block away (which we unfortuantely discovered the last 2 days of our stay)....food is delicious!  Heater was on and worked great.  Its' very spacious.  Definately worth the stay there!  If i travel back, I would definitely stay at his place again.  Thank sTony![QWERTY123]The location was perfect for me.  It is a very safe situation with security for the apartment complex. It would be best if the owner made some repairs to the apartment before renting it again.[QWERTY123]Nos hospedamos durante Semana Santa del 2012 mi suegra, mi esposa y yo.

El apartamento es muy amplio y el vecindario de Clinton Hills es lindísimo. A un par de cuadras hay todo tipo de restaurantes, farmacia, tiendas de abarrotes, todo.

Para ser nuestra primera experiencia con Airbnb Tony nos dejó una muy buena impresión. Es una persona simpática y honrada, un poco reservado al principio pero es como decimos en Costa Rica ""pura vida"". Su respuesta fue muy rapida cuando otros oferentes en Brooklyn ni siquiera se dignaron a contestar con un no.

El precio es conveniente y justo. El apartamento superseguro y amplio. Y una cosa muy importante: silencioso. Experiecias anteriores en Manhattan en hostels especialmente me tenían preocupado con respecto al particular descanso de mi suegra quien es es una persona adulta mayor, pero el apartamento de Tony fué perfecto. Las camas y el sofa son supercómodas. Tiene televisión satelital con varios canales en español.

Por cierto, con Tony se puede hablar español, lo cual da un valor agregado muy conveniente,[QWERTY123]Overall, it was pretty alright for the price. Neighborhood was great, cafes and shops everywhere. Apartment was old and many things were faulty but it's really what you get for the amount we paid. The apartment had security guards so it's pretty safe. It took about 25mins- 30mins to get to Manhattan.
Tony was a great guy and was open to feedback. He even help us save a lot of money on airport transfer on our way back.[QWERTY123]My parents had a lovely time staying at Tony's place in Clinton Hill.  The apartment is roomy and light and they loved having an elevator and security desk - rare for Brooklyn.  They would certainly consider staying there again.[QWERTY123]This was my first experience in airBandB and was really great. Our staying at Tony Torres´s place (5 nights-4 people)  was perfect:  nice, beautiful and quiet neighborhood (Clinton Hill, Brooklyn) well served by several subway stations, restaurants and grocery stores. The apartment is very comfortable. Downtown Brooklyn is located to wackable distance. 
Robert, who was the guy who help us is very kind and polite and the comunication with Tony was good. 
I would definitively recomend this place, reasonable price vs what you get. Five stars![QWERTY123]Great!
Thank u Tony!! :)[QWERTY123]Tony was responsive and accommodating. It was good to have the space of an appartment to ourselves at the price. The apartment is older and only in fair condition but the rooms are larger and all is functional. Easy walk to the subway and some stores for supplies and bank close by too. The neighborhood is nice - clean, trees in the streets, people out and about, and felt safe.[QWERTY123]We (family of 4 from Switzerland) had a pleasant stay in New York. The appartment is clean and cosy. The neighborhood is good, plenty of shops and restaurants nearby. Subway is 10 min to walk, bus to Brooklyn 2 min. Tony Torres is friendly and helpful.

We can recommend to stay in Brooklyn at Tony Torres appartment.[QWERTY123]Appartement  conforme à la description, grand, bien situé, propre mais un peu vieux, abîmé par le temps. Un petit relooking ne ferait pas de mal. Grand salon, grandes chambres. Manque le wi-fi, manque de lampes. Salle de bain sans aération, dommage. Quartier calme. Hôte gentil, honnête mais peut-être un peu difficile à comprendre si l'on ne parle pas couramment l'anglais. Mais très professionnel ![QWERTY123]If you are looking for a clean, convenient and inexpensive place in Brooklyn, Tony's apartment might meet your needs. My husband described it as a 'no frills' place for guys, or maybe a couple who is not looking for anything fancy.  Probably not big enough for a family.  Tony was very pleasant to deal with.

Pros:  Clean and quiet; 2 separate sleeping areas; elevator; apartment staff and residents very pleasant; nice neighborhood with restaurants and shopping; adequate bathroom with tub/shower combination; small kitchen with appliances.

Cons:  Linen supply lacked washcloths; for older people, it's a 15-20 minute walk to Subway; signing a lengthy contract (standard R/E rental form) with security and key deposit is required.  No problem getting our deposits returned upon checking out but be aware that this is a requirement for renting.[QWERTY123]Bonne adresse pour découvrir New-York. L'appartement est proche du métro. Il est climatisé (utile pour l'été) et bien entretenu. Le propriétaire est très correct. Il y a juste 100$ de caution pour les dommages éventuels et la perte des clés. Parfait pour quelques jours.[QWERTY123]Appartement conforme à l'annonce, spacieux, très bien situé dans Brooklyn à une dizaine de minutes de plusieurs métros.
Quartier tranquille, dans un immeuble sécurisé proche des commerces.
Propriétaire sympathique et très arrangeant malgré notre arrivée en avance.
Appartement correct et propre bien qu'un peu ancien.
Quelques aménagements (rideaux, lumières, ustensiles de cuisine) seraient nécessaires pour que ce soit pleinement satisfaisant.
En résumé, un bon rapport qualité-prix ![QWERTY123]Great location in Brooklyn, walking distance from the Metro into Manhattan and a 10 minute cab ride to Williamsburg/Bedford Avenue which was amazing fun.

Great place, so much room for 3 people we didn't know what to do with ourselves and good value for money.[QWERTY123]Tony was perfect! House is quite close to the metro and in a quiet area.
He was helpful and kind.
L 'apartment is as described and is very spacious and comfortable for 4 persons and more!
really a great price for the service!
I will certainly go back to tony next time![QWERTY123]Tony's 2-bed in Brooklyn is basic but clean, quiet, convenient. It felt safe and was exactly what we (2 guys visiting NYC for the first time) needed. For the price it's a bargain to be honest! 

It's no frills, but who cares?! It's cheap, cheerful, warm and comfortable and we spent very little time in it to be honest! Tony is great too, very reliable and was flexible with us when our flight was late too. A safe bet all round! Try Putnams bar across the road for a good local drink too - very friendly, great place![QWERTY123]Clean and Secure, great location. Probably should have tried to get a place with internet (being unfamiliar with the area) but the muffin place down the street has free wifi so just head down there for morning coffee and day planning. Tony was friendly and patient with us and good with meeting times.[QWERTY123]The house was great. It was more then enough space for the 3 of us. We found it convenient and well located to nearby bars and restaurants. It was a 15 min walk to the subway which takes you to Manhattan.

Tony was helpful and flexible. 

Make sure you check out the Brooklyn flea markets on the weekend![QWERTY123]Big appartment. Buses and subway not far from it.
And very accommodating host.[QWERTY123]Great spacious apartment close to train lines, close to shops and in a nice quiet suburb in Brooklyn. Easy to get around and to manhattan[QWERTY123]The reservation was canceled 7 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.[QWERTY123]Tony has been accommodating to our requests during the stay of my parents. He was responsive to emails. The apartment was clean, comfortable, and had any things we needed. The neighborhood is very nice, and safe. There are different stores around. The one thing about the apartment is that there is no internet, but there is a cafe on the corner of the street which has WiFi."	40.69257404843931	-73.96876959612378	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/23180	4	125.0	0.775
78	23501	"I really enjoyed my stay in NYC, and staying at Marieka's was a big reason why. Her place is great, she made me feel very welcome, the room and bed are great, and its in a nice neighbourhood which is only a quick trip away from downtown.
I highly recommend Marieka's place[QWERTY123]I really enjoyed my stay at NYC, thanks to Mareika's clean, safe and secure apartment. She is a great host and helped me in so many ways to make sure that I am comfortable in a new place. She also helped me stay a little longer than I had booked for because of a change in flight schedule for no extra charge! If you are thinking about staying at her apartment and hoping for a comfortable, safe, clean and secure place, You got it!!!,  besides having her as a great host![QWERTY123]We spend really happy moments in Marieka's house. 
She is really hospitable and kind and she gives us useful indications (Fat cat :))))
The house is beautiful, there is everything you need. 
The district is very nice and in 20 minutes by metro you can easily reach the city center; the metro station is very near home. 

Thank you Marieka for everything. 

Giulia & Sofia[QWERTY123]We really enjoyed our stay with Marieka. As Michael stated, the bedroom is very nice and you have immediate access to downtown. Marieka was very helpful in orientating us to the neighborhood as well as pointing out some of the local parks to check out. We highly recommend staying with Marieka![QWERTY123]We were glad we found Marieka's place in New York and were very satisfied with our stay there.  The bedroom is very nice, everything is clean and tidy and you'll feel at home. Marieka is a great host and my wife and I would definite come back to her place or recommend it to our friends.[QWERTY123]We had a very pleasant stay at Marieka's place.  It is in a great location with easy access to the whole city from the 168th St station.  The room is cozy with a very comfortable bed. The only downside was that the neighborhood was a bit noisy at night, hence the 4 stars.  Otherwise, we highly recommend staying there.[QWERTY123]Lo bueno: vas a encontrar un cuarto limpio, amplio y una cama muy comoda. La ducha del baño es refrescante.
Lo regular: No compartirás tiempo con tu anfitriona, bien sea por su agenda o por su disposición.
Lo malo: estarás en un vecindario latino, con esa atmósfera característica: un tanto de ruido, un poco de desorden y con esa atmósfera de cierta tensión y una leve sensacion de inseguridad.

Buena suerte.[QWERTY123]Marieka is a best host, and there is a best location to study city! Subway is about 10 minutes from apartments. Everything is clean and your bedroom is really cool to sleep. I love it and highly recommend to other travelers.

Мне очень понравилось жить у Марейки, квартира 3х комнатная, гостевая комната и ее находится в разных частях, поэтому ничто не мешает ложиться спать когда хочешь (кровать удобная и большущая). На улице бывает шумновато вечером. Метро в 10 минутах ходьбы, на станции соединяется несколько веток. Есть поблизости несколько продуктовых магазинов. В общем мне все понравилось, рекомендую =)[QWERTY123]Great location, close to 168th st station which leaves you anywhere in Manhattan within 20 minutes. Marieka was our amazing hostess who found time from her busy work schedule to explain anything we needed to know. She was even nice enough to allow us to leave one of our large bags in her house while we went on a trip to Washington DC. The room and whole house including kitchen are clean and tidy, exactly as on the photos. There was some noise from the street, especially during the weekend. 

All in all we can definitely recommend her place. 

Thank you Marieka from Carla and Daniel[QWERTY123]Marieka is very gracious sweet  host :)  , her place is safe clean and cozy, I really enjoyed my stay ,and location is close everything you may want to visit in NY city Manhattan , I would definitely stay here again , and I highly recommend Marieka's  place  to anyone visiting NY,[QWERTY123]If you want to feel at home, this is choice. Marieka is a very good host and she has all that you can need. The house is nice and your room is great. Live with Marieka is so easy because she´s a good roommate.
  I like the neighborhood, there are people in the streets always, you´ll never feel alone walking by the streets(at weekends could have some noise but you sleep ok?)And I like the neighbors too, they are so kind with the people
  You can believe me, this is a good choice whether travelling alone or in pairs. Enjoy it![QWERTY123]I had a very comfortable and pleasant stay at Marieka's place.The apartment offered everything you would require and Marieka is a very friendly and inviting host and made me feel very welcome in a homely environment. The subway station is very close-by and from there you can reach all the main attractions of New York. I would definitely recommend staying here as the room is very nice and the whole apartment is clean and cosy. Thanks again Marieka : )[QWERTY123]Marieka is a awesome person,and the place its really really good, definitely I recommend it the for any new visitor of NY[QWERTY123]Was my first time with airbnb. I enjoyed it a lot! Really a very nice decorated room and I wish I had known that place before ;) I can definitely recommend to stay there![QWERTY123]Marieka was a great host and I really felt like home when I was staying there![QWERTY123]The apartment is VERY VERY tidy and clean. I love love love her bed sheets..they are so soft and comfy... Everything as seen in pictures. The only thing is, the stairway is kinda narrow, so dont bring anything big/heavy. If you travel light, this is the perfect place for you. Marieka, sorry for leaving the nachos in your fridge..=P[QWERTY123]I wish I had read a more realistic review before booking so I hope mine helps the next person.

The apartment is nice and made up for all the other factors.

The apartment is situated in a heavily Dominican Latin area I think it's important to know that so your not expecting typical New York city people. The area is VERY noisy and you have people still blasting music at like 4am. I lost a lot of sleep and woke up randomly due to noise. The room is situated right near the road so you hear everything. Bring Ear Plugs. Also don't show any valuables (ipod, phone) whilst walking to the subway there are alot of weirdos lurking about. 
  
The apartment is located very close to the subway which will take you straight to the city in 20-30 minutes! which is great but you can find somewhere alot closer and safer for a the same price..don't underestimate how far away it is! 

For the price you'd pay I'd recommend you try Brooklyn or somewhere closer it is closer to the city and has more English speaking people and feels safer and nicer when I visited Brooklyn I regretted not booking there.


Unfortunately there is no denying Washington Heights where this is located is one of the worst parts of Manhattan and so far away from the New York City you see on television.[QWERTY123]Great and comfy place. A good alternative to spending $150 for some random hotel room. The area may at first glance seem to be not safe, but the people are actually really nice. Also it was super close to the subway, so that was convenient.[QWERTY123]My stay with Marieka was just fantastic!  she was a great host with a great apartment.  nice, fresh and clean throughout and the room was big with plenty space for your bags and what not.  Although the apartment is up on 164th she is only a couple blocks from the subway and a 15 minute journey to the center of downtown.  overall great stay and highly recommended.  thanks Marieka!![QWERTY123]we have a wonderul stayed at marieka's place, very neat, clean & near the subway, will definately stay there again[QWERTY123]I had an absolutely wonderful experience staying at the Monkey Retreat Manhattan! The apartment was clean and well maintained. My room was spacious with lots of natural light and a very comfortable bed. Marieka was an excellent host. She was very friendly and helpful. She provided me with all the information that I needed from getting to and from the airport to recommendation for fun things to do in Manhattan. I would definitely stay here again the next time I am in New York.[QWERTY123]Having stayed in other parts of Manhatten, I enjoyed my time at Marieka's Monkey Retreat the best.  I have stayed in some of the well known hotels, paid four times the price, and had a room smaller than Marieka's.  Not liking the constant noise of the big city and the swarms of people swirling around, I found Marieka's to be on a quite (by New York standards) side street.  The Monkey Retreat is close to the subway, part way between the people center and the historic Manhatten.  Marieka was a wonderful hostess and guided me to parts of Manhatten that I didn't know existed:  Fort Lee, Fort Tryon Park, The Cloisters, the Palisades, and a beautiful park only blocks from her apartment (and of course Central Park).  Without her guidance I would never have found out about the real New York City.

At first, not being used to that part of the ""Big City"", I was concerned about the location because some of the streets that I had been on in previous visits I did not feel safe on.  Most nights on this trip I returned to Marieka's between midnight and 3am...not once did I see anyone or anything that concerned me.  The walk to the subway is well lit and the people that I met in the neighborhood were friendly and helpful.

I am looking forward to my next trip to New York and I hope I will be able to stay at Marieka's again.  

[QWERTY123]Marieka was an excellent host who made her apartment feel like a second home during our stay. Upon arrival, we were given a tour of the apartment, where everything was located, where we'd be able to find things we needed, and then the keys. We were also encouraged and given access to use anything in her well-equipped kitchen, which felt much more homely than eating out all of the time (as it was also a good way to save money!) The room was equipped with everything you'd find in a hotel, except it was all for about 1/3 of the price, and much more cozy. One thing I noticed was a subway map in the room, which was a nice gesture on Marieka's part, considering guests would want to know how to move around in NYC. The room was clean and comfortable, with two windows that provided fresh air and light into the room. Also, the apartment is located near various subway stations, and places to eat, which made travel and recreation easy (about a 10-15 minute ride on the subway to arrive at Times Square, or other hot spots in the city.) Marieka was also very easy to contact whenever we had a question about the apartment when she was out, and she was friendly and willing to help us with any questions we had. She also respected our privacy, was non-intrusive, and very laid back! Thanks Marieka! Very much enjoyed the stay.[QWERTY123]I couldn't have been happier with Marieka. She was SO wonderful. I got in and on my first night there, she and I went out to a lovely dinner. She felt like a friend right away. She knows a lot about the city and is very happy to answer any questions you have. 
I read a couple reviews where people voiced concerns about the location, but it is NOT a big deal. So easy to get downtown or to the more frequented areas. 
It is a safe area and close to the subway and her room is super comfy and clean. 
All in all, I give it a 10 out of 10 and the best part is, that now I have a new friend![QWERTY123]Marieka was a great host! The next time I visit New York I will definitely be staying with her. When I arrived Marieka made sure to inform me of the intricacies of the New York MTA, as well as some other tid bits of information that I should know (including areas that I would be interested in checking out based on the type of person I was). The room was pretty simple, which suited me just fine. There were two decent sized windows that brought in a nice amount of sunlight. And the bed.....oh my word.....that bed was probably one of the most comfortable I have ever slept on. Even though the heater would occasionally make noise it really didn't disturb me because the bed was just so damn comfortable![QWERTY123]Marieka is the perfect land-lady!
She is so respectful, kind, willing to help and sweet!
Her home is so tidy, clean and cosy! You really feel at home.
Even if you're sharing the bathroom and the hole appartement, your intimacy is respected a 100%.
Great location!
So do not hesitate, If I come back to NYC I won't!
Thank you Marieka, we had a wonderful time at yours![QWERTY123]My boyfriend and I had a great stay at Monkey Retreat Manhattan, Marieka is a very sweet and  thoughtful person, She made us feel at home right away, We share some nice conversations and we would definitely stay at her place again when go back to NYC - THANKS again Marieka and hope to see you in Vancouver this summer! :)[QWERTY123]It was a great pleasure to stay at Monkey Retreat Manhattan. I felt really nice the moment I arrived at the place, the room is very clean, airy and SPECIOUS. This place is very near to the 168th st subway and has got many food options / deli shops near by.  All in all a great homestay option to Manhattan / NY and Marieka is  a  perfect host in the BIG APPLE city.
You can't ask for more, I guess...[QWERTY123]The apartment is super nice (very stylish and clean), in a safe looking neighborhood, 2 minutes from a subway station (it's quite far away from downtown, though). The room itself is big and gives you quite a lot of privacy (it has very good access to the kitchen and the bathroom). 

However, I found it a little hard to communicate with Marieka: she was hard to reach on the phone to arrange things like checking out and a bit passive agressive in written communication. These were minor issues though, and we enjoyed our stay.[QWERTY123]I stayed at Monkey Retreat Manhattan for 4 nights. It was really a nice place to live, Marieka made it very cute with many details. Room was clean and had everything I needed. Marieka was a great host, she was kind and warm, and gave me enough private as well. That was a perfect experience of staying there.[QWERTY123]Great host! The room is clean & quite.[QWERTY123]Staying with Marieka was pleasant and convenient. Her place is a short walk to the subway, and from there you can get wherever you want to go quickly and without any hassle or traffic; the trip to Times Square for instance takes no more than half an hour, and the tracks run all night. There is also a grocery store nearby and plenty of restaurants and street vendors.
 
Marieka is very welcoming and friendly, and as a resident New Yorker is happy to provide you with any advice you might need concerning good restaurants and attractions or travel routes. The room is equiped with a large map of the city that includes the subway lines, and this can be convenient even if you've brought your own map simply because of its size and detail. Her apartment is very clean and the room is large enough for all your luggage, with a closet big enough for all your clothes and shoes.
 
If you want to save money on meals she has a full compliment of kitchen ware that was more than ample for our uses. Overall, the experience was seamless and happy.

My only minor complaint is that I happened to twist my ankle 2 days before we were due in NY and Marieka only offered to give us a minor discount on a second booking and no refund on the first (as she has chosen a 'strict' refund policy).  In the end it worked out, as my ankle wasn't too badly injured, so I didn't rebook.  

I did, however, appreciate the use of a hairdryer and she made many other toiletries available to us.

Thanks for the great stay![QWERTY123]Marieka is a very accommodating host and the apartment is very neat and clean. She went out of her way to make sure I had everything I needed to make my stay comfortable.[QWERTY123]This room is a perfect option for people who are dissatisfied with prices of hotels in Downtown Manhattan! Even if 168th street isnt that close to the most touristically visited places in NYC, you can easily get to them by subway in max 30 minutes. Subway station is 10 minutes on feet from the block and as the apartment is located near Broadway, where you may find almost every type of shop (including fast foods), you wont get lost looking for what you need.

The room was clean and the apartment was interestingly furnished, what I found attractive when comparing to ordinary hotel rooms interior. The host also prepared clean towels and basic cosmetics and hygiene stuff.

I found only one disadvantage of the room - as its windows are to the street, it may be a lil' noisy in the evenings. However, I was able to fall asleep easily, therefore this wasn't a problem for me.

I'd recommend staying at Marieka's place and would definitely choose this for my next stay in New York.[QWERTY123]Just as described by others and Marieka as well. we were sopposed to come as a couple but only my BF came after a ""nice"" experience at the airport. We wanted to thank Marieka for waiting as my BF had a very late arrival. He enjoyed his stay very much and would definetelly come back again :)
Thank you
R&Z[QWERTY123]The room is great--clean, comfortable; the apartment is also great.  Marieka was super friendly and helpful, but also did not over-interfere like some ppl tend to do when running a bnb. I couldn't have asked for a better experience.[QWERTY123]Marieka was very accommodating and friendly. I had a great stay, and would recommend staying with her to anyone.[QWERTY123]Marieka was a wonderful host, very kind and helpful, and nice to talk to. The room and apartment are just lovely. Everything is so clean and cute. She pays a lot of attention to detail and everything is taken care of. The location is convenient as well! 
Definitely going back![QWERTY123]I had a wonderful stay at Marieka's retreat - which really deserves that name. It is a place to feel safe and at home. It was perfect to come here after a long day downtown to relax, have a snack and a good night's sleep. The bed was super comfortable, towels and sheets were provided, the kitchen fully equipped and everything was very clean.
Marieka was easy-going and a very helpful and friendly host, answering all my questions and giving good advice.

The apartment is really close to the A express train that takes you downtown in no time.

I definitely recommend this place and would go back there any time.

[QWERTY123]This was my first experience with Airbnb and I was very satisfied. 

The location of the apartment was excellent (I have no problem getting around New York; for people who are strongly opposed to taking the subway and don't feel like taking taxis to and from midtown all the time, this might not be ideal). 

Everything inside was as described (photos are accurate). It's a really great New York apartment - not big, but very comfortable and well furnished and there was no problem with lack of space.

Marieka was an excellent hostess. She made herself available to answer any questions that I had, offered suggestions about the neighborhood and the city at large, was pleasant and friendly, courteous and unobtrusive. She offered to wash some of my laundry when she was doing her own. When I checked in, her previous guests hadn't actually returned their keys to the apartment yet, and she actually gave me her own keys (!). 

I would definitely stay here again and I'd recommend that others do the same.[QWERTY123]My 6 night stay here was very comfortable, and Marieka was the perfect host.  Highly recommended![QWERTY123]This was my first time using Airbnb and I gotta say I was scared as hell. But after staying at Marieka's Monkey Retreat I am sold on this site. The place is exactly as described and pictured. It's very corky and I loved it. Marieka is a lover of the arts so there was jazz playing, paintings and one of a kind knick knacks everywhere, great conversations, and we had a lot in common. The place was super clean, kitchen was spotless, and I'm really scared of using people's bathrooms but this bathroom was perfect. If you're looking for a dope place to stay this is the spot. I wanted to come back at the end of the month, but the place is so great that she's pretty much booked all the time, it was just my luck I got the 2 nights. I will definitely be back once i can find an open date. :-)[QWERTY123]Marieka is AWESOME! 'nuff said.

Well, not quite(In reference to the 'nuff said part.), I don't like leaving things that vague. Marieka is a sweetheart!. Very friendly, welcoming and as helpful as any host could/should be. The place is very clean and I really enjoyed her entire apartment set up. Turns out her and I had a lot of things in common and we would have long dissuasions about anything and everything. 

If and when I return to NYC, I will say that there is a 98.27% that I will be staying with Marieka again. The other 1.73% depends on whether or not my budget will allow me to do so. But if I do, I hope I don't loose my keys again!. (Yes Marieka, you laugh it up.)[QWERTY123]Hemos estado cómodos en la habitación, estaba limpia y era tal cual aparece en la foto. Merieka ha sido correcta y educada con nosotros, en general la ´valoración es buena.[QWERTY123]The apartment and host were great! Marieka was attentive to making sure I had everything I needed, including information of how to get places, and where to eat. She recommended a restaurant up in Ft Tryon Park that was incredible. The apartment was very clean, comfortable and quiet for NY even if it is on the street side. I was able to get to my tourist destinations in under 30 minutes. I will definitely be staying with Marieka on my next visit to the city! Thank you again![QWERTY123]Once again Marieka gave me a tour of New York City that I would never be able to find on my own.  This was at least my 5th stay with Marieka and I wouldn't want to stay anywhere else.[QWERTY123]The apartment was clean and nice ,its about 2 minutes from the subway station and about 35 minutes to the time square. The room looked exactly like on the picture,we got all we need,Marieka was also nice,thanks a lot! :)[QWERTY123]This was my first Airbnb experience and it was a great one! The apartment felt very homy right away. The room is exactly as shown in the pictures and Marieka keeps the whole place very nice and clean. You can tell that she likes to host peopla and does so a lot. She even keeps toiletries others have left for her guests in case they run out of toothpaste like me :) If you get on the 
express train it takes about 20 mins to get to Times Square, which is great. The subway is just 2 blocks away and I felt safe in the neighborhood at all times! Marieka and I got along great and had some very fun and long nights! I'd definitely stay with her again! I had been in the city several times before but this was by far my best NYC experience. Thanks Marieka![QWERTY123]well connected, nice apartment, good choice.[QWERTY123]Marieka has a beautiful room available with a good bed, warmth, and light. It is on the second floor of a walk up, easy to come and go, and excellent location, very near the A train which is also a stop on the 1 train. Her place is clean, organized, and calm, and is ""shoeless,"" so the floors are clean enough to walk around in socks and bare feet. Marieka herself is self possessed, knowledgeable about the city, and terrifically helpful - we took her up on her recommendations for dinner, breakfast, and a place to hear jazz, all great. We'd stay there again.[QWERTY123]I knew I will love Marieka for  the first day I met her. She just awesome girl. She is kind, beautiful, friendly, respectful and wonderful. I don't know how to use exactly words to describe her that put in my mind. She just awesome. She made me love New York even more. She is greatest host and greatest friend. I was so lucky to have her as my host. Really., I was very fortune to have her as my host. She made everything easy and possible. Especially, her friendly attitude that made me just like relax at home or even better. She is awesome.  I use my life to guarantee if you have her as your host then you are a luckiest guest ever. Love you Marieka.......Take good care and miss you already....
Eliza[QWERTY123]I was in town for a show that I was performing in and I needed a quiet place to stay while I was finishing off rehearsals and the performance. Marieka's apartment was a great choice, as it was pleasant, quiet and clean. She is very nice and friendly, and makes you feel immediately comfortable.[QWERTY123]This felt like a home away from home, and Marieka is a professional who is able to be business-like and very warm host. I appreciated her efforts to make sure I was oriented with the area for the weekend, and with also preparing me ahead of time with parking details, etc. She's a gem of a person. Thanks for a great stay![QWERTY123]Marieka was a wonderful hostess! The room is large, very clean and very pretty, and it is easy to find from the subway stop, which can be reached quickly from downtown via the express A train.  Everything about this apartment was charming:  it was clean, cozy, lovingly decorated, and impeccably kept. The bed is really comfortable, I slept so well! 

It was also great to meet Marieka, who was filled with excellent advice about getting to know New York and all the different places one can explore. She has tons of great stories about her experience living there and you can tell that she really loves the city.  She was most welcoming and kind, any airbnb guest would be lucky to have her as a hostess. 

I highly recommend this apartment to anyone who wants to see New York and meet a great New Yorker!



[QWERTY123]Marieka's home is just as I would expect for a young, artistic woman living in NYC to be.  It is quite comfortable and filled with the things she loves.  Marieka is a lovely hostess and we enjoyed our stay.  The only drawback was the distance to mid-town.  However, the subway station is nearby, very easy to find and the ride into mid-town is about 30 minutes.  The huge Columbia Medical center, markets and restaurants are on the main street very near this apartment. I recommend this apartment for anyone wanting to find a comfortable, affordable place to stay while visiting the NYC area.[QWERTY123]Maka was a lovely host, very welcoming and helpful with tips on where and when to go to places. Her place is a great location and beautiful.[QWERTY123]This was our first time using airbnb and we thought the overall experience was very good. Everything went smoothly and there were no surprises. Monkey Retreat was a good choice for our needs, budget and location. Our room was large with good natural light. We had a roomy closet and the bed was exceptionally comfortable. Thank you, Meka![QWERTY123]Good place to stay, clean, near to subway and safety. I recommend.[QWERTY123]Meka was an amazing host.  Helped us out in our last minute time of need.  I'd highly recommend staying at the Monkey Retreat. She has everything you'll need from towels and toiletries to cookies on the nightstand to great conversation.  Looking forward to going back.[QWERTY123]The room is clean and nice. Very private, lots of natural light, very comfortable bed and pillows and comes with a roomy wardrobe. The place is very close to the subway too. We also loved the neighbourhood - safe, interesting, and we had really good breakfast at George's Coffee, half a minute from Meka's apartment, every other day. Meka is also a helpful host - very familiar with Manhattan. However, do be mindful about the check-in time. We were late as we got stuck at the JFK customs for 2 hours (we landed at 2.20pm and got out of the airport only at 4.30pm) and reached the place way after the check-in time. I'd suggest to international travelers coming from JFK to set at least a 3.5 hour time budget to clear customs and travel to Meka's place (rush hour traffic in manhattan is crazy too). Meka works a different schedule every day so it is important to let her know your check-in time so she can be home then.[QWERTY123]My stay at Monkey Retreat Manhattan was wonderful!   The bedroom was large and airy (actually seems bigger than the picture shown on airbnb), and the bed was very comfortable.  The whole apartment was nice and clean.  An especially nice touch were the fluffy ""monkey"" towels.  

Meka was lovely and very informative.  She knows all the best places to eat.  The wine bar she recommended was fantastic.  I felt right at home and would definitely stay at Monkey Retreat Manhattan again.[QWERTY123]Meka's place was fantastic and quite accurate to the photos. Meka was very hospitable and it was great that she also provided cereal in the morning!  The only reason it didn't get the 5th star was because the weather during our stay was very hot and the apartment doesn't have A/C or great air-flow.  The room does have a good ceiling fan though.  Overall a great experience.[QWERTY123]Once again I enjoyed my stay at Meka's Monkey Retreat, lots of memories.  I will be staying in New York again this week, but due to late plans, the Monkey Retreat was already booked.  Although I was not able to book with Meka, she referred me to friends that also book thru Airbnb and I was able to get a room.  Thanks again for your hospitality and your help.[QWERTY123]I had a lovely time at the Monkey Retreat!  Great host, very clean environment, close to express subway.  Even without air conditioning it was ver comfortable because Meka makes sure that you have plenty of fans!  Will stay there again if available.[QWERTY123]My stay with Meka was nothing short of fantastic and so warm and comfortable... I came into town looking for a place to stay whilst I looked for something more permanent and I what got was so much more as after two days I feel I have gained an incredible friend. Meka was so generous in opening up her home the pictures 100% reflect what the apartment looks like but they can in Norway give you any idea about the amazing atmosphere that Meka has created... Meka is so generous with her knowledge of the city and I would definiately stay with her again if given the opputunity[QWERTY123]Meka is a very pleasant and uncomplicated girl, so you can ask her everything if you need help. To say it in her words: ""Make yourself a home!""[QWERTY123]Hi
Meka is a very friendly and fast responding person. The room is exactly looking like on the the pictures. It is very clean and the flat is very nice.  I could sleep very well in her home and everything was well prepared, when I arrived.
So her room is a very good tip to stay.[QWERTY123]The apartment has a great location, near the metro. Very comfortable too. The neighborhood is very quiet. Meka gave several tips about the city. I liked very much."	40.83927035347513	-73.94281334635886	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/23501	2	65.0	0.64
79	10962	"We stayed at Laurie's place for one night in september, and that really was much too short. We really liked the hostess, her amazing house and the neighbourhood. Brooklyn has a lot to offer, and so has Laurie. Won't forget her waffles! Next time we will stay longer![QWERTY123]Great place in Brooklyn and close to NYC by sub. (no risk at all).

Correct room, good and quick breakfast! 

Merci Laurie pour votre accueil chaleureux. 

Et entrainez vous pour une partie de Tennis WII avec Peter sut le central parisien.[QWERTY123]Four star. What a wonderful hostess she is. Very knowledgable about Brooklyn and especially where the good food is. The house is comfortable, attractive, quiet, with great beds and an excellent shower. I only did morning coffee, but there was fruit, cereal, breads, fresh orange juice if I wanted. Laurie and Peter, her son are the best.[QWERTY123]Well.....here's the thing....

To begin with, New York is the greatest city in the US. Period. Second....Brooklyn is the biggest little hamlet of niceness that exists in New York City. From Wms burg back to Park Slope....great.music...GREAT FOOD, and yet quiet on the street.....this is life as it should be. Now couple that with Laurie's expert tips on the neighbourhoods and her son's (Website hidden by Airbnb) cannot be beat! We just finished our holiday and still ...we want to be right back. Laurie and Peter's  place is everything and then some. And they has good tea with breakfast too!!!

Eric and Stacey
[QWERTY123]When you stay at Laurie’s place in Brooklyn’s Park Slope, you end each day of New York fun and exploration by going ‘home’.  It’s warm and welcoming, clean and comfortable, filled with lively art, loads of sun, and is home to 2 beautiful big-eyed cats. This large home is on a quiet street so you aren’t kept awake by street noise, traffic, and lights. Still, it’s close to the action. There are restaurants galore and quick and easy access to Manhattan and other NY areas via all major subway lines. Laurie and Peter are able and eager to advise you on the many attractions and activities in the area and across the city, and the best travel options, to and from.  I’m so glad I found this wonderful and affordable accommodation in New  York where hotels are famously impersonal and over-priced. I’ll be back, for sure. Thanks Laurie and Peter![QWERTY123]To experience the real New York, stay in Brooklyn with Laurie.  Her comfortable, quiet home is full of art, books and music and Laurie is a terrific ambassador for her neighborhood.  Manhattan is a short (15 min.max) ride away on the subway, and there is a ton of great activities right in Brooklyn including the outstanding Brooklyn Museum, Botanical Gardens and many little character bars and restaurants right around the corner from Laurie's place.  Stay here, you'll love it.  Highly recommended.[QWERTY123]Laurie's home was a wonderful respite for us after long fun-filled NYC days. Traveling via subway just a few short blocks from her house got us everywhere we wanted to be with ease. We saw 6 shows in 5 nights and never had any trouble coming home late. The room was spacious and very clean and located on the top floor away from the living areas. There is a private bath and plenty of privacy. Laurie was so welcoming that we quickly felt as if we were visiting a friend. I would highly recommend her rooms to anyone.[QWERTY123]Fabulous!  My family had a great time in New York thanks to Laurie and her wonderful home.  They felt welcome and the fact that she shared all the neighborhood treasures with them was priceless.  The next time we go to New York - we're staying with Laurie!  Thanks Laurie!!  
Peirce, Eli and Sylvie from Santa Fe, NM[QWERTY123]My friend and I had a wonderful week at Laurie's. It's a beautiful house and it really looked like the pictures on here! Laurie's a very friendly and laid back host with lots of good tips and information and materials to look through. Happy with the room, too - this was located next to a lovely bathroom. And the neighbourhood is very nice, too - great brownstone houses and nice coffee places, restaurants and shops, all nearby. As well as Prospect Park - we were lucky to be there for the free Sharon Jones concert. But again - without Laurie we probably wouldn't have known that this was on! Nice fruit salad, croissants and coffee in the morning, Internet access no problem and good chats with Laurie. It was our first time in NY and it was so much nicer to stay privately than in a cheap and nasty hotel room. I can highly recommend staying in Brooklyn and especially with Laurie. (Didn't meet Peter who was in summer camp, but one of the cats was there - super cute!)[QWERTY123]Laurie has been a perfect host, we spent marvellous days in New York City also thanks to her suggestions and help. The house was so nice and the atmosphere so friendly that we are looking forward to he there again! Thanks a lot!!![QWERTY123]We had a wonderful stay at Laurie's beautiful home in Park Slope, Brooklyn. The beds were very comfortable and we were able to have a washroom and washer/dryer right next door to our room which was very convenient. We would recommend bringing small luggage as the room was on the top floor of a 3 story walkup and the stairwells/hallways are very narrow, navigating that was a bit of a challenge, but that is minor. The subway station was quite close, and it was an easy commute into Manhattan, getting to the upper parts of Manhattan took awhile, but its nice to sit and relax on the air conditioned train after a long, hot day of sightseeing. Laurie was super friendly and helpful, and had many suggestions for things to do and places to see during our stay, it was really nice to have the advice from a local who knows her city! Our only complaint would be having to watch out for the escape artist kitty every time we came back to or left the house, there are two sets of doors at the entrance, but the space between them is very small, and we had to enter and shut the doors one at a time, while trying to keep the kitty away. It was very frustrating and time consuming, and if someone else left the inner door open, it was very hard to keep him from escaping, he got out twice during our visit :(

All in all, it was a very pleasant visit, thanks again for your hospitality Laurie![QWERTY123]The house is in a great location in Brooklyn - very close to Manhattan via the subway.  The rooms were lovely, quiet and clean - very comfortable beds!  Laurie was such a lovely host, she went out of her way to help us with directions and in deciding what to do out of all the choice there is in NYC!  She even found a bed for us early on the first morning when we arrived after a 32 hour trip! (thanks Peter - love your comic/ book collection). The 2 cats are sweet, as were the squirrels running along the phone lines outside.  And despite Lauries claims that it wasn't at its best, the garden was just gorgeous.
Thanks Laurie!!PS still remember that gluten free bread - was amazing![QWERTY123]Laurie 
-gave lots of info re where to eat, how to find out about cheap tickets, how to get around etc
-gave us free rein of her pc for internet browsing
-showed us how to use her great coffee machine
-had a lovely room with great bedding 
-was fascinating to talk with
-lives in a lovely house in a pretty street
[QWERTY123]What else can I add to the many reviews by others? I would only say: ""Home away from home"",Laurie is someone you can fully trust ( and she trusts you) a great host , a great house, a great neighborhood, a great great Prospect park, great public transports etc etc.[QWERTY123]Laurie is a fabulous, knowledgable host.  She is right there for you to suggest wonderful opportunities to explore Brooklyn and beyond but recedes into her busy life to let you be on your own.  The house is quiet and the neighborhood is amazing.  Lots of places to eat, bistros and the like, and Laurie will steer you in the right direction.  There is wonderful opportunity to meet interesting people that are also staying at Laurie's - I do not think I could have had a better experience or a more affordable opportunity to get the best out of my stay in Brooklyn.  And, if you are a cat lover - Batman and Robin will make the most out of your affection and open door.[QWERTY123]Highly recommend. Location was great. (Park Slope and Brooklyn are wonderful, subway was a few blocks away.) Clean house, comfortable beds, clean bathrooms. Sharing a bathroom with only one other bedroom meant very little/no waiting. Laurie was friendly and helpful. Good breakfast foods on-hand and she gave my husband a great Red Hook breakfast reco. Lots of local guidebooks and maps too, in case you like to digest stuff that way. Already thinking about when we can go back.[QWERTY123]Staying with Laurie was my first experience with AirBnB, and she was an absolutely wonderful host. Her house was lovely, very quiet, and perfectly located. I will definitely be staying with her again if I am ever in New York![QWERTY123]Our days with Laurie was excellent!

Her house is quite confortable, the room reserved for us was wide enough and spotlessly clean.
Laurie is an excellent person, friendly and a very good tourist guide. She gave us very good tips about Manhathan e Brooklyn. This is an excellent point to stay with her.

The location is excellent too, are just two blocks from Lines D, N, R, F and G subway, with easy access to any part of NY. All types of stores can also be found nearby.

Five stars for our new friend Laurie.[QWERTY123]Laurie was an excellent host. She knew the neighborhood extremely well and was happy to offer advice on uncrowded cafes for me to work from, as well as restaurants, music halls, and other attractions. The room was comfortable and the house had lots of character--this was my first time using airbnb, and the whole experience felt a lot more authentic than the chain hotels I usually stay at. I'd definitely like to stay here again if I'm in the area.
[QWERTY123]Great visit. It was our second time. No problems at all. Laurie is helpful and the location can't be beat. Wonderful chocolate croissants![QWERTY123]A lovely querky house with lots of history. Laurie is a wonderful host and is so helpful with information on where to eat , where to go, how to get there and avoiding the queues. 
Essential you like cats as Batman and Robin love people.
Once you have learnt the various foibles you can get your own breakfast (delicious) and come and go as you wish, which suited us perfectly and we had a wonderful time. Locally there are some excellent restaurants and wide choice, so no need to head back to Manhattan. An enjoyable place to stay.[QWERTY123]Great location, nice clean rooms and excellent shower. Easy walk to subway for 20 min ride into Manhattan.[QWERTY123]We spent a fun week with Laurie and Peter and very much appreciated here. The house is situated in a quiet neighborhood with a large choice of restaurants of all nationalities who have been recommended by Laurie. The Ten (Japanese) has been our preference. Too bad we did not meet Laurie and Peter, maybe next time. Still, everything was all set to get a good breakfast and lots of information to a pleasant stay. We had the company of a charming English couple and also we will not forget the two cats who were very sociable. A big thank you to Kim and Dani who helped us provide the best for our stay is in good condition. Finally, a place we strongly recommend to all[QWERTY123]Laurie is a gracious and very knowledgeable hostess. She knows Brooklyn very well, and she was incredibly helpful in guiding me to the  best places to eat, shop, etc. in the area. I stayed at her place while waiting for my husband to arrive from the West Coast; we just moved into the area, and Laurie made the initial transition much easier. She also has delicious croissants and cheeses available for her guests![QWERTY123]Our stay at Laurie's is probably the best experience one could ever imagine through Airbnb.  Laurie is an amazing host, a knowledgeable tour guide of New York, and a museum curator all in one.  Her home is in a great part of the city, yet on a side street where I never had a problem parking just a few feet from her front door.  Her house could be a Better Homes and Garden showpiece, and yes, it even has a large garden in her back yard.  There is artwork and books everywhere.  In fact, the photos on Airbnb don't even do justice to the beauty of the place.  The rooms are large, immaculate, and the beds are comfortable.  The espresso maker in the kitchen and fresh croissants and OJ every morning was a treat, and much better than even Starbucks can deliver!  The house management team, Batman and Robin (Laurie's two cats), were friendly and ever-present.  I couldn't think of a nicer place to stay.[QWERTY123]It was great to stay in Laurie's well situated and welcoming home in South Slope.  Laurie was so welcoming to our family of four, and never failed to give us spot on advice for our queries on eating out, places to visit and things to do.  Her home is comfortable and gracious and a joy to returw to air-conditioned rooms in the middle of a heat wave![QWERTY123]Laurie is great, lovely and welcoming. The place was really nice and with an easy access to the town. Will definetely recommend to my friends and be back! I really felt home there :-)[QWERTY123]My husband and I stayed with Laurie and her beautiful cats for a week in September. We had a fantastic stay and Laurie couldn’t have been more helpful or generous. Brooklyn was a great place to stay and Laurie’s house was close to great restaurants and the subway for easy access to Manhattan. Laurie is a fabulous host and her home was like a home away from home. A wonderful retreat in a great city! Thanks Laurie, I would love to come back.[QWERTY123]We really enjoyed our stay at Laurie Kellogg's house. The bedroom was clean and comfortable and the bathroom was clean too.We enjoyed great coffee,bagels and muffins and fresh fruit for breakfast.Laurie did everything to make us feel comfortable and gave us a lot of information about the restaurants and sightseeing in New York.She even gave us discount coupons for certain restaurants and activities(biking in Central Park).This is a great place to stay![QWERTY123]Staying with Laurie was the best part of our wonderful 6 day trip.  The entire house was very clean.  We loved our cozy room and our bed was really comfortable.  A nice variety of croisants, bagels and cheeses and that awesome expresso machine (!) made for a yummy breakfast. Every evening we felt like we were coming home.  Never felt like that staying in a hotel.  And meeting Laurie was the best part of (Website hidden by Airbnb) interesting woman who is a concierge from heaven!
We'll be back.[QWERTY123]Laurie was an excellent host.  The house and neighborhood were lovely. Laurie was always ready to help my girlfriend and I find our way around town. She showed us lots of great places to eat out and areas to tour which were very affordable. Be sure to try her awesome breakfast with organic orange juice and fresh croissants!  I would highly recommend her to anyone looking for a great vacation in NYC.[QWERTY123]HEAVEN!!!! If you""re reading this, then chances are you're in a pickle as to where to stay In New York, without having to blow your budget or take out a mortgage. You've possibly used airbnb before, and had average or bad or great experiences. You're asking yourself questions like.... Will the house and room be quiet, will it be close to subways, is it in a good area, will I have my privacy, will my host be able to help me find my way around, will my bed be comfortable, and if I wanna come home at 2 am wi after exploring the city, willll it be safe?. Well I just spent ten days of bliss at a house that was more like a home, a host that was more like a friend, in an area that couldn't be better situated. Look no further If you want a real home away from home at a great price in a great area!! Checklist. The R train is a few bllocks away, I used it to get everywhere and connect with every possible subway. You can walk in the area 24 hours with complete peace of mind. Laurie's house is on the corner of the hottest hippest liveliest street with tons of shops cafes restaurants a market and more, so u don't even have to go to Manhattan every day. You are so close to everything that you can explore every part of Brooklyn, and if u do have time and feel like a good brisk exciting walk while taking in the amazing sights oif Brooklyn,you will get you to the Brooklyn bridge, and over it i in 45.  miin. If you cycle, 2o min to Manhattan, and 10 min by subway.. So you're in the best area of New York, trust me!!! As far as the rrest of the checklist? Best bed ever, most beautiful home filled with life and history and art, quiet, tranquil, private, inhabited by the cutest cats ever, who on more than one occasion spent hours sleeping in with me one sunday after a rather late night. If I tell you I didn't hear a peep in the house I'm not lying, as the rooms are situated on the top of the beautiful house, and the apartment for rental is below and completely private and seperate from the rest of the house. The rooms have just been redecorated and spruced up for Christmas, and are truly the largest nicest rooms you could find in New York for the excellent price. I stayed on a little longer and Laurie was incredibly accomodating. She is an excpetional woman, mother and human being, intelligent talented resourceful and just sweeter than you could imagine. so don't look any further BOOK, before its all booked up![QWERTY123]We enjoyed staying at Laurie's and wished that we had more time chatting with her and scouring through her books.  She's very flexible, friendly and always ready to share her knowledge of the area.  The apartment is near to the subways as well as little cafes, restaurants, supermarkets and 24 hour pharmacy!

Both Batman and Robin (Laurie's pet cats) are simply adorable and very friendly too!  Will miss them![QWERTY123]You cannot stay in a more wonderful environment! Loved it! Laurie is´a great and caring host![QWERTY123]I have stayed with Laurie several times, and every one has been wonderful. Beautiful, clean, and warm! A glass of wine in the garden, dinner reservations made for you, and a fantastic breakfast!
I give Laurie's my highest recommendation.[QWERTY123]Thanks to Laurie, she was a wonderful host. Her cats were lovely. We arrived very late at night and she was waiting for us! Lovely house. The room was very cosy and the beds were perfect. The bathroom we had to share with other guests was no problem. Towels, shampoo etc. all was there. Great shower. Breakfast was complete. We even might take a peace of fruit for the lunch. In the evening when coming back from sightseeing we were allowed to take a cup of tea or a glas of wine, so nice. Using her computer for the internet was also possible. Laurie gave us a lot of information about New York. The area where she lives is really safe. Very easy to walk about 5 minutes to the closest subway. With the subway it took about 20 minutes to be in the centre of Manhatten. We advice her appartement to anyone who goes to NY. 
thanks Laurie.[QWERTY123]I had a pleasant, easy stay.  All the food basics were provided, especially for breakfast.  Dinner was also provided some nights.  Bringing in my own food was also allowed.  I could go out and come in at odd hours without disturbing anyone.[QWERTY123]We had a really nice time in Brooklyn. Laurie Kellogg is a magnificent host. She gives a lot of tips and useful advice about things to see & do, good restaurants, bars, subway schedules, ... We stayed in a room with double bed on the top floor: a quiet place to sleep. It's a house with a history... lots of books, pictures and drawings. A bit messy but really cosy. We felt at home immediately. Laurie can also provide breakfast if needed: organic orange juice, croissants & fruits. We enjoyed it a lot! Thanks Laurie for such a wonderful stay![QWERTY123]There are homes and there are homes. Some look like a House Beautiful photo spread, but do not have heart. Others are living breathing expressions of their owner's creativity and vitality. 
     I am not going to waste your time with a catalogue of the amenities which were all first-class all the way (special mention, however, to the superb coffee and croissants and the lush towels, and the comfortable beds and the generous showers and the warm inviting old wood floors that glowed under the lights ).  
     Rather, I prefer to share that this home is a true oasis in a busy city, one that nourishes the soul with real artists' art, with personable cats, with conversation, with books that reflect Laurie's expansive interests.  This grand old house presents a gracious hospitality to all who visit. 
     Laurie is a wealth of information about the heartbeat of the city outside her door, and is responsive to your every request.  All of the above at a reasonable rate, you can't go wrong. 
Thanks Laurie,
Colin[QWERTY123]We were delighted with our stay at Laurie's place. Her home is as warm and beautiful as the pix show. The area has a real feel of community about it and Laurie gave us invaluable advice on where to eat and find Jazz. We would heartily recommend this as a great place to stay, whether Brooklyn is your final destination or if, like us, NYC is where it is at!
Looking forward to returning,
Joan.[QWERTY123]My stay at Laurie's home was delightful!  Park Slope is such a great neighborhood, and Laurie helped me to find good restaurants and things to do nearby.  She really loves Park Slope and New York, and makes sure that her guests have the info they need to have a rich and vivid experience while in town.  I arrived way too early from a red eye flight, and Laurie was very gracious to let me wait in her living room and get settled in as soon as the room was ready.  Staying in a home versus a hotel is just what I needed on my business trip, and the location is superb... close to transit, close to Prospect Park for much needed walks and quiet moments.  This will the be the first place I search for when I'm in town next and I'm really grateful I found it.[QWERTY123]Had a GREAT time at Laurie´s and Peter´s place they are so nice! The house is big and very quite! They are always  willing to help.  Highly recommended :) Thank you Laurie and Peter, hope to visit you soon :)[QWERTY123]Warm welcome, feel my like at home, beautiful to discover a part of real  Brooklyn by bike. Thank you so much, Laurie.[QWERTY123]I had a lovely stay at Laurie's beautiful home in Brooklyn. It was my first time in New York and all the advice and information she shared was extremely helpful and valuable. Her house is conveniently situated near a subway station with great connections. This gave me easy access to everything I wanted to see - only 20 minutes to Manhattan. All in all, it was a pleasure staying with Laurie and her very handsome son, Peter.[QWERTY123]Great stay with Laurie in lovely Park Slope. Transportation to Manhattan was easy and tons of great restaurants close by. Clean room and bathroom, cute cats and tons of great recommendations from Laurie.[QWERTY123]It was our first Airbnb stay and Laurie was very welcoming! She was very thoughtful about us and made us feel home. I liked the lovely two cats!!
And has nice garden :)
Maybe the bed was too soft for me but other than that, everything was very comfortable! Thank you very much Laurie!!! We enjoyed our stay in New York![QWERTY123]Laurie´s place is all about care and details. I flet like home. I have really enjoyed mi time in Brooklyn. This house is awesome and very well located, near to Prospect Park and the aera is full of good restaurents and bars with live music and it is very easy to go to Manhattan by subway. I recommend Laurie´s house for your NYC vacation. Laurie was professional, very friendly and a wonderful host giving recommendations for my stay in Brooklyn. She also led me her bike for enjoying a beatiful day in Governors Island.

Looking forward to returning.

Luis[QWERTY123]Laurie was informative as to places to eat in area as well as transportation needs.  Home has a very lived in feel.  Room was comfortable with the use of the air conditioner.  Sharing the bathroom was not a problem as I left early in morning most days.[QWERTY123]We had a great stay at Laurie's place - it was perfect for all our needs. Park Slope is a great neighborhood, nice and quiet too, and Laurie's house is close to 3 very convenient subway lines. Laurie was very helpful in telling us where the best local places are for pizza, bagels etc. Not that we ever actually went out for bagels in the end - Laurie had the most amazing bagels, cream cheese and orange juice I have ever tasted!![QWERTY123]Laurie is a terrific person. Knowledgeable, helpful, good taste and extremely warm. 

Gorgeous house doesn't go far enough as a description. Comfortable, clean, private and spacious. We had no idea that we could feel so at home in a foreign country. Brooklyn is amazing, the people are friendly and fun and helpful. The trains are all very close. Laurie's coffee maker is awesome. 

It is my opinion that there is no better way to stay in NYC.  

We had an unbelievable time. Simply immaculate![QWERTY123]laurie's 140+ glowing reviews can't be wrong! she's got a gorgeous house with a fantastic setup in a perfect location. she's proud to call brooklyn home and is passionate about sharing the things she finds special about her city and her borough. listen to her recommendations; she knows what she's talking about! 

garden/backyard space is virtually unheard of in new york and laurie's got a truly beautiful back patio and garden. take advantage of relaxing out there with your morning coffee if weather permits!

park slope is an adorable neighborhood and a welcome respite from the over-stimulation of manhattan. being so close to so many great restaurants, markets, shops and the park should sell you on this place if nothing else has.

bottom line: if you're looking for an alternative to a standard (Hidden by Airbnb) -type place and want the opportunity to stay with someone who's as invested in you enjoying your trip as you are, laurie's what you're looking for![QWERTY123]Great location conveniently located within 4 blocks of the subway and two stops of transfers, coffee joints, restaurants and even a wonderful patisserie.  Venture a little further by foot or train and find a plethora of boutiques, eats, bars and BAM (a Brooklyn gem!)

Laurie is warm and welcoming as is her lovely home.  Coffee and breakfast snacks were a plus and the conversation was priceless. The shared bath was no problem and had a hair dryer, the house is quiet and the bed was comfortable.  You'll have access to countless maps, area menus and suggestions for things to do and places to go.  Help and smiles are available when you need but never intrusive.  Will stay again next time I return.  Thank you Laurie![QWERTY123]Laurie treated us like her family during our stay when we got hit by Hurricane Sandy. We felt very protected at her house that never lost power. Park Slope is a wonderful neighborhood to stay and stroll. Lots of great restaurants and shops on 5th and 7th Avenues which are all in walking distance from the house, but still it's very quiet.  We never got bored when we couldn't reach Manhattan. Great organic breakfast foods in the fridge, fancy espresso machine,  and beautiful art work everywhere in the house. Above all, Laurie is a very warm hearted hostess we can count on.[QWERTY123]Laurie's home was the perfect place for my nine days in Brooklyn. I was visiting my daughter/husband/and baby who live just a few blocks away. It was nice to come ""home"" to a quiet/comfy room after a long, busy day. It was also wonderful to have breakfast and coffee every morning. Right after I arrived she texted me to find out what I liked for breakfast. Plus, she has a wonderful espresso machine. Laurie was a great host. We only crossed paths a few times, which was fine, but she keeps in touch to make sure your stay is going well. Thank you Laurie!

Nov./Dec. 2012[QWERTY123]You would have to be crazy not to stay with Laurie! Five stars is not enough. My fiancée and I had a fantastic time in New York thanks to Laurie. We hadn't done any prior planning when we arrived and she helped us with our itinerary, gave us tips for restaurants and experiences and showed us the REAL soul of New York. When attending a recommended, very special intimate jazz performance in Harlem the person next to us commented it was amazing to see us there because most locals don't even know about it! That is exactly the kind of experience you will get staying with Laurie!
Her home is very clean and comfortable and we felt very welcome there. At the same time you were given plenty of space and freedom to do as you please. Breakfast is indulgently catered. Location is unbeatable and we had NO problems getting back home and felt safe even late at night. Laurie is a generous host and we would love to stay with her again![QWERTY123]I had a wonderful, comfortable and educational stay at Laurie's bnb!
The spacious 4 story house is beautiful and has so much character that you just can't spend enough time looking at everything, especially all the art work! The Almond croissants in the morning were delectable and Laurie always has great advice to give about how to get to different places and where to go in Brooklyn to see the best french musician, at a secret little place that not many know about!
Thanks Laurie![QWERTY123]Laurie's house is beautiful--open, full of wonderful art and cozy. It is in a safe neighborhood, near the subway and Prospect Park. She was a thoughtful host--I recommend her to anyone.[QWERTY123]Our stay at Laurie's place was just perfect! We especially enjoyed the daily breakfast, the presence of the cats and the lovely neighbourhood... For more than a week, we felt like real New Yorkers! There's no reason to stay in a hotel ;)[QWERTY123]Laurie is more than a Hostess. she is a city guide, a friend and a mother! she took care of us with so much love and she help us move around town with incredible suggestions about places to visit (like the Brooklyn Museum, forget about the MET!) and great places to eat. Her son Peter is always willing to give you a hand and her two cats are so full of love and tenderness. 

The house is great, just as you see it on the photographs, which was a great relief for us. 

we had a great time and we felt at home all the time.[QWERTY123]I had great stay at Laurie's. The apartment is very nice, clean and comfortable. It's walking distance to subway, you can easily get to Manhattan. Wonderful house with very welcoming host.[QWERTY123]Laurie's home is wonderful.  quiet and clean and comfortable.  She is a wealth of knowledge and fun.  She was very nice/understanding when I let out the cat- but it is not recommended.
[QWERTY123]Great and quiet neighbourhood, even though it is in the middle of the heart of Brooklyn, very clean and nice atmosphere, terrific breakfast and a great host. Thank you Laurie!!![QWERTY123]Laurie was an excellent host! It was the perfect location for us to be able to walk everywhere and really enjoy being in Brooklyn. She had great recommendations for places to eat and things to do. We'll definitely be back. Thanks![QWERTY123]For me Laurie and her house was perfect. Located between the film festival I was attending and the gym, I couldn't have asked for a better location. Plus I got the use of the kitchen so I saved money by cooking for one or two meals a day. There were markets close by and even 99 cent stores for the razors, tooth brush and gym lock I forgot to bring. Laurie lent me an umbrella when I needed it. She's very cool and mothering. I also love her adorable, friendly cats, Batman and Robin. The whole experience was very relaxed and comfortable with that homey and eclectic feeling. There's wonderful art all over the house from her family and friends and a two too narrow creaky staircases which led to my adorable room. I liked the bathroom as well which allowed me good lighting to prepare for my nights out. Laurie also helped me navigate the subways with instruction and maps and recommend her friendly and efficient car service. Nearby is the Brooklyn museum which had the most awesome John Paul Gaultier fashion show and of course there's Manhattan which is incredible for exploring only a subway ride away. I hope to stay there again![QWERTY123]Laurie's home is warm and welcoming and so is Laurie. We liked the relaxed atmosphere, and the delicious croissants and yoghurt / cereal for breakfast every day. The house is in an elegant tree lined street close to the subway, and the cafes, food stores and interesting shops on 5th and 7th avenues. We found good coffee just round the corner at Cafe Regular on 11th st. Loved  the margaritas at Rachel's taqueria, and the jazz duo at Oliviers ...both recommended by Laurie. The F train took us directly to Manhattan. It was ideal to start our time in NY in a more low key way in Park Slope. Thank you Laurie![QWERTY123]We had a perfect four day stay at Laurie's wonderful Park Slope home -- close to the F Train to Manhattan, great restaurants and cafes nearby, and the world's friendliest cats.  Even found the perfect parking space right across the street!  We'll definitely be back.[QWERTY123]A great space in a great neighborhood, right near 5th ave shops and restaurants.  My stay with Laurie was lovely -- she even made sure I had breakfast every morning before I left her house.  A clean, quiet and sun filled room were perfect after long days spent in the city.  I really enjoyed looking at the beautiful artwork on the walls, too.  Laurie is extremely knowledgable about the city and even had a list of holiday windows she recommended seeing on my trip!  I recommend this place to fellow travelers.[QWERTY123]Laurie was a gracious hostess who not only gave us helpful tips about how to enjoy the New York experience, but also provided fresh bagels and croissants every morning.  The bedroom was clean, the neighborhood environment was quiet and safe, and the bed was very comfortable.  We stayed on the top floor of her home and shared a bath with a lovely woman and her daughter visiting from the Netherlands.  Staying with Laurie was one of the highlights of our holiday trip to New York![QWERTY123]Croissants, cats and comfy bed. Laurie promises the best almond croissants you've ever tasted and she delivers. Batman and Robin, the cats, will nap with you if desired. My room, overlooking the garden, had one of those foam tops so I sank into it as if embraced. Great coffee on tap. Sun pouring in through the windows overlooking the garden. Some great suggestions from Laurie - things you wouldn't find on your own. Short walk to the subway. Quiet street near lots of cafes and shops.[QWERTY123]Laurie is friendly, kind, and an great host. I was there for work and felt completely at ease going in and out as I pleased. It was great having an opportunity to communicate and chat with the other guests from Germany and the USA. Location is awesome. Room has everything you need. 

The bagels with cream cheese were awesome.[QWERTY123]Laurie and Chavi made us feel very welcome, and the room was perfectly situated for a trip to Brooklyn. We were out nearly all of the time so did not make much use of the breakfast, but it was great to know it was available, and the whole place was very homey - a real find in Brooklyn. In particular, given the extreme weather, the room was warm, the beds were clean and comfy and the cats very welcoming too. Would recommend this room to anyone who wants a home from home experience.[QWERTY123]Laurie she's direct and natural.. she's a good hOst ! her house in Park slOpe ,Brooklyn is really good for mind ..colors and many drawings with sun ! and a nice garden with coffee tables ...and also two cute cats ! Batman and Robin to save us in case of disaster ! thank you Laurie for this nice week in yOur lOvely hOme  ![QWERTY123]We hebben genoten van de warme gastvrijheid van Laurie! Ze maakte tijd voor ons en haar tips hebben zeker bijgedragen aan ons heerlijke verblijf in 'the Big Apple'. Het huis staat in een prima buurt, vlakbij winkels, restaurants en metro. Wij (twee vrouwen) voelden ons veilig in de buurt en gingen dus ook zonder problemen 's avonds nog op pad voor een restaurantbezoek. Vervoer vanuit JFK naar het huis van Laurie is een dingetje. Shuttlediensten rijden niet naar Brooklyn. Openbaar vervoer vonden wij vanwege het overstappen met koffers geen goed plan. Taxibedrijf Eastern wordt door Laurie aanbevolen. Echter, je kunt alleen vooraf reserveren als je een mobiel met USA-nummer hebt. Bleef voor ons de Yellow Cab over. De Yellow Cab die wij namen gaf $62 aan op de meter, veel meer dan het vaste tarief van $35 van Eastern. Oplossing: bel als je op JFK aankomt met een public phone gratis naar Eastern via (Phone number hidden by Airbnb) Dan zou een taxi na ongeveer 20 minuten arriveren. Weer even bellen als het wat langer duurt. Wel goed aangeven waar je staat :-). Verder adviseer ik de minder mobiele gasten het appartement te huren in de souterrain. De andere twee kamers zijn namelijk op zolder en daarvoor moet je 2,5 flinke steile trappen op. Alles bij elkaar zijn we erg enthousiast over ons verblijf bij Laurie: we komen graag terug![QWERTY123]The reservation was canceled 66 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.[QWERTY123]Fue una buena experiencia. La habitación y el baño estaban muy cómodos y limpios. La señora fue muy querida dando la información del sector. Es un sitio muy tranquilo y está muy cerca del Metro y de Manhattan. Ella fue muy gentil en las mañanas al ofrecernos un delicioso café con croissants y frutas.
Muchas gracias Laurie.

[QWERTY123]We had a great time at Laurie's house. She is very friendly and welcoming, gives lots of helpful suggestions and offers some fine breakfast. The cats Batman and Robin are very hospitable, too. The house is very comfortable and clean, and the neighborhood is nice and safe. Make sure to check out the childrenbooks illustrated by Steven Kellogg![QWERTY123]Ich habe zwei Wochen bei Laurie gewohnt und die Zeit dort sehr genossen.
Es ist ein wunderbares, altes gemütliches Haus in Brooklyn, mit vielen Kunstwerken ( auch von ihrem Vater, der ein bekannter Kinderbuch-Illustrator war ) und unzähligen Büchern.
Die Nachbarschaft ist freundlich und schön und zur Subway nach Manhattan sind es nur wenige Schritte.
Laurie ist bestens informiert über alles, was in New York vor sich geht und gibt einem tolle Tips.
Bei meinem nächsten Aufenthalt in New York werde ich auf jeden Fall gerne zu Laurie zurückkehren.[QWERTY123]The location is great for doing things in Brooklyn. We were warmly greeted and found the accommodations very comfortable. The shared bath on our floor was with just 1 other person. We slept well and it was easy to help ourselves to breakfast on our early schedule. We enjoyed visiting with Laurie and her assistant. We anticipate on staying here again in the spring.[QWERTY123]We hebben een fijne tijd gehad in New York/Brooklyn. Het mooie huis van Laurie ligt in een rustige buurt met volop restaurantjes op loopafstand. De subway is binnen 10 minuten te bereiken. Tevens is er een mooi park in de buurt. De twee persoonskamer met gedeelde badkamer was prima. Groot genoeg voor twee personen. Ontbijt konden we zelf maken en was heerlijk met croissants, zoete broodjes, yoghurt, gewoon brood en fruit.
Laurie was erg behulpzaam en had vele goede tips over New York en Brooklyn. En de poezen waren gezellig aanwezig.[QWERTY123]Laurie was awesome! Gave great directions, was communicative and honest about the place. The room was as described and the beds were comfy. The neighbourhood is beautiful and has a lot of cute restaurants, shops and dwellings.[QWERTY123]The perfect experience: very clean (amazing shower- hot and powerful), very well situated, extremely generous host, very beautiful home. We feel already a bit nostalgic, loved the cats, the garden, the delicious teas and enormous toasts for breakfast. Also, not only will Laurie happily explain how to get around, but she will provide excellent addresses for food and good tips for cultural outtings. Full library of New York magazines, guides, as well as lots of flyers to guide you around this very nice area and generally NYC. She really does a lot to help you and it makes it so unique. So cool about the open flexible check-in check-out time: no arrival time plus we could leave our bags for the day of our departure and , and it helped a lot. Thank you for everything Laurie![QWERTY123]We had a great week at Lauries. The house was very homey and the bedroom very comfortable.  Laurie also provides some breakfast in the mornings, to fuel up for a days sightseeing. The two cats will also be there to keep you company! 

Brooklyn is a great place to visit and you could easily spend a week alone just seeing that district. Luckily Laurie was able to provide us with some great suggestions which were well worth listening to! 

The house is close to great bars and restaurants on 5th ave and a number of subway lines only a few minutes walk away.  We were lucky enough to catch the nyc marathon whilst we were there and enjoyed the rest of the city too! 

Thanks Laurie for a great trip![QWERTY123]I booked this pretty place for four nights and ended up staying five.  I really enjoyed myself there and felt very comfortable.  Laurie was very accommodating while my plans kept changing--first there were two of us coming, then just one, then whoops, two for a while, just one for the rest, etc.  The house looks exactly as depicted--pretty, full of light, full of color, and full of interesting things collected with an artist's eye.  I really enjoyed the illustrations from famous children's book authors, including Laurie's own father.  The bed was very comfortable, the water pressure great, everything clean and nicely thought out.  Laurie is very interesting and I really enjoyed my conversations with her.  Oh and the house is just a few blocks to the subways that go into Manhattan quickly and easily.  There is also lots to explore in the pretty neighborhood (good food too, which Chavi and Laurie can point you toward).  I ended up sleeping the extra night in the downstairs garden apartment--also very comfortable and inviting.  I was ready to move in.  I would definitely go back to Laurie's house.  I felt like a happy houseguest staying with interesting friends.[QWERTY123]The house is absolutely stunning, tastefully arranged, with plenty of space, natural light and tons of character. A true home away from home.

South Slope is a beautiful and quiet, historic residential neighbourhood and a pleasure to walk about even in gloomy weather, of which we unfortunately got a fair share. This is unavoidable this time of the year though - a clear incentive to come back when it gets warmer!

Laurie was a wonderful host. She provided us with a variety of suggestions and advice regarding our sightseeing choices and - it must be said - we owe a great part of our most unforgettable memories (live music in particular) to Laurie's local knowledge - and her willingness to share it!

I would definitely recommend Laurie's place to anyone looking for a NYC experience with a homely touch.[QWERTY123]Our stay with Laurie had been a very pleasant one. Laurie was very friendly and helpful in recommending places to visit and eat. She was also very kind to prepare breakfast for us during our stay. We had a great time and will definitely visit Brooklyn again![QWERTY123]This a great place in a great neighbourhood. It's easy to get around and Park Slope itself is great. Laurie has a lot of great tips on where to go and how to get there. The two cats are so cute and really made my day. If you are staying in one of the rooms, keep in mind that the bathroom is shared with the other guest and that the kitchen is shared with Laurie.[QWERTY123]Bon accueil à Brooklyn, maison très agréable correspondant à la description.Nous nous y sommes sentis à l'aise dès notre arrivée. Le quartier est calme et il y a à proximité de la maison magasins et restaurants dans la 5éme avenue. Séjour très plaisant à Brooklyn.[QWERTY123]Magnifique accueil de la part de Laurie qui nous a ouvert sa maison et son jardin pour un séjour d'une semaine dans Brooklyn. Une personne rare, généreuse et engagée. Manhattan vu de Brooklyn est une révélation depuis les magnifiques promenades aménagée. Les quartiers tous tellement différents et intéressants et ce havre de paix qu'est la maison où il fait bon se retirer et prendre de généreux petits déjeuners dans le patio et le jardin...merci Laurie[QWERTY123]My girlfriend and I had a lovely stay at Laurie's place. Beautiful home with a nice back garden.  It's a great neighborhood and Laurie has great restaurant recommendations!  Just a couple blocks from the subway. We would stay again![QWERTY123]Laurie is an excellent host! The neighbourhood is great, close to a number of amenities including the subway. Laurie has a beautiful home and provided us with everything we needed, including helping us into her home when we arrived very late at night.
Breakfasts were delicious and the water pressure is fantastic. Laurie also helped us supplement our trip with great suggestions for sites to visit, things to do, and where to eat.[QWERTY123]Très bon logement à 300 mètres du métro ligne G et F (parfait pour Manhattan). Quartier sûr!
Chambre spacieuse, mais lit trop mou..
Salle de bain réservé aux chambres, très propre.
Petit déjeuner le matin (jus, fruit, etc..)
Idéal si vous n'attendez pas plus de relationnel avec l'hôte (qui parle un peu le français).
[QWERTY123]Laurie is a most welcoming and easygoing host and her home is lovely.Close to lots and lots of restaurants and coffee shops .Just a few blocks to subway.Park Slope is a great neighborhood too...very safe and close enough to enjoy the park if you wish to enjoy it.Batman ,Robin and son Peter were delightful additions to our stay.Thank you Laurie for everything[QWERTY123]I had a great time at Laurie's. She was so helpful, always made sure if I had everything I needed. The house is so cozy and clean. Great neighborhood with lots of nice restaurants, stores, 10-minute walk to the Prospect Park which I loved going in the morning. Would love to stay again![QWERTY123]Laurie's place is in a quiet neighbourhood near Manhattan. Several metro stations are very close to the house and that makes things much easier. The room was big and very nice,and the bed was very comfortable which is one of the main things when you book a room. Laurie is a gentle host and it is always available to help you with reccomendations about the city. If you're not staying in Manhattan that is the perfect place to go for sure.[QWERTY123]Laurie is an ideal airbnb host.   She is friendly, easy-going, and makes you feel at home immediately.  She is incredibly knowledgable about her fabulous neighbourhood and provides guests a very helpful guide that suggests local restaurants and music venues.  I have stayed in Park Slope many times and love the neighbourhood.  I stayed in one of the upstairs bedrooms for part of my stay, and I also rented the downstairs apartment when my husband arrived.   Both were exactly as advertised and both were very comfortable.  I highly recommend staying in Park Slope at Laurie's wonderful home.  
[QWERTY123]We had a wonderful stay at Laurie's charming house. The room was nice and the beds very comfortable.
Laurie is a great host and had a lot of helpful tips for restaurants, bars and places to visit in Brooklyn. The subway station is a just a few minutes away which made it easy to move around.
I would definitely recommend her place to others and hope that I will be able to stay at Laurie's place again when back in New York.[QWERTY123]Mycket trevligt boende på lagom avstånd från Manhattan. Lugnt och trevligt område med nära till restauranger och butiker när man inte orkar ta sig in till kaoset i stan. Fint bemötande och två härliga katter. Härlig trädgård för frukost med extra njutning.[QWERTY123]Laurie var en jättebra värdinna och man kände sig varmt välkommen i huset. Rummet var fantastiskt vackert och bekvämt och vi hade allt vi behövde. Laurie hade bra tips och idéer om attraktioner, barer, restauranger och affärer som man kunde besöka både i Brooklyn och på manhattan som hon delade med oss. Jag och min sambo hade en underbar vistelse i Brooklyn. Huset är oerhört vackert och bra standard och beläget i ett vackert område nära till restauranger och barer! Vi rekommenderar varmt att stanna hos Laurie i Brooklyn.[QWERTY123]Highly recommend this accommodation. Laurie was soo accommodating, lovely and helpful. Her home is beautiful full of character and great Neighborhood. Close to metro with optional routes to get home (Laurie went over the maps and option with me upon arrival). Prospect park, botanical garden, cafes and resturants close by. Really enjoyed our stay.[QWERTY123]Laurie's place is the best that i had on airbnb. The room was cozy, clean and very comfortable. The house is big and you have your own privacy. Laurie is very welcome and willing to share her knowledge about whatever you need. the neighborhood is safe and got everything, with cool coffee and shops around. i really enjoy there and think this place is great for a long period[QWERTY123]Laurie was extremely welcoming and friendly to us when we arrived. She actually sat down with us to explain the entire New York Subway. We felt so heart warmed by that gesture.
Breakfast was simple,and yet the quality of the food was astounding. We love the bagels and cream cheese! and we absolutely love the pears there!!
Thank you Laurie,for the lovely time there :)[QWERTY123]Laurie made us feel very welcome.  Her home is well equipped to handle visitors and we could be very independent since instructions were sent prior to our visit.  The beds were comfortable and the bath was always accessible, although shared.[QWERTY123]The location was perfect!  I enjoyed the stay immensely and would definitely recommend Laurie as a top-notch host that cares about her guests.  She clued us into great local things to do that never disappointed.  It definitely felt like a welcome home away from home.[QWERTY123]很好的地理位置[QWERTY123]The house is clean and well located, closed to the Amazing Prospect Park and bars of the Fifth Avenue. The room was warm (good, because it was on winter) and Laurie and Chad had been really helpfull. Laurie is not only an amazing host but also an incredible perron with great values and strong will. I will definitely go there again when I'll be in NY. Thanks Laurie.[QWERTY123]Laurie's place was absolutely lovely and had so much character[QWERTY123]Lovely home with two very sweet hearted cats. My boyfriend and me stayed at Laurie's home for one week and we felt us quite welcome and comfortable. A metro station is near by Laurie's home and the area (Brooklyn) is also quite pretty. Our room and the bathroom were clean and we slept there very well. Our week was wonderful, we had a great time!!!
Thank you Laurie :)[QWERTY123]Laurie è una bravissima e gentilissima host, è stata disponibilissima mi ha spiegato come funzionava la metropolitana mi ha consigliato i posti da vedere sia in Brooklyn che a Manhattan, la colazione sempre buonissima, la casa molto bella, la mia camera molto spaziosa, il bagno carino, situata in una posizione a 2 minuti a piede dalla prima fermata della metro le altre poco distanti.
Grazie Laurie,  sicuramente tornerò da lei nei miei prossimi viaggi a New York
[QWERTY123]Laurie hat uns persönlich empfangen und gleich mit Tipps und Ratschlägen versorgt. Es gibt auch ein Booklett, in dem Tipps für Lokale und Sehenswürdigkeiten in der näheren oder weiteren Umgebung aufgelistet sind. Es wäre hilfreich, wenn die Anhänge an die Mails verlässlich beim Empfänger ankämen. Das Frühstück ist wirklich vielfältig und reichlich. Außerdem kann man immer nehmen, was man möchte. Laurie war zwar nicht oft persönlich anzutreffen, aber immer erreichbar und kümmerte sich per Mail um uns. Als Ruhepol eignet sich die Gegend und das Haus ausgezeichnet.[QWERTY123]Laurie's home was lovely and cozy - even better than the pictures. The location is super great - subway station right around the corner with direct connection to Manhattan. Laurie gave us everything we needed and great recommendations on what to do and where to eat. We will definitely come back and had a blast![QWERTY123]La casa está situada en un barrio en Brooklyn, muy cerca del metro, lo que hace fácil el traslado a Manhattan. La pieza que elegimos (dos camas angostas) está en el tercer piso, lo que es bueno tener en cuenta para personas con poca movilidad o maletas muy pesadas!, también este piso es el más caluroso. El resto de la casa es linda pero es mucho más ordenada en las fotos que en la realidad, realmente se siente como la casa de una artista! La pieza estaba ordenada y limpia y el baño también. El jardín es muy bonito y preferimos tomar desayuno ahí, que además era muy rico. 
A pesar de que vimos poco a Laurie, ella trató de ayudarnos en lo que pudo, solucionar el tema del calor y darnos excelentes datos sobre el barrio y alrededores.  Muchas gracias![QWERTY123]I had an awesome stay in New York - Laurie and her house contributed to making it great! When I arrived, Laurie welcomed me with recommendations what to do in the area, showed me around the house and provided valuable instructions for transportation. The room is spacious, and nicely furnished like the rest of the house. 
I felt safe in the area and was happy that I chose Brooklyn to stay - really nice bars and affordable places to have lunch or dinner. 
Also connections with the fast trains was convenient. In a nutshell: I would stay with Laurie again and highly recommend![QWERTY123]Zeer goede locatie voor een trip naar New York. Gelegen in een zeer rustige omgeving, 30min op de metro tot centrum Manhattan. Laurie helpt je op weg met tips over transport en events. We voelden ons er meteen thuis en werden uitgenodigd op haar feestje. Aanrader :)[QWERTY123]Très belle maison typique de Brooklyn située dans un quartier très calme et à 5 minutes à pied du métro. Laurie est une personne très accueillante et toujours prête à nous renseigner. Nous reviendrons chez elle avec grand plaisir.[QWERTY123]I got a lovely welcome pack from Laurie with loads of information about the area, and transport to and from the place. The room was air conditioned (absolutely necessary in New York summer time!) and perfectly comfortable. I didn't run into Laurie until my second morning in the place as our schedules didn't overlap, but I had everything I needed anyway, and once we did get a chance to chat she was warm and friendly and interesting.[QWERTY123]Laurie is a wonderful host and her place is stunning. Every piece of art on her walls tells a story and there is so much character! Laurie had lots of great tips about the neighborhood and was a very gracious host. We very much enjoyed our stay. Thanks Laurie![QWERTY123]とてもﾌﾚﾝﾄﾞﾘｰなﾎｽﾄとｽﾀｯﾌで､
とても便利な場所にあります｡
またNYCに行くときは､
是非お世話になりたいと思います｡
ありがとうございました｡[QWERTY123]io e mia sorella siamo state a casa di Laurie dal 5 al 13 settembre, casa pulitissima e a pochi metri dalla stazione per il centro. 
Unica pecca, al nostro arrivo purtroppo Laurie non c'era e ci hanno accolto due ospiti, ma che comunque hanno saputo essere gentili e disponibili. 
Laurie è arrivata verso il termine della nostra vacanza e anche lei è stata davvero disponibile con noi, peccato non averla conosciuta meglio! 
In ogni caso consigliamo vivamente casa di Laurie, che per quel poco che abbiamo avuto a che fare si è rivelata una persona davvero carina! Un abbraccio da Roma e grazie di tutto!![QWERTY123]We really had nice time in NY because of her great hospitality and kindness.
The location is quite good, F train
goes to central directly, there are many nice restaurants,cafes and Prospect park nearby. If you have cat allergies, I don't recommend you to stay here. We stayed third floor, the cat came into our room every morning. Laurie is great host. Thank you so much once again! :)[QWERTY123]Laurie provides an excellent booklet chocked full of information necessary to making the stay comfortable and easy.  This neighborhood couldn't have been any better, easy walking to the subway, neighborhood restaurants and shops.  A family neighborhood, felt perfectly safe, even late at night coming back from the subway.  When I go back to Brooklyn, I'm hoping I can make my home away from home at Laurie's beautiful home.[QWERTY123]La signora Laurie è stata gentilissima, ricca di informazioni e molto precisa. Ad un giorno dalla partenza ho avuto un ricovero di un familiare e sono stato impossibilitato a partire. La signora Laurie è stata gentilissima e mi ha stornato il pagamento anticipato al netto delle tasse. Se tornerò a N.Y. andrò da lei. Mi sento di consigliarlo senza esserci andate, vista la correttezza e precisione[QWERTY123]Staying with Laurie was one of the best Airbnb experience we ever had! Not like other Airbnb host that you will never meet, the room that is perfectly organized which made you feel like a hotel room, Laurie is there for you, she talks to you, we shared our stories, opinions, laughed together, listened to the presidential debates together, it all makes us feel like visiting a family relative in NYC rather than staying thousands miles away from home knowing nothing and no one; the house is spacious, artistic, Laurie put all her stuff in the house(without segregation to the guests) without putting extra effort to make them look good or fancy but you can easily feel the artistic yet homy atmosphere, the moment you walk into the door you will feel like I'm home, again!Not mentioning the unlimited juice, yoghurt and cream cheese(with scallions! Perfect match with bagels, Yummy! Laurie will always think that you put too less cheesy on the bagel, do put as much as possible, American way! ;) ) available to you.
I think Laurie is the best representative of what the best Airbnb can bring about: share, trust, good taste and human![QWERTY123]Me and my 19 year old daughter spent one week at Laurie`s place in Brooklyn. Laurie really made us feel comfortable and gave us good tipps for our stay in NY. The house is great and we had our privacy even though other poeple were around at some times. 
The rooms were clean, shampoo and hairdryer were offered. 
Around the corner, on the 5th Av, we got everything for our needs. 
The neighbourhood was safe. In about a few minutes we got to the substation and in about 20 Minutes we got to Manhattan. We took the train until 11 `clock p.m. When coming back later on, we took a taxi, the prices were reasonable. Thank you Laurie for offering us a great breakfast (Bagels, yummie cream cheese, Orangejuice and Coffee) We didn`t take it for granted. We enjoyed our stay that much. At the end, the booklet is great and very helpful. Thank you so much. 
Regards, 
A and M[QWERTY123]Laurie has a great place in South Slope, the bedroom was nice and big and had a window which was great. The house was beautiful and nice and clean. I would recommend this airbnb for folks not familiar with the area, as Lori has lots of tips and suggestions for tourists. 
The only negative about my stay was in the middle of the night when a cat scratched at my door and woke me up with meowing- only a sore spot for me because I am not a cat person! Just happened the one time though, and I was able to fall right back asleep. Maybe this is something you sign up for when booking an airbnb with cats :) 
Thanks for a nice stay, Laurie![QWERTY123]Great location! We spent 3 nights and had a great time.[QWERTY123]Laurie was awesome...she actually drove me around to the best places to purchase wine,cupcakes,pies and all the fixings for my Thanksgiving dinner which she let me host at her Airbnb. 
I will try to stay there again and again: )[QWERTY123]Laurie is a great host. Even tough theres a lot of stress just before christmas she found time for me to give me really good recommendations  every day. She knows where to eat, where the best christmas windows is located and when the museums have special offers. If you want to try being a Brooklyner for a short time, this is where you should stay.[QWERTY123]Inside - Just imagine you are in your grandma's house. The guest floor is family hotel-like, clean, well equipped and decorated, and detail-oriented. The main floor is cozy and warm, where, besides interacting with other interesting guests, you find the host welcome you and try to make you feel comfortable.

Outside - Park slope, is among the top neighborhoods in New York City: 5-10 minutes walk to the prospect park, 15-20 minutes walk to the barclays center/downtown brooklyn, two blocks away to the nearby subway stations and Manhattan is 20 minutes away by train.[QWERTY123]Lauries Haus ist ein historisches Gebäude und etwa 140 Jahre alt. Wir lieben es, in diesen Häusern eine Zeit verbringen zu dürfen. Die Wohnlage ist für Unternehmungen in Brooklyn und Manhattan günstig. Auch gut von JFK zu erreichen. Die Lage ist ruhig. In der Umgebung sind gute Restaurants zu finden. Sehr schön ist ein Booklet, das Laurie vorab zur Information zusendet. Uns hat es insgesamt sehr gut gefallen.
Karola und Heinrich 
Helmstedt, Deutschland[QWERTY123]Staying at Laurie's lovely home in Brooklyn was what the Air B and B experience is all about, at least for me. Easy and clear instructions upon arrival and a feeling of being a welcome guest in a lovely home in Park Slope Brooklyn. Laurie is a busy person but always available if needed to provide guests with advice and assistance. My room was pleasant and quiet and the bed extremely comfortable. The bathroom always had hot water and was shared by guests in the second room on the floor but that was never an issue for me. Laurie always made sure there was plenty of bagels, croissants, cereal, and of course the delicious coffee. Subway is five minutes walk. There's plenty to see and do in Brooklyn and the area is a pleasure to simply wander around. I recommend a visit to the vast Brooklyn Green Wood cemetery if you feel like a ramble in a quiet and beautiful space only twenty minutes walk from Laurie's house. 
As if all this wasn't enough there is Laurie's pretty garden at the back with tables and chairs for guests to enjoy sitting out. I couldn't have asked for more as it was the perfect spot for me to do tai chi each morning.
If I am fortunate enough to return to New York I wouldn't think of staying anywhere else but with Laurie in her warm and welcoming book filled home.[QWERTY123]Maison très calme, beau jardin fleuri, hôtesse très chaleureuse mais malheureusement pas très présente en semaine.[QWERTY123]We had such a great stay at Laurie's place. We booked kind of last minute but Laurie was very quick to answer.
She sent us a booklet With a lot of information about her place and the places to see around and in New York and restaurants suggestions, it was perfect!
The place is near the metro that took us directly to the places we wanted to visit in Manhattan or Brooklyn but there are also great places to see nearby (Prospect Park).
The room was perfect, quiet, we shared the bathroom with the people in the room next to ours which was not a problem at all. Everything was very clean.
We arrived late at the airport but had no trouble getting in the house and into our room.
I would definitely recommend!![QWERTY123]Laurie's home is beautiful and comfortable. A great place to stay while discovering NYC.[QWERTY123]Laurie is an excellent host.  She provides information for various opportunities in the area from coffee shops and restaurants to museums and theatre.  This is a great location for a visit to Brooklyn, the lovely Park Slope part of Brooklyn, or it is only an easy subway ride to Manhattan.  Laurie's home is warm & welcoming![QWERTY123]Laurie很热情友好,典型的美国家庭!房子很漂亮,特别喜欢每个房间都有很多书,尤其儿童绘本!提供的早晨丰富多样,而且地铁交通很方便,走路5分钟到F,G,R,周边环境安静安全,到展望公园也不远!适合旅游出差和带孩子来旅游的客人!如果再来我还会选择Laurie家!谢谢Laurie提供的一切帮助![QWERTY123]Das Haus von Laurie liegt in einer ruhigen Strasse in einer sicheren Gegend von Brooklyn und ist ein idealer Ort NewYork zu erkunden.Der Garten ist auch toll .D hat biel[QWERTY123]Laurie's place has character and charm, and the garden is a lovely place to enjoy coffee and breakfast. My friend and I stayed in the room with twin beds, which is on the top floor next to the shared bathroom. The space upstairs is, like most living spaces in this neighborhood, quite small. 
	While Laurie is formally welcoming, I felt as if I were clearly sharing her day-to-day living space. When booking here, be aware that the artsy open living space downstairs is not available in the evenings and, although open to access during the day, does not feel like a ""hang out"" space. We did not feel comfortable spending time in any space other than our private room and the garden.
	Finally, our communication with Laurie was very confusing. I found the listing to be highly detailed yet unclear. I wanted to clarify it, but was unable to ask questions before booking, and was actually required to enter all my information in order to communicate at all and “apply” for the room. My application for the reservation was then automatically (and unexpectedly) “accepted,” paid for and subject to her cancellation rules! If you cannot clarify which room you will be booking in advance of payment, do not book here. 
	Warning: two days before our stay, Laurie informed us there was a mix up with double booking another guest. She offered for us to stay in a different listed room, as well as what used to be her son’s room, at first expecting us to pay a small amount for the inconvenience. When we stated we wanted to remain in the room we had booked, she heavily pressured us to wait until arrival and see what else she had to offer. She only backed off and worked it out with the other guest when we threatened to cancel our reservation.[QWERTY123]Very clean, nice neighborhood, really close to a convenient subway line which worked out really well for us.  We had the third floor to ourselves with a clean bathroom stocked with any toiletries we might have forgotten.  Thanks Laurie! Also shoutout to Robin and Batman, they were the friendliest cats we've ever gotten to hang out with.  -Shannon and Sara[QWERTY123]A brilliant apartment in a nice residential area, quick to get to Manhattan or hip Williamsburg. Thanks to Laurie and Maria![QWERTY123]非常好的体验[QWERTY123]Laurie's house is a cosy, comfortable, and safe place in one of New York City's more laid back areas (Park Slope).

For the price Laurie's place is a no-brainer, I think you will be hard-pressed to get better value for your money. The house is situated in the Park Slope area and places of interest such a Prospect Park and the Barclay's Center are easily accessible via public transport and even on foot. The house itself is older but in excellent condition (although those stairs are a bit noisy at night) and it has a beautiful garden with terrace that's great to enjoy a sunny day in.

Laurie is quick and elaborate in responding to any requests or questions I had, on site before my stay and whilst staying with her. Any questions I asked about the area were met with detailed answers and tips for traveling and eating out cheaply. She also gave me overall money saving tips to enjoy as many things as I could in New York. I could tell she has been living in the area for a long time and is both very knowledgeable as well as enthusiastic about conveying that to her guests.

I had a great time staying at Laurie's place as she is an excellent host who really went the extra mile to make my stay as comfortable as possible. This was my first AirBnB experience and it has certainly left a good impression on me as a valid alternative to hotels. I heartily recommend Laurie's place to anyone wanting to visit New York City and/or Park Slope or surrounding areas.[QWERTY123]Close to great restraunts, coffee, breakfast and brunch. Very close to subway. 

Other than all the stairs and the clogged bathtub the apartment was great. Warm and cozy.[QWERTY123]Great, quiet location close to subway. Breakfast is a treat. Room and facilities spacious and clean. A true home away from home![QWERTY123]great convenient recommend without hesitation and laurie is a great host[QWERTY123]Lauries Haus ist ein Boheme Haus voller Bilder und Bücher, cosy und geräumig.  Laurie gibt tolle Tipps, organisiert Taxi zum Flughafen, hat booklet mit insider tipps, also da bleiben keine Fragen offen. Frühstück macht man sich selbst, die Küche ist ausführlich beschriftet und man findet sich gut zurecht. Die Lage in Brooklyn auf der 4. Strasse ist perfekt!!! Ganz toll war, dass Laurie für uns ohne Gebühr die Termine gewechselt hat weil uns Opodo mit englischsprachigem Mitarbeiter falsche Termine gebucht hat. Bucht nie bei englischsprachigem Opodo Mitarbeiter - das ist anderes Land und anderes Unternehmen und ihr habt keine Chance etwas zu reklamieren. Laurie hat uns da gerettet und die Termine angepasst. Das war total nett! Ich würde jederzeit wieder zu Laurie![QWERTY123]The Airbnb was in a great neighborhood with easy access to public transportation. Laurie provided excellent guidance regarding local amenities. The space was clean and well appointed.[QWERTY123]Second time I have stayed at Laurie's.  it is a great placa very conveniently located and easy to arrive to and leave love the freedom to come and go.... and bedding is very comfortable![QWERTY123]You cannot find a better location for visiting Brooklyn and NYC!  Laurie's home is authentic Brooklyn, close to subways, awesome food, Prospect Park, friendly Brookklynites, all that is good about NYC! Yet - the neighborhood is quiet and mellow.    Laurie is welcoming, informative and very accomodating.  The delicious espresso, bagels and cream cheese in the morning -- just the icing on the cake!  Please note, as Laurie states in her post, the bedrooms are on the 3rd floor, so be prepared for the climb up the classic staircase.  It's a great way to assuage guilt after all the rich food you are going to enjoy![QWERTY123]Space was as described. No frills. I was really only there to sleep. It was very comfortable.[QWERTY123]Really enjoyed our stay at Laurie's. The location is great! Close to the subway for easy access to the city, and there are lots of restaurants, shops and cafes in the neighborhood, if you don't want to travel far. The house is lovely. The stairs are steep, as it is an older building, but not too bad. Bed was comfy, sharing a bathroom upstairs was no problem. The garden is gorgeous! Excellent hospitality! Highly recommend![QWERTY123]Great area, cozy room, friendly host! Everything you need![QWERTY123]Laurie's home was absolutely amazing. The common area was the perfect place for me to go through emails and enjoy the complimentary bagel breakfast. Everything  was very clean and comfortable, I easily  could have moved in!! Can't wait to come back.[QWERTY123]Staying at Laurie's home was delightful. The house and garden is beautiful and Laurie was an excellent host.[QWERTY123]Great location in Brooklyn, easy access to subways and busses.[QWERTY123]The house is very charming. Laurie gave us a lot of information about Manhattan and Brooklyn. The other guests were very nice. We liked sharing breakfast with them in the kitchen. We recommend this place![QWERTY123]Clean, comfortable, convenient, quiet with great coffee.  I enjoyed my stay.  I strongly recommend it.[QWERTY123]it’s a very good choice for visitors who wants to experience NY for a few days. nice location.[QWERTY123]Laurie is a lovely hostess. She knows the area and has great suggestions for things to do and places to go. Her home is walking distance from local stores, shops, restaurants, the local gym, and the subway. So, getting around from her place was awesome. She offered fresh fruit for morning snacks which we enjoyed. The bed was comfortable, our room and bathroom was clean. Our room was 2 flights up but we are in good shape and didn't mind the stairs. Her home is in a great location! Lovely hostess, lovely place to stay!"	40.668692535142085	-73.98779831181402	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/10962	2	89.0	1.0
80	23686	"Great location. Thankfully we were only two people...the third bedroom more of a wine cellar than bedroom. Overall experience was fine.[QWERTY123]Ann's townhouse is ideally located, the neighborhood is fantastic ! The house is very lovely and unusual (we loved it) , but not super practical for a family of four. 
Ann is a sweet and responsible host and was quick to respond to the problems we had during our stay.
Now the downsides:
- The tiny room probably should not be used to sleep in (size, heavy condensation and very scalding heating adjacent to the bed).
The dryer was broken when we arrrived (Ann replaced it very quickly), as was the lock to the patio
- During spring and summer, for those on vacation, just be aware there is a lot to do in the house: 2 small gardens to water 1 on roof, cats to feed and keep safe...
- Ann needed to come over a lot during our 2 week stay - every 3 days approx, which we are not used to when we rent via air bnb - but always tried to warn us in advance
That being said, we would happily stay in Ann's house again, its a great place as long as you know the shorcomings and she is a good and friendly host.[QWERTY123]Cuéntales a los demás miembros de la comunidad Airbnb qué tal fue tu estancia.[QWERTY123]Ann's house is definitely not a good address: Too much expensive for what it is . if the pictures are real, they don't tell the whole truth.
The worst thinh : a strong , bad smell from cats in all the house ( sofa, cushions, rugs, carpets , even the wood floor). As previous guests complained about it, it took me everyday 20 minutes to feed the cats and water the plants. The third room has no  real window and it 's becoming so  humid when it rains than you can't stay inside. Not a single hanger for your cloths :you will have to keep them in your suitcase because the wardrobes are full with Ann' stuff.
No regular  dishes so uou 're asked to wash them by hand and not to use the dishwasher ! Concerning the so called precious chair  ... It has been broken before and repaired with glue and metal collars so when it broke again I refused to be charged for something I did,'t make. ""ANN wishes to have her cake and eat it too"" : she rents her house, takes the money but nothing is done for the guests.[QWERTY123]Ann's house is super cool. My wife and 2 daughters 12 and 10 stayed there for almost a week. I doubt this area can be beaten, so many great restaurants and cheap eats around, and some good little bars nearby. And anyone who has rented a hotel room in NYC will agree that the value for money here is pretty good. There are many other positives to this place; close to subways, safe at night, Washington square park, monster sound system set up with spotify ready to go, the cats are friendly and liked hanging out with us, and despite the nearby bars it's not noisy in the house at night. 
A couple of minor negatives. When we arrived the previous guest was still there, not even packed to leave, so we had to hang in the park for a couple of hours while she got her stuff together and the housekeeper Silvana (great person) did her thing. We got over this pretty quick though, it was no biggie in the scheme of things. And lastly Ann had to drop in a few times while we were there to pick up various bits n pieces. She had however just returned home from overseas.
To end on a positive I think we should bear in mind that when we use airbnb we are not booking a hotel, so you have to compromise on a few of the quirks of places and hosts. There are hardly any hotels in this area so places such as Ann's give us users a chance to live like a local in West Village, and this is a great unusual house in a friendly cool town.[QWERTY123]The reservation was canceled 26 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.[QWERTY123]We enjoyed our stay very much, its a very special house very original and it suited us very well. The location is excellent, the neighbourhood fantastic and of course Ann was very helpful and accommodating from the second we arrived. A lovely experience we no doubt will repeat with every future trip to NYC... Thank you[QWERTY123]Ann is great! Communicates well and quickly responded to all my questions. Thank you so much ~ your townhouse is an absolute delight![QWERTY123]Beautiful home, just as described.  We stayed with our 2 kids ages 10 and 6, and they loved feeding the cats.  Ann was extremely responsive and we will gladly stay here again on our next visit to NYC![QWERTY123]This was an absolutely amazing experience. We stayed in NY in 2007 but in a hotel so this was a completely different experience and one I would highly recommend. 
Ann made us feel very welcome in her beautiful home. The communication between us arriving and whilst staying in Ann's townhouse was brilliant. Fast, polite and full of tips for us (where to eat etc). 
The area in my opinion was just perfect. Greenwich Village is a gem and away from the hustle and bustle of the tourist areas which we wanted. I feel this was a authentic NY trip.
Thanks Ann for your hospitality during our stay in your home. We have truly enjoyed our trip and will certainly recommend people to stay with you in the future. We for sure would return with no hesitation.[QWERTY123]I rented the house only for the day -- I am a stylist and did a photoshoot here. The house itself is perfect -- very worldly decorated --- I loved looking at all of the artwork. The layout of the house is nice for having multiple people in the house -- each upper floor had its own bedroom. You can't beat the full windowed wall/ceiling that looks out into the back yard -- I've never seen anything like in NYC. 

With a beautiful house comes a lot of peculiarities ... a broken chair that was propped in a sitting area, a door mat that was not supposed to get dirty,  a room that was unusable even though we rented the whole house, BUT overall the experience was worth it. The location is great -- we even snagged free all day parking on the street! A really beautiful house in a great location ..[QWERTY123]Beautiful, quiet, and quaint block in West Village. Home even more amazing in person. Carefully curated and beautifully decorated, Ann's home is a dream. Ann was a great host.[QWERTY123]This is a wonderful house in a fantastic location. From the street you walk straight in to the sitting room - but you are immediately drawn to the balcony alongside the huge airy, atrium of the kitchen/dining room which is where you'll want to spend all your time - and along to the back garden for sitting out in the sunshine.
In the kitchen there is a gas hob/electric oven Aga, with a great range of cast iron pans, dishwasher, washing machine and dryer. And a long sociable dining table under the great windows for breakfasts and talking into the night.
The first floor bedroom is the most spacious, and has its own shower/toilet. Up the spiral wooden stairs to the second floor and an open plan single bedroom in a room lined with books, and the spacious bathroom with shower and fabulous zinc bath. Wind around the stairs again and you get to the attic double bedroom, with skylights and clever metal shutters, and an enticing ladder to take you to the roof garden. Magical, secluded and very special.
The streets around are full of great restaurants, breakfast spots, delis and pubs. The IFC cinema is two minutes away, as is the 4th Street subway. Perfect.[QWERTY123]Had some trouble communicating with Ann at first. She seemed surprised that we did not want the place still being cleaned after we got there, though our arrival time was already two hours later (approx 3PM) than the time she had indicated in her write-up (1PM). Once things calmed down, the place worked out well. It’s very distinctive and in a desirable Manhattan neighborhood. Very special place—perhaps not the best fit for the very fastidious or those looking for a luxe experience, a little funky in the old sense of funky; but it worked for us and we would definitely consider renting again.[QWERTY123]We traveled to New York last week for seven days and stayed at Ann’s house. Here is our experience:

Pros: 
1)The house is centrally located. It’s a few minutes walk to two different subway stations with multiple lines. 
2)     The neighborhood is fantastic for food, coffee and shopping.
3)Ann provided a discount for a weeklong stay and our willingness to take a good care of her two cats.
4)There were four of us. It’s nice to stay in a house feeling as if we were at home. 

Cons: 
1)The main bedroom had a faint smell of cat’s pee. 
2)There are twos bars adjacent and across from the house. Unfortunately, you can hear people clearly to the wee hours of the morning if you stay in Red Room or Library. 
3)Ann has a lot of stuff everywhere in the house.  Quite cluttered.  There’s no closet space to hang our clothes – we need to use standalone clothes hooks.
4)  When we arrived Newark airport, I called and texted Ann multiple times but she didn’t answer. Eventually she responded to my text. We got to the house, and we had to wait for her for twenty minutes.  

Ann told us that a maid would be there at 12 noon to clean the house the day we left, so we left five or six used glasses in the kitchen. The next day I received a message from Ann complaining that it was very unpleasant for her to put them into the dishwasher. 

We also had a few faux pas during the stay. One garbage day we put our bag in front of the wrong side of the house – the side of Ann’s neighbor’s.  We didn’t sort our recycles properly.  We also didn’t turn off the coffee machine properly that Ann had to reset it to make it work.  A lesson learned is that we need to be more careful for future stays. 
[QWERTY123]Ann was the most gracious host. She is truly a kind person and her place is even more magical than the photos. Her home is a rare gem. You can't beat the location, especially if you are a real foodie! Very close to public transportation. Ann's cats are very gentle and well behaved. I highly recommend renting this incredible NYC home![QWERTY123]The house is a unique design which we all loved. The location is perfect for a visit to New York. We walked to the Empire State Building one day and visited Smalls jazz club a 5 minute walk away. We would recommend it to others.[QWERTY123]Ann was very welcoming, the house is very much as described, lot's of charm, very well decorated. The area is amazing, lots of good food, good shops, etc...[QWERTY123]Ann was there to welcome us and we really appreciated her flexibility as our flight was an our early. The house is as quirky and fun as described, brilliantly located and very relaxing to stay in.  We felt immediately at home and really enjoyed getting to know the neighbourhood. It's an ideal place to stay to make you feel like a New Yorker, not suitable for less mobile people (stairs) or small children, but fantastic for active adults with a sense of curiosity and a desire to explore.[QWERTY123]La maison est très bien située et a du charme. Tout est malheureusement un peu encombré. L'air conditionné ne fonctionnait pas dans le salon cuisine ce qui a rendu le séjour inconfortable en juillet.[QWERTY123]Ann was very understanding and welcoming, given our later than planned arrival (allow 2 hours to clear JFK)
The location was everything that we wished for; safe, great shops and restaurants. Vibrant. No feeling of being hemmed in, compared to uptown.
What a house with history.!
Ann's Airbnb description was accurate, the fantastic spiral staircase is steep but we had no problems negotiating this.
The bedrooms were comfortable and our daughter loved sleeping surrounded by books.
The cats were well behaved and even deigned to be petted at times.[QWERTY123]LOCATION, LOCATION, LOCATION--this is a darling, old fashioned home that is in the middle of the best neighborhood for walking and window-shopping and eating great food.  The house is like an antique that has been lovingly maintained, and filled with antiques both from the US and other countries.   The beds are comfortable and there is a great bathroom with a large old-fashioned tub.  There is a small circular stairway that is a bit hard to navigate with large suitcases, especially up to the 4th floor.  There isn't much room for suitcases and clothes, but it is adequate.  We were a family with two teenagers and we had enough room, but there isn't a lot of extra space.  The TV is in one of the bedrooms, which made it a bit hard to watch when we saw a movie one night.

Ann was lovely and very responsive.  She met us at the house and explained everything thoroughly.  No difficulties.  All in all a lovely home in a fabulous location.
[QWERTY123]4 of us stayed here for 5 days in December and we couldn't have a scored a cooler place to hangout.

Location: Perfect, walking distance from amazing bars, cafes, pizza joints, great atmosphere on the street. Even caught some celebrities around the neighbourhood, (Lionel Richie and Michael Moore)

House: was beautiful, filled with books, 2 very low admin cats, beautiful art and more space than i expected from a NYC apartment as we had all 4.5 floors. The house was quite pokey and had a lot of things everywhere (tidy but full) which was not a problem for us, and we were four average to quite tall guys. It was definitely a lived in house full of character so a great place for someone wanting something more interesting than an empty made-for-purpose airbnb. 

Host: Ann couldn't have been better, communication was quick and effective from requesting the house to checking out. She also went the extra mile showing us around, providing a key for each guest and even making two trips to let in our whole group over two days due to changes in our plans.

Unfortunately we were not ideal guests, forgetting to put the rubbish out and misplacing a key.

Thanks Ann, we'll be back[QWERTY123]Our stay was amazing! Ann is such a wonderful host, very nice and welcoming. The house is exactly as described and the design is unique and fun. We loved the library bedroom and the beds are so comfortable. The two cats are absolutely adorable and caused no trouble at all. We honestly loved everything about this place especially its location. It is in a safe neighborhood and has many great restaurants and shops nearby.[QWERTY123]We spent five nights in Ann's charming and spacious town house. Great location, comfortable beds, fully eqipped and two lovely cats to keep us company.

The only downside was that we had not beforehand spotted that one bedroom wasn't quite private, as there were windows in it and there was no bedroom door.

All in all a great place to stay in![QWERTY123]We loved staying at Anns house, so many highlights - the lovely cats, great location, great artwork and books, fabulous light dining room!
A real treat, hope to be back soon.[QWERTY123]L'appartement est tres encombré, pas de place dans les placards. Les chambres n'ont pas des portes et les chats visitent. Forte odeur de chat. 
Mais Ann est charmante et était desolee par notre depart precipité[QWERTY123]The stay was amazing as last time. Ann has been an amazing host since day one. The house is clean, unique and at a great location. I had so much fun shopping in Soho and visiting nearby museums with friends. The two cats Mashia and Lulu are absolutely adorable and I miss them already. It is just a fantastic place to stay in. Thanks so much Ann.[QWERTY123]This beautiful and eclectic home was well located, clean and very interesting. A group of four friends had a great weekend here. It’s close to bars, restaurants, and all lower Manhattan attractions. The host was fantastic, and she provided every convenience that we could have asked for.[QWERTY123]We had a amazing time at Ann's house. There is no better location for soaking in the West Village. Murray's Cheese Shop, Faicco's Italian Market, John's Pizza--all beloved Village institutions--are right around the corner on Bleeker St. Her house is super cool, the cats are sweet, and we look forward to coming back when spring comes to enjoy her outdoor space. Ann is super communicative and was a fantastic host. Loved our stay and you will too.[QWERTY123]Lovely and charming house with the best location in NYC![QWERTY123]The place is just amazing, it’s everything it looks from the pictures and more. Books, art, and every detail full of good taste. We enjoyed our stay very much.[QWERTY123]Very cool home with lots of unique features. Great area, quiet and safe. Could even sleep with the windows open which helped on those hot summer nights. Ann was a great host, very communicative. We really enjoyed our stay and loved taking care of the two cats.[QWERTY123]This was a dream home to stay in during my visit to NYC! Everything was so wonderfully eclectic and reminded me of my old apartment in the West Village. It was close to everyone and everything I wanted to see during my stay. The home was super clean and the rain shower was phenomenal. Doing things like watering the plants and feeding the cute cats was so much better than any hotel amenity. Ann and Liz were very quick to respond to any inquiry and were very accommodating.  If there was a way to give ten stars instead of just five I would. Best visit back home to NYC yet![QWERTY123]Must be able to do stairs, but of course in NYC one must be prepared to walk and be flexible.[QWERTY123]Anyone who is fortunate enough to get an invite to Ann's place will be pleasantly be surprised to find a fabulous HOME that could never be replicated with internet pictures. If you like staying in a place that makes you feel like you're LIVING in a place, then Ann's house is the spot to be! I love plants, wood, stone, wool and stainless and the surroundings fit my ideal. You won't be sorry that you made the choice but only sorry that the dates you want might be already booked!![QWERTY123]Unique home with character and function in a desirable West Village location. We'd love to visit again as a home base when exploring NYC. Ann is quick to reply to questions. Her cats are friendly and so easy to care for![QWERTY123]The house and location were great!  Ann was incredibly responsive and the cats were very friendly.  We would stay there again or recommend it to a friend.[QWERTY123]Cool & quirky home conveniently located within minutes of everything one could possibly need in NYC.  Really need a month to take in all the details of this very personal bohemian style place. Perhaps not ideal if narrow or steepish stairs would be off-putting but Ann is very transparent as to the pros and cons of this terrace and so there should only be pleasant surprises. 
Having kitties curl up  one's bed made it a true home away from home experience!"	40.730963366416134	-74.00319303967215	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/23686	5	500.0	0.924667
81	24143	"Seth was so great! Not only was he a caring and sweet host (always checking if I'm doing ok), but he was also fun and very friendly dude. I just moved to the city and he was very helpful with the apt hunt and even took me out with his friends for some beers and laughs. I just has a great time hanging out with him. Seth, you better keep in touch! I know where you live now! -I absolutely recommend him, and for future guests: ask him how to peel a mango! You report back to me. ha![QWERTY123]Great location and amazing loft full of entertainment! Extremely close to the subway station (L Train). Seth is a smart, easy going fellow.

Excellent value, I'd stay there again.[QWERTY123]Seth was very helpful and hospitable! i felt  quite comfortable at his apartment. I recommend for anyone to stay with him! Luckily, i know the area pretty well but Seth was willing to give directions, suggestions, etc.[QWERTY123]Great place and location.  The rooftop deck is a nice perk.  Ridiculously close to the L train, GTs.  Highly recommended.[QWERTY123]Seth's place is A-M-A-Z-I-N-G !!!!
Very stylish, spacious, and the views we can get from there is unbelievable!
Also, the bed was surprisingly very comfy :D
And Seth was very nice and easy-going.
The L train station is like 2 seconds away from the apartment, and it takes you to Union Sq-14th st very quickly, from where you can get to almost everywhere in Manhattan.
Plus, if you want to go directly to LES, you can walk a little bit to the J train station on Lorimer st and it gets you near Ludlow St super fast.

Thanks Seth! I'll definitely be back! And you're always welcome in Lyon! :)[QWERTY123]Seth was all I hoped for as a host. Accommodating, kind, helpful with any questions my friend and I would have, also made great suggestions about where to go and things to do. The room was a decent size and the bed was really comfortable. His place is extremely well located, literally around the corner to the L line and minutes away from Manhattan. Seth gave my friend a tour of Brooklyn when she first arrived and I felt extremely lucky to get invited to some amazing social events. Feel like I've made a great friend. I would highly recommend Seth and his place.[QWERTY123]Seth was a good host and his apartment is nice. Proximity to the ""L"" train into Manhattan is a plus.
Recommended.[QWERTY123]Seth is a really nice and helpful guy with many things to share. The apartment is great and the location is awesome: ten steps from the L subway to Manhattan, 15min walking to Bedford Ave. I should and I will stay there again!

[QWERTY123]Seth was the most fantastic host!  We really enjoyed staying at his place.  Seth's apartment is gorgeous and we were extremely comfortable there.  Seth is also an incredibly gracious host - he was so kind and made us espresso in the morning and even picked up bagels.  I would highly recommend staying with Seth the next time your travels take you to NY.[QWERTY123]Seth was an amazingly graceful host -- his place was clean, the room was spacious, and he was a great conversationalist for the 10 minutes a day I saw him (we both work incessantly). 

His home's proximity to the L train is fantastic. I could make it to midtown manhattan in less than 30 minutes. I was in town to meet investors and customers, and was able to squeeze in a few extra meetings because I could get around so easily. 

Seth went out of his way to introduce me to new friends, which made a boring trip to NY especially memorable. 

If you love Tommy, check out his pinball machine. 

Furthermore,  his bed has a Tempur-Pedic layer. Best sleep I've gotten while travelling outside the W.[QWERTY123]Seth has a lovely place and is a very kind host.  I only wish I had realized that his place has no lift. The pictures and modern looking building made me think there would be an elevator, and I forgot to check under amenities.  Four flights is challenging with too much luggage.  I would highly recommend staying with Seth if you aren't schlepping three pieces of luggage.  Next time I stay I'll pack less.  The tempur pedic pad on the bed makes it truly comfortable, and the rainfall showerhead makes you feel like you are living in luxury.  Both of the Airbnb places I've stayed in Brooklyn have had outstanding showers with great water pressure.  It makes me think Brooklyn's the place to stay!
I just wish I hadn't been getting over jetlag and a cold, so that I could have attempted to play pinball or enjoyed Williamsburg more.  I can recommend Lite Bites for breakfast.  Seth is great at suggesting places to find eats, but I hope at some point he'll put together a mini-guide to his neighborhood.  He does make NYC guidebooks available, and the guest room has a TV and DVD player.[QWERTY123]Seth is great! I stayed at his place twice and highly recommend it! He's respectful and let you very comfortable. Staying at Seth's is like being home.[QWERTY123]I have had a very good time at Seth's home. He is very confident, kind, easy going and welcoming which makes you feel really at ease at his place. He is also really helpful and willing to give tips and good places to go in Manhattan and Brooklyn which I appreciated a lot. 
Seth's apartment is pleasant, calm, ideally located in a safe area. A subway station is only a few steps and takes you in the center of Manhattan within 10/15 minutes only. You can also be in the lively and nice areas of Williamsburg (around Bedford and Metropolitan Avenues) within a short time (5 minutes subway or 15/20 minutes walking).  which are as valuable as Manhattan and definitely deserve to be explored !
Thank you again Seth for your welcome as you contributed to make my stay in New York a real good time ! 

[QWERTY123]Nice guy and great setup! No joke about how convenient this place is from Manhattan -- the L zips you into 14th St. in about ten minutes.

[QWERTY123]Seth was at work when I arrived to his appartment. He contacted me to make sure everything was alright and suggested me a restaurant in the area. His lovely appartment is well located. It takes 2 minutes to get to the L train.
Highly recommended. Voilà![QWERTY123]The place was perfect! And Seth was an incredibly helpful host - out of the country for most of our stay and still responding to questions and inquiries through email. Great guy, great place. Cozy, and very convenient for getting around the city. 
Thanks Seth![QWERTY123]Seth was at work when we arrived to his apartment but he left a key for us and the virtual doorman was really helpful. His apartment was in a great location-just one minute away from the subway and in ten minutes we were in Manhattan. Seth let us do laundry and always offered help if we needed anything at all. I wish we could have had more time with him as he is a really great guy with a very interesting life! He gave us a cellphone to use which was a very big help when it came to getting around the city! 

I would recommend Seth's place to anyone and he knows if he ever needs a place in Spain, there's a room waiting for him here! 

Thanks for everything!!! 

Cynthia and Joan[QWERTY123]Nice, trendy and stylish. Seth's place likes my dream home exactly. Would strongly recommend my friends to stay behind in his place.[QWERTY123]Seth's place was great and an awesome location, around the corner from the L train.  He was more than happy to help with any questions/suggestions we had about the area during our stay and a very nice guy.  I would definitely recommend him for those looking to stay in Williamsburg.[QWERTY123]Staying at Seth's was great! Seth is a super nice guy and has a fantastic apartment, complete with the most comfortable bed, EVER. Apartment is right around the corner from the L train, and it was really quick to get into Manhattan. Highly recommended. Thanks for the stay, Seth!


[QWERTY123]Get stay! Looks just like the pictures. Seth gives you your space. Best part is it's right off the L. Thanks Seth![QWERTY123]I stayed with seth for 3weeks and it was great! My first time in NYC and I had the priveledge of staying in this luxurius apartment. 
Really nice and safe neighbourhood, 2 min walk to the L train, which will take you to Union Square Manhattan in like 10 min.

Seth is a really nice guy, he actually invited me to a party the first night I arrived in NYC. What a welcome! The room is large, comfy and the bed is perfect. It is hard to get up in the morning:)

The next time when I am in NYC I will definitly want to stay here again.

Seth thanks for everything!

Sanela[QWERTY123]Area is actually good. All is like in pictures. Having all diff.tools and things in the ""crib"" so if weather is bad and you are not going anywhere, it is fine to stay in.
Bad that we did not meet Seth, maybe next time.
All was good and easy - cause there is only one rule - no shoes in apartment!  ;)[QWERTY123]Unfortunately Seth was away during my stay but a friend of his was here to welcome me and make me feel at home. We ended up having dinners, going out and checking an exhibit together, she was great fun.
The apartment is fantastic, a true gem - you can see Seth put a lot of effort into it. Location is great, too, just a few steps from the L train to take you into Manhattan - the train was down that weekend so they had shuttle services... That's NY for you! Lots of shops around, and a great area to walk around to have a great feel of what NY really is.
Other perks are a great shower and one of the most comfortable beds I've ever slept in - so much so that I never managed to get an early start!
Definitely a great first experience on AirBnb![QWERTY123]Really great location, safe for a woman traveling on her own! 

Apartment like the pictures, although I didn't venture onto the balcony as you need to go through Seth's bedroom, and I felt a little like I would be intruding. 

Only issue for people planning to shop a lot is that there is no lift, and you need to carry your suitcase up and down lots of stairs. 

Other than that, lovely helpful host, and a great price for the stay! 

Would recommend to people on a budget.

Thanks Seth! x

[QWERTY123]Apartment is very nice, modern and clean, situated just 15 minutes from Manhattan if you use subway which is just few steps from the building. It was very convinient for me as I spent all the days walking in Manhattan and didn't loose much time for getting there. I can't help admiring the bed, of course, the mattress is fantastic. :) 
Seth is a great host, helpful and tactful. The special thanks to him for helping me cope with my heavy trunk :) Cell phone he gave me for all my staying in NYC was also a great bonus!
I had a very good time and I would love to stay there again during my next trip to NYC! 
[QWERTY123]Staying with Seth was a highlight of my NYC experience this year.  A friend and I stayed for a week, half the time in a hotel, and half the time through AirBnB with Seth.  This was my first time using AirBnB and I will admit I was slightly sketched about staying in someone else's home.  Now, I can't stop recommending my experience due the the value, comfot, and kindness provided by my host.  
In many ways I think staying with Seth was much better than my hotel experience, and I encourage anyone on the fence about trying this service to pull the trigger because I couldn't be happier about it. Seth is also considerate enough to give you your own space, but when we asked him to meet us for a drink, he totally came through! One night he even drew us a map of places we should check out.  Great host.[QWERTY123]We had three great nights at Seth's place. He's the best host ever, serving us with a US phone and giving us all the advises we needed. The location is great if you want to enjoy both Brooklyn and NY.[QWERTY123]Seth was a great host, welcoming and very helpful. The place is nice and I also enjoyed the neighborhood a lot. Strongly recommended.[QWERTY123]My girlfriend and I stayed at Seth's for four nights and had a great time. The apartment is exactly as you see in the pictures - nice and spacious with all mod cons (plus one or two extras like the pinball machine).
Seth was a great host, there to help if needed, but always respectful of our privacy. The fact that he let us have a state-of-the-art mobile phone for the duration of our stay was a real bonus too.[QWERTY123]So if I ever move to NYC I would love to have a housemate like Seth! He's fun, got a great sence of style and super helpful. And even though I know he has a busy schedule he still found time to take me out and show me around. Come to Australia and I would be more than happy to return the favor. Thanks Seth![QWERTY123]My time at Seth's was great. The place is extremely well-kept, clean, and generally very cool! 

I didn't see him all too much as both of our schedules were conflicting - but he was extremely helpful with tips and places to go! We stayed in touch predominantly via email when asking where to eat and what to see. His response was always prompt, and extremely appreciated. The room I stayed in was great, with a massive TV hooked up to Netflix -which is always a good thing!

The area itself is nice, with taxi services available near, and walking distance from the subway. The only thing I would say in regards to staying at Seth's is try to pack light. As his apartment is up four flights, in a complex without an elevator, it can sometimes be a struggle when lugging suitcases the same size as you!

Overall, Seth is a great host - even when he's not there - and I would greatly recommend staying at his. Made the whole experience of visiting NY that much better![QWERTY123]We had a great couple of days at Seth's – he was very accommodating, very helpful and very knowledgeable about the local area. His place is great, and you get a real feeling of privacy while knowing that Seth is always on hand to help in any way. The phone he lent us was a life-saver too – we'd probably still be lost in Manhattan to this day if it wasn't for being able to use the maps on it!

We'd definitely stay with Seth again, and would happily recommend him to anyone.[QWERTY123]We stayed with Seth for 9 days and it was great. The apartment is very nice and clean and it's location in the heart of Williamsburg was great for us. It's only a 3 minute walk to the Subway that takes your right into Manhattan and walking to the bars and restaurants of Williamsburg was easy and safe, even at night. 
As we were out most of the time we didn't get to use the kitchen or roof terrace a lot, but still it's great to have the opportunity to prepare your own food if you want to. As Seth was out most of the time, too, we didn't have any trouble sharing the bathroom with him (no queues in the morning as you know it from other shared places). The room had a good size even though we had a lot of luggage flying around and the bed was very comfy. Seth is very friendly and easy going and was happy to give us suggestions about places to see or to show us his favourite bars. All in all, it was much better than staying in an overpriced NY hotel.[QWERTY123]Seth was a great host, the place is locating in a good spot, and you'll have your own private bedroom with a great view of manhattan in the distance.[QWERTY123]Seth's place was everything I needed — a private, cosy room, in an interesting neighbourhood to explore and really close to public transport. Not knowing New York at all, the L was a really useful and easy train line to be near, and it was great being in Brooklyn but also feeling so close to the East and West Village. Seth was really friendly and accommodating, and the phone he lent me was a bonus too.[QWERTY123]Seth was a great host - totally welcoming and down to earth. The location of the apartment is *great* - so close to the subway and great restaurants and bars. Room was adorable and cozy, so bright and airy, and I thoroughly enjoyed my stay. The phone is an amazing bonus of this place![QWERTY123]Great apartment! Great location! Extremely comfortable bedroom and amenities throughout the clean modern apartment. Seth is lovely, very easy to communicate with and generous with offering information about the local area. The complimentary phone Seth provided during my stay was a godsend! For this rate, you'd be hard pressed to find a better place to stay in New York, and the Williamsburg neighbourhood is fantastic. The super convenient L train is located 1 minute from the front door and gets you to Manhattan in under 10 minutes.
I can't recommend Seth's place highly enough![QWERTY123]My time in New York was amazing and much of this was due to the fact that I had a great host in Seth and a great place, in his apartment, to call my home away from home.  I wouldn't call Seth my host anymore, he has now become my friend!

In regards to ""getting around"", the L train is just a hop, skip and a jump away which made getting around very, very easy!  

Seth was also always on hand to answer any questions I may have had.  

As a first time user of Airbnb, the experience was awesome and I will now use it as my first port of call when booking accommodation overseas.  

Seth, thank you for opening your home to me, I had a great time.  Your roof top terrace was an absolute luxury! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!

[QWERTY123]I had a great stay at Seth's place.  Great host very friendly, and gave us some great party tips.[QWERTY123]Seth and his girlfriend were wonderful hosts, made us feel very welcome and even provided toothpaste, shampoos and a skin cream! Seth's Netflix TV set up is awesome, especially after a long day of walking around in NYC. The balcony view is great, particularly at night and the subway is very close by. Seth gave us an extensive list of cool places to eat and drink. We managed to try out a couple and we were not disappointed. All in all we had a very comfortable stay and would definitely recommend Seth's place if you are visiting New York City.[QWERTY123]Our stay at Seth started in pretty untypical fashion. We arrived during Hurricane Irene. We had to change our travel plans at the last minute but luckily for us Seth was very reactive and we arranged to arrive one day early. That literally saved our holidays! We even had dinner prepared for us which was very kind of Seth and his girlfriend.

The flat is very close to a subway which takes you to Manhattan within minutes. There are also some nice restaurants and bars around which Seth recommended to us. The room itself has a giant TV screen with free 
video on demand (which was nice to have as we were stuck indoors 
during the hurricane). We did not use the terrace as we did not want to 
intrude in Seth's room and were out most of the time anyway. 

Also Seth gave us a US mobile phone for the time of our stay and that was very useful as we could use the maps to navigate through NYC without getting lost. It was also useful to check out reviews on 
restaurants and to make reservations.
[QWERTY123]Seth is really friendly and maybe we were just unlucky but I would not recommend this place, at least not for a couple looking for a comfortable bed, crisp sheets and clean bathroom.... There was a doble booking when we arrived but Seth graciously reimbursed us for that night so that wasn't the problem. Also, the views are nice, the TV-film watching option is good, there's a great coffeeshop around the corner and the L train close and Brooklyn is interesting to explore, but when we were there, our room was cluttered (not crisp and tidy like in the photo), the sheets did not smell clean, there were no towels when we arrived and the bathroom was dirty and cluttered. We felt like we were really intruding in someone else's household. Most importantly though, the bed is small for 2 and the mattress was not a proper matress (but some plastic filling which also makes a lot of noise) and we found it extremely uncomfortable and left with a back ache. All in all, probabl great if you feel like couch surfing and chatting a lot with a host, but compared to our other AirBnb experience in NYC, a dissapointment.[QWERTY123]I stayed with Seth and his Girlfriend for a couple nights in September, and it was everything I expected in an airbnb stay, and more. The pictures are accurate - Seth actually does live in a huge loft in the middle of Williamsburg with all that beautiful furniture. The room you get to call yours, actually does have that view of Manhattan (which is only 4 stops away on the L-train, 15 minutes max, including a 1 minute walk to the station). Seth and his girlfriend were very friendly and although I spent some time watching TV in my room alone after a long day in the city, I am sure they would have welcomed me with open arms if I wanted to watch TV with them in the living room. I must admit the washroom was a bit messier than I would have liked, but the rain shower in the morning totally made up for it. The next time I am in NYC, you know where I'll be staying![QWERTY123]Seth was a great host and the apartment looks just like the pictures : spacious and designer ! You can even play to a real pinball if you wish, so awesome ;-) And the terrace is really great, however, you can only access it through Seth’s room…

As promised, Seth lent us a mobile phone for free,  which was very useful to contact friends in the US and find places to visit thanks to the map. He also gave us tips about nearby bars and restaurants, so nice to him ! 

So we really enjoyed our stay in Seth’s place which is so close to the Subway and well located in Williamsburg. Thanks again ![QWERTY123]If you're looking for a really nice place to stay in NYC, then do not hesitate : you should definitely stay in this apartment ! Seth and his girlfriend were amazing hosts : they were friendly and made us feel comfortable. Communication (before and during the stay) was excellent. One of the best things about Seth's apartment is that it's close to the subway, just around the block. It's literally a 2 minute walk, going to Manhattan couldn't be easier. The apartment was clean and beautiful, just like the pictures. The bed was comfortable, and the bathroom was close to the bedroom, which was convenient. Seth's bedroom is upstairs, so you'll have full privacy. Also, the american cellphone he lent us for the stay was a real bonus : we could have access to the Internet and maps. To conclude : wonderful hosts, great location and cool apartment ! Just stay in Seth's place, you won't be disappointed. This was our first Airbnb experience, and we couldn't hoped for better ![QWERTY123]Seth was a wonderful host!
He's a kind and helpful person, provided us with every kind of useful information about the city and  the mobile phone that he give us for the duration of our stay was a real bonus too! The house was clean, the room spacious and the metro station is just around the corner.
We would definitely recommend Seth's place if you are visiting New York City.
[QWERTY123]Seth was a great host. He gave us real New Yorker inside information on great places to eat, drink and have fun, instead of falling into the usual tourist traps. And with the phone he lend us we were able to traverse the city with no problems.

The room was spacious, filled with light, a great view of the skyline and with all the media entertainment one could dream of for a slow night at home :) 

All that mixed with the short trip to the subway, makes Seth's place the place to stay if using bed and breakfast.[QWERTY123]Seth was a great host and made it really easy for me friend and I to have a nice, safe place to stay while in NY. It was especially nice that we could just come and go as we wanted it, without having to fit into Seth's plans. We had a great time and I really recommend Seths apartment for a nice nonexpencive time in NYC![QWERTY123]Seriously THE best host ever. He is super helpful, friendly and just the coolest host. I would definitely stay with Seth again and am planning on doing so in the future! 

The place is also what is looks like and more, from the gizmo's like Netflix service - which came in really handy on the blizzard day, to the actual location of the place. Bars, restaurants and everything else by your doorstep.

It felt like being home away from home.

See you again Seth :)
[QWERTY123]We had an amazing week at Seth. Everything was as expected and we would definitely recommend his place.
Seth was very friendly and available. He gave us lots of information and tips about Manhattan and his area in brooklyn ( restaurants, bars, ...)
His place is so close to the tube station with a direct line to manhattan, which is very convenient. He also lend us a phone and lots of tourist guides and maps to go around the city.
We loved the experience and will defintely go back to Seth's place if going back to NYC.[QWERTY123]We had a great stay at Seth's. He and his girlfriend and amazingly friendly and helpful. She even called a doctor for me when I got sick. It was really nice ! The distance from Seth's apartment to the subway is literally 2 mins and this is very convenient!  It is also a great advantage that we could have a phone with free internet and calls within the US. The apartment is really cool and the room is light with a really high ceiling. You also have access to all movies and tv series via Seth's Gizmo subscription which is great for rainy days. The only one thing we were a bit disappointed about was the fact that neither bathroom nor kitchen were cleaned before we arrived. This was a bit ""unwelcoming"" first impression and it takes away one star from our rating, but all in all, we can highly recommend this cool flat on East WIlliamsburg and its friendly hosts! Thank you once again guys :-) M&B[QWERTY123]Seth was a wonderful host: accommodating, easy, communicative, generous, laid back, and interesting. The room was comfortable and the loft itself was really well done, modern with great amenities. It is super close to the L train (though, that line proved to be tricky) and Seth was quick to give advice about getting around.

Definitely would recommend this place to anybody– couples, singles, and stays long and short.[QWERTY123]What a great stay! Seth and his girlfriend Ray are lovely and generous people and great hosts. Seth was excellent at communicating with me all the details about the place. It was all very simple. The place is really nice, with a nice shower, particularly if you are tall (like me). Great neighborhood, really trendy. The TV with Netflix and Hulu was great to veg out after long days of walking New York and the phone is incredibly useful, particularly for maps. This place began to feel like a home away from home. My first Air bnb experience and I would recommend it to everyone.[QWERTY123]What a gorgeous apartment & in a quiet neighborhood too! Just 1 minute walk to the l train . Seth also let us use his mobile phone during our stay which was an added bonus ! Wish I could have stayed longer in Williamsburg & in this appartment[QWERTY123]Just excellent and exactly what we needed. Seth and Wray are both extremely friendly, helpful and accommodating; the place was great, as was the location for getting to and from Manhattan. Not to mention the extras they offer like netflix and the loan of the phone - that was a lifesaver for us! Thank you so much for having us.[QWERTY123]Our stay with Seth was excellent! He's a great host, very friendly, helpful and flexible. The apartment is very, very nice, the room is spacious, well equipped (a TV larger than my own:-)) and offers a view of the Manhattan skyline.
The neighborhood is cool and has a lot to offer. The subway is literally around the corner taking you to in Manhattan in minutes.
You should stay here![QWERTY123]Wray was so flexible with our super jetlag. Thank you![QWERTY123]Awesome! I was so intimidated by not knowing New York but Seth was so helpful. Great recommendations for restaurants, getting around, etc. The room was comfortable and had great amenities. I would definitely stay again.[QWERTY123]My staying at Seths place was just awesome! The room is very comfy, it has a huge TV with Netflix (great for rainy days) and Seth was so so so kind lending me a phone with an US number. This made my trip so much easier, my friends in New York could call me and whenever I got lost I looked at the map in the phone. The apartment is located just 2 minutes from the L train. Next time I go to NY I will def stay at Seths place! Great apartment with a great host![QWERTY123]Seth and his girlfriend are really friendly hosts, they are willing to help you at any time. We forgot the key ones, so we had to wake him up! He was not angry at all. The phone he gave us was amazing, without we for sure got lost.. The location is also fantastic, only 2minute walk to the L-train. So next time I will be in NYC, I will try to stay at his place again![QWERTY123]Seth and his girl were the best hosts! Really lovely people, so thorough with details prior to our arrival which ensured everything ran smoothly, not to mention the space is immaculate and we will definately stay with them again! Thank you guys![QWERTY123]I had a great stay with Seth and Wray, The room is as you see in the pictures, which is to say large, cool, and comfortable. Same goes for the rest of the apartment. Coming straight from Australia, the fact that the bed was so comfortable was something I was very grateful for, meant sleeping off the jetlag was a pleasure. And the big tv, with netflix and hulu was a great way to pass the time in between heading out. AND the view from the rooms balcony was, although slightly obstructed by buildings, magnificent. Have a few photos from my phone of the skyline at sunset as a result. The shower had a good pressure as well. All in all, the place itself is 5/5.
Location-wise, its ideal. About 5 stops from Manhattan, but literally a 45 second walk to the subway, which meant the commute to Manhattan is around 10 minutes, and around 5 minutes to the busy part of Williamsburg. 
As for the hosts themselves, you couldn't ask for better. Between my sleep patterns and the guys work schedules, I didn't spend much time with them, but they were nothing but friendly and very helpful when i did. The fact that Seth has a smart phone for you to use for the duration of your stay is A LIFESAVER. it cant be overstated how much easier it makes getting around the city. It also says a lot about the consideration Seth has for his guests and their stay.
All in all, I had only used airbnb to rent whole apartments, never a room in someones house. I'm stoked i decided to follow the reviews of Seth's place and buck the trend, because i would've struggled to find as nice a place for triple the price. Can't recommend enough. Cheers mate![QWERTY123]Seth was an excellent host, provided great information before we arrived and was relaxed, welcoming and helpful. The apartment is just as advertised in a very convenient location near the subway. I would have no hesitation in staying here again![QWERTY123]Seth was a great host.  He offered us suggestions and was really always really friendly.  The apartment is great and in a terrific location for Williamsburg and it is so easy getting into Manhattan too.  I highly recommend staying here![QWERTY123]Seth was a great host! We did not see him much, because we were so jetlagged that we went to bed early and got up very early. But when we did see him, he was very friendly and offered us suggestions about what to do and where to eat. Also, having a smartphone was super! The apartment is great and in a great location. I highly recommend staying here![QWERTY123]Seth and Wray were really helpful hosts, having lived in Brooklyn before it was nice to stay somewhere where the host really knew nice hidden spots to go to in Brooklyn and not the usual tourist trap! The apt was really nice and trendy- the only thing was the bed had a little glitch, but Seth fixed it ASAP and it was a comfortable stay! Thanks Seth![QWERTY123]Apartment was amazing, new, clean and spacious. NY guides were available to borrow. 

The apartment was a minute walk from the subway, walking distance to cafe's etc. Very quick subway trip to Manhattan.

Seth was very helpful, would definitely stay there again![QWERTY123]The location couldn't be better.  Right on top of an L train stop, a walk to vibrant Williamsburg and a quiet street.  The room was cozy and the apartment is beautiful.  Seth and Wray are great hosts, nice and courteous.  I would definitely stay there again.[QWERTY123]We stayed 5 nights at Seth's place end April... it was a great stay. Seth and his girl friend are very friendly and discrete people. We were always outside and didn't see them much. We shared their bathroom and kitchen. Our bedroom was close to the entry door, so we something felt like being in a hotel. We took our breakfast close to the apartment,  a place advised by Seth, it was also quite cool. I would definitely recommend Seth's place to people who wants to visit New-York! Seth's place is 15 min from Manhattan's center. I would myself go back there.[QWERTY123]""+"" = good location (during night seemed also safe), close to train, very open, nice, welcoming and helpful hosts, smart phone (with maps :) );

""-"" = no elevator (carrying bags to 4th floor wasn't easy), no separate bathroom which made us feel uncomfortable sometimes.

The apartment looks different than in pictures as they have redecorated.

Overall experience very good! Thanks Seth![QWERTY123]Seth and Wray's place is incredible. Wray was the perfect host and even stayed up late with us and made us tea. She was able to recommend great non-touristy things to do (including the best pizza I have ever had). Would absolutely love to stay again.[QWERTY123]My girlfriend and I really enjoyed our stay with Seth and Wray.  We arrived late but Seth was very accomodating and left us a cell phone ( Samsung Galaxy at that!! :) ) and keys for both of us . The room was clean and a great guide was laid out and with heavy doors we felt free to be comfortable and not concerned about noise. For the most part we had the loft to the ourselves ( Seth was away and we barely saw Wray) and came and went with no issues. The apartment location was perfect and only about 15mins from downtown Manhattan. We were able to go to some great restaurants in Brooklyn and the suggestion from Seth to take the East River ferry was fantastic!  It's a must do! 

 All in all this was my first Airbnb stay and it was awesome. Seth was a great host and  I could definitely stay there again. Additionally Seth was kind enough to allow us to check out late due to to the fact we were catching a late bus back to Toronto.

I definitely recommend staying here![QWERTY123]We stayed at Seth's for 4 nights, the apartment is fantastic, very comfortable and in a great location in Brooklyn. Both Seth and Wray were lovely hosts and made us feel very welcome in their home. Overall we had a fantastic time and i would highly recommend anyone who's looking to spend time in NY to get in touch with Seth![QWERTY123]We had such a fantastic stay here with Seth and his gorgeous girlfriend.  Right from the start, he made our stay awesome - there was a personalised guide around the neighbourhood, tips for things to do and everything ready to go for us.  He also made us feel really welcome in his place - eager to have a chat when we got home about what we were doing, what he was up to and any other topic that came up - many times over a freshly made cocktail he would whip up for us.  I loved that Seth seemed so keen to genuinely hang out with the people that stay with him, other than just giving them a bed - it really made all the difference to our stay, we didn't feel awkward hanging around their place at all.  I couldn't say enough about them - i would definitely count them both as friends by the end of our stay.   Thanks guys[QWERTY123]Had a fantastic stay at Seths, great place, fantastic location and Seth and his girlfriend were very accommodating hosts. Would highly recommend anyone who wants to see the Williamsburg/Brooklyn out of the hustle and bustle of the city area to stay here. Hoever, all of that is only a short train ride away, you're literally metres away from a subway station.[QWERTY123]Seth and his girlfriend were great hosts. They were always helpful and nice. Seth provided us with a smartphone, which was extremely helpful when we were lost and needed access to (Hidden by Airbnb) maps. Hulu and Netflix was available in our bedroom, which was a nice way to relax after a long day of shopping. We would stay here again![QWERTY123]I had Seth's place recommended to me by a fellow traveller and it did not disappoint. It is perfectly set up for airbnb guests. I would have loved to have stayed longer but Seth's place is in high demand.. and rightly so![QWERTY123]Everyting was great at Seth's home, the view at our room was amazing, very comfortable place, I felt like a friend's home. Seth its very nice and organized, he gave us a very intertesting gide about places to eat, and everything for to have a nice stay there. Williamsburg was the best place were I stayed in NY, the best stores, restaurants are so close, very recomendly stay with Him.[QWERTY123]It was a pleasure to stay with Seth and Wray. Their home is lovely and warm, and they were very thorough in responding to all of our questions. We enjoyed their company very much![QWERTY123]Seth's duplex is amazing, comfortable and cool. It is REALLY close to the L subway station so in just some minutes you are in Manhattan. 

Although Seth was away for most of the time, he and Wray were very friendly and easy going. Amazing recommendations on places to eat on the neighborhood (Roberta's, Momo, Lilly thai...we are already missing those) also the coffee from Lula Bean is a must to begin the day.

Huge flat TV in your room and a cell phone (isn't it awesome?), the phone was really useful to check maps and recommendations on the fly. Thank you guys!

[QWERTY123]Great apartment, terrific and professional hosting. Haven't actually met Seth during my 2 nights there, but the room was as advertised, way better than most hotels I've been to at NYC, and the location is perfect for someone who wants to be close to Manhattan but without the noise and the busy streets. 

[QWERTY123]Seth's apartment was amazing; immaculate and very modern. The neighbourhood was also very nice, with good cafes nearby and a very conveniently located subway station. Last but not least by any means is Seth himself, who is an extremely nice and relaxed guy. I would highly recommend his apartment to anyone both new and seasoned to airbnb.[QWERTY123]A terrific stay. Super clean room and a great space that's just like the photos make it appear to be.  Not only wonderful accommodations, but splendid hospitality as I was invited to not one but two dinners. Met some interesting people and was treated like a friend. Highly recommend staying here if you are lucky enough to get a booking.[QWERTY123]I can't say enough about Seth and Wray. The house is lovely, the room is awesome and they're two of the coolest, most friendly, fun, kind and helpful hosts you could ever find. Indian takeout, an ice-cream run followed by a whisky and espresso tasting was how I spent my first evening with them - just perfect! I had such a good weekend here and everything was so comfortable and plush. All I wanted to do was curl up in bed and watch TV (Hulu and Netflix available) on the massive screen in my room - which I did! The location is great and cabs and subway are easily available and the photos actually don't do the place justice. Yeah ... it's THAT great. I had some last minute changes with my check-in (I came early) and check-out (I had to leave two hours later than the original time given) and they were so accomodating and didn't make it an issue at all, which is so appreciated. Thanks so much, guys! Deffo staying with them again the next time I'm in New York.[QWERTY123]Seth was a great host... helpful, communicative and kind. The room was perfect for my stay and had a comfortable bed and huge TV with Netflix (quite the novelty for someone who doesn't have TV at home). Seth's place is very close to the L train subway - perfect for getting in and out of Manhattan. The guide he provided was really handy too, with some nice food recommendations.[QWERTY123]I had a wonderful stay with Seth and his girlfriend! The apartment was beautiful and they were very friendly. I hope to come back very soon, highly recommended![QWERTY123]This is the best place on Airbnb that I've stayed at so far.  The bed was very comfortable. The bathroom was fantastic.  We were greeted with a welcome book which had a list of useful information and suggestions.  It really is a great place.

The neighborhood is safe.  The L Train is just around the corner and it can get you into Manhattan very quickly.  There is a fantastic European cuisine restaurant around the corner that just opened called ""Williamsburg Kitchen"" at 804 Grand St.  The food there is outstanding. If you like good food eating there is a must!

Next time I come to NY I will definitely try to stay here first.[QWERTY123]Really enjoyed our stay again. The apartment is even better since the recent renovations and location is very convenient for Brooklyn and Manhattan with the L train so close.[QWERTY123]My wife and I spent a fantastic week at Seth's. He and Wray were wonderful hosts, very nice and very helpful throughout our entire stay. Their Penthouse Apartment deserves all the praise. The bed was very cozy and comfortable which was great after a long and exhausting day of sightseeing. The bathroom was very clean and was used exclusively by us. The japanese toilet was interesting ;-) Another point which you might not find on any other Airbnb stay: Seth was so kind as to lend us a cell phone with unlimited data access which was very helpful while wandering through the streets of NYC. From our point of view the neighborhood appeared to be very safe. Williamsburg is very trendy with a couple of nice bars, cafes and restaurants. The closest subway station is just around the corner and you can get to Manhattan in under 10 minutes. All in all, the perfect place for our first Airbnb experience and our first trip to New York. We would come back any time and highly recommend a stay at Seth's. 5 Stars are fully deserved!!![QWERTY123]I very much enjoyed my stay at Seth's duplex. It was clean, comfortable, conveniently located, and a great value. Seth was a great host. He was very laid back, accommodating, and a real pleasure.[QWERTY123]Such wonderful hosts, what a fab place to stay. It was ideal in every way. From the location close to the L-line to the kick-ass bed. Thank you for all the great care![QWERTY123]Highly recommended! This place is excellent - great location next to the Ltrain (20min from the door to Union Square), clean room, good bed, fast internet, quiet, own blacony, lots of restaurants/bars and shops around, etc. A great home-base for a NY stay in the eastern end of Williamsburg. 

Seth & Wray were perfect hosts. Definitely will be back my next NY trip.


[QWERTY123]This is a great option in NYC --- nicely located and easy to get into Manhattan. The room is perfect - comfortable, well appointed, private and easy to come and go as you please. Seth is a great host who supplies on-the-money info about the surrounding area making it a breeze to navigate, find somewhere to eat or drink etc. Definitely recommended.[QWERTY123]Where do I start? I fell in love with Seth's Apartment since I saw it on airbnb.com. When I finally checked in, everything looked exactly the same as in the pictures.  

My bed was really comfortable, and the TV is huge and have netflix as well as hulu plus, I always have something to watch.
Seth even prepared a cell phone with US number for me to use during my stay.

Location is good and the L-Train station is just around the corner.

Seth is a super awesome host.  I even had a couple of drinks one night with Seth and his friends watching some tv shows (I played the Pinball Machine, it really works with that cool sounds) 
He also helped me with recommendation about my New Orleans trip and connected me with his friends in NOLA.

I will definitely stay at Seth's place on my next trip to NYC.[QWERTY123]What a fantastic place to stay — Seth providing a really welcoming home in New York, combining homeliness with coolness and class. I can't recommend staying here as your port of call when in Brooklyn: I certainly intend to be back again as soon as I can.[QWERTY123]This was a very nice and enjoyable flat, giving a very comfortable stay. The area is nice, although not as busy and exciting as areas like Lower East side on Manhattan, but great transport most of the time on the L line over there. Didn't see much of Seth or his girlfriend and they weren't around for when we were leaving which seemed a bit odd, but not the biggest issue. 
Overall a good stay for New York.[QWERTY123]Seth was away for most of our stay, and as a result we didn't see much of him or Wray. Nonetheless, they provided us with some very good recommendations. Seth and Wray really know the neighborhood, and have discovered some great places to eat and things to do. (Some of their notes are a little outdated; just double-check before hand and you'll be fine.)

The apartment itself is comfortable and up-to-date, although we didn't spend much time in it. It's very close to the Grand St. subway station, which really came in handy. The room they provide is comfortable and private.

Overall, it was a great first Airbnb experience for us, and we would recommend Seth to anyone spending some time in New York City.[QWERTY123]Seth is a welcoming and accommodating host. His home is comfortable and he made us feel at home. The location is right next to a train station so it is accessible.

We would definitely stay here again and recommend him to friends!

[QWERTY123]great place, great hosts, funny dogs -  we really enjoyed our stay in NYC. seth gave us great advices about the area which were all perfect. dont miss that mexican place just around the corner.
thanks again seth and wray for having us!![QWERTY123]We stayed a week at Seth's place and had a great time. Very convenient location right next to subway, the room was very comfy with a very comfortable bed. Nice area as well with hip places to discover - Seth will always know where you should go or what to check out. Would stay there again and can highly recommend it for a NY visit. 
[QWERTY123]Nice apartment (with bath!), great area and good host. Go![QWERTY123]Nice apartment and convienent location. Seth even did our laundry! We arrived really late into NY, at 12am, and by the time we arrived we were exhausted. Late access was easily organised and Seth had prep our room, with towels, toiletries, comprehensive guidebook and even a bottle of wine! He also lent us a mobile phone, which was very handy especially having the GPS/maps and internet access.What he has described in the listing pages is 100% accurate.
Dogs? To be honest, we didn't know they were up there with him. 
Rain shower was good. Netflix/Hulu TV was great too. One tip: Organise for a cab/car when you depart, as there was a lack of cabs when we tried to 'hail' one down.[QWERTY123]Seth is a wonderful host with a wonderful accommodation. The apartment is beautiful and clean, the bathroom and bedroom (and bed!) comfortable and nicely appointed. The guest room and bath are right inside the apartment door, and I felt I had as much privacy as I wanted, despite the fact I was sharing Seth's apartment. Like a hotel, Seth provides a lot of information about what to do, where to eat and how to get around the city in his own travel packet. I will definitely stay at this airbnb again. Thank you, Seth.[QWERTY123]Great stay with Seth in Williamsburg! We were there for nine nights but because it is NYC we didn't spend that much time at the apartment, but it was exactly as the pictures show. When we did bump into Seth he asked how we were finding things and offered some tips. The apartment is just around the corner from the Grand St subway stop so we could normally get downtown within 15mins, the grey L line is actually awesome because it connects to all the other north-south lines so it is super easy to get to anywhere on Manhattan. We normally ate in the city before getting back to Williamsburg but Seth does have a book of places he likes to eat which we took advantage of a couple of times. Would be super keen to return when I save up more money :)[QWERTY123]Seth was a great host, knows a lot about NYC, and had great recommendations. The flat was very clean and tidy, exactly as in pictures. Would recommend this listing![QWERTY123]A lot of good stuff has already been said about Seth's apartment in previous reviews. No need for repetitions. This is an awesome pad. You will like it.

It's a great base from which to explore Brooklyn as well as Manhattan. The subway is literally right around the corner, and you can reach Union Square (and, of course, anywhere in Williamsburg) in less than 20 minutes, door-to-door.

If you are hesitant to book this place because you worry about the lack of privacy in a ""private room"" vs. an ""entire apartment"" - fret no more. You have your own bathroom, and pretty much your own floor. Seth is a super cool guy, and it was great fun to hang out with him when we were both at home. However I am confident that, had I been looking for complete solitude, I would have gotten it.

This was my first time staying at Seth's apartment, and I would book it again any day![QWERTY123]We loved our stay at Seth's apartment. After 3 months of travelling, my friend and I wanted nothing more than a place to call home for 7 nights. We were extremely comfortable in this apartment and made good use of Seth's kitchen and cable TV when we wanted a quiet night. The apartment is in a fantastic location right in the heart of Williamsburg's best eateries and nightlife. Seth's knowledge of NYC is very impressive and we would have no hesitation in staying at his apartment again when we next return to NYC![QWERTY123]I had a wonderful stay at Seth's place. His flat is perfectly located, very close from the subway station and a taxi station if you need take one. The neighbourhood offers a lot to explore especially restaurants, cafés and bars. It has a flair that you won't find in Manhattan which definitively worth the visit. Seth has very tastefully decorated his place and keep it very clean and comfy. I felt fully satisfied with my room, so cosy and well-equipped. I especially enjoyed the balcony of the room which has a very cool view. Moreover Seth was very helpful and nice. He provided me with a very useful guide for my stay and answered very patiently all my questions. Go for it, you won't regret it... it has everything you wish when staying in nyc.[QWERTY123]Seth's willamsburg apartment was a real gem. Clean, modern and comfortable. Seth greeted me and was so organized with meet up details and answered all my questions with a smile. He has a local guide of all cool things to do locally. It was a great stay. Carefree and so close to manhattan too. Thanks Seth.[QWERTY123]Just as advertised an awesome place in an ideal location.  Very happy I stayed here, easy communication and would happily recommend to others. A+++[QWERTY123]We had an amazing stay at Seth's Brooklyn pad. The location was perfect and it was a great base for exploring ny for the first time. Super clean and well equipped, we had everything we needed including an awesome host to give us some handy tips about what we wanted to do during our stay. Seth's recommendations for Brooklyn restaurants and activities are spot on. Would definitely stay here again next time we're in ny and can highly recommend for anyone else.[QWERTY123]What a wonderful base to explore NYC/Brooklyn! The apartment itself is beautiful and clean, with all the amenities you would expect of a hotel. On a clear day, the view from the room is a picturesque snapshot of the Manhattan skyline from across the river. Seth was a kind and generous host - follow his advice, he won't lead you astray. You'd need a month to work through his restaurant suggestions. We had a week and ate incredibly well every single day. No negatives here, Seth is a class act with a classy apartment.[QWERTY123]Seth is a kind person and a great host. The place looks exactly like the pictures and we had a comfortable stay in Seth's apartment. Thanks for the hospitality and the helpful suggestions! We had a wonderful time :)[QWERTY123]Beautiful apartment! My jaw literally dropped when we first walked in. Exactly as the pictures. Great location, super close to the subway which is so convenient. Would definitely recommend this place, thanks Seth!![QWERTY123]Great penthouse, great room, great view, great host, great neighbourhood!!! In short: a great place while in NYC[QWERTY123]Great apartment in a great location and Seth was an excellent host.

Spent 10 days here on a holiday and the room was extremely clean and comfortable, Seth had the place v well prepared and was helpful with any info I needed. 

Checking in and checking out was really easy (there was wine and fresh towels/soap on the bed when I arrived.)

This is an ideal place if you want some privacy, the design of the flat means you feel very free to come and go without having to walk past other bedrooms etc.

Also the bathroom is practically your own en-suite (good cascade shower) which again makes it less like staying in somebody else's apartment. 

I was out quite a bit at different times to Seth but whenever we chatted he had plenty of tips about the area and he sent me a useful Word doc with some bar and restaurant info.

The area is great too, you're not far from Williamsburg and on your way the main street near the apartment has tons of good bars and places to eat. But Bushwick is also close by so there are plenty of fun places there too.

You're right beside an L station so you can get into Manhattan in no time at all.

Would recommend this place for sure - couldn't find any fault with it.[QWERTY123]My friend Jenna & I had the BEST time staying with Seth.

The apartment is as awesome as it looks in the listing. I was in absolute awe when I arrived!

The shower was amazing and an absolute god send after our long days out & about in New York. The bed was extremely comfy too.

Seth was a fantastic host, really friendly and super helpful. 

I cannot thank him enough for helping me with my bags when I left. 

It was my first trip to the States so I had plenty of questions to ask and Seth was extremely knowledgeable and happy to assist. 

The guide that Seth had created was really useful too. If you are staying, you HAVE to visit Egg. I would have quite happily gone there everyday for brunch!

I've told so many friends about the apartment and I can't wait to plan another trip to New York. I would definitely look at booking in again. 

Thanks Seth![QWERTY123]Nice ! Seth is an Excellent Host . He is still available to your enquiries and he makes you feel at home ... 

[QWERTY123]The place was great. Will def stay again. It was quiet, clean and delux. When I walked in there was a bottle of wine, a box of chocolates and chocolate waiting for me along with anhand written note. Super lovely touch. The bed was fluffy and very comfortable. The shower was superb. Theres even laundry in the place but I didnt realize it until I was leaving. Seth was away but made contact via text and email. He was super. Did I mention that the place was quiet and perfect for doing work? Awesome host with an awesome pad. Thanks Seth![QWERTY123]We really enjoyed our stay at Seth's apartment. 
The apartment is clean and modern with the most comfy bed. You have a large bathroom basically to yourself as Seth uses the one upstairs. 
It is really well located in an area with shops and good restaurants a short walk away, and the subway is super close. 

Seth was always willing to give suggestions on good restaurants and bars as well as things to do whilst in NY. 

Thanks heaps Seth, we appreciate all your help![QWERTY123]The house is beautiful and clean like in the photo! A very nice bedroom, a bathroom only for you! very good position: a few steps to the metro.
Seth unfortunately was not in new york during my vacation, but we were in contact every day by mail and he answered me about every question i asked him!
A perfect host even if from a distance!
thank you seth, i hope to come back to newyork soon!
[QWERTY123]Seth has an amazing apartment, super modern and fun with a huge television and comfy bed. He gave me a bottle of wine the first night. Would recommend fully![QWERTY123]Clean, tidy, and very well described in his own description. I highly recommend Seth as a host, at no point did I worry about my stay.

Read his description, and use your stay for what it was supposed to be spent on, YOU! :)[QWERTY123]Great flat, great location, Seth (a very friendly host) let us feel right at home. Would definitely recommend it and book it for a future trip![QWERTY123]A very beautiful appartment, with a comfortable bed and a private bathroom. Everything was exactly like the picture en was very clean. The location of the appartment is perfect: a few steps to the metro, which brings you to Manhattan in a couple of minutes. But do not forget the neighborhood; Williamsburg is also really awesome!

Seth is a very friendly and relaxed host. He had the answers to all of our questions and gave us a lot of very good recommendations!

I highly recommend staying at Seth's when going to New York! Perfect place to stay![QWERTY123]Seth's apartment was fantastic!  It is very much the same as advertised.  As a host, Seth was extremely accommodating and had plenty of great tips for places to check out in the area.  He was friendly and very easy to get in touch with.  The location was perfect with easy access to the L train. I'd definitely return on my next visit to NYC.[QWERTY123]Seth was also very responsive and the location of the apartment is great. Just steps away from the Grand Street, L Train subway station.[QWERTY123]Gorgeous place! The host was so accommodating! Wish we had more time to hang out![QWERTY123]This apartment is definitely as lux as advertised. Seth is a knowledge host and suggested many sights around NYC. I would recommend it to anyone respectful and responsible. The room has an fantastic view of the Manhattan skyline and it's incredibly close to the subway![QWERTY123]We really scored with a host like Seth for a first-timers visit to NYC. In such an overwhelming city we were so lucky to have Seth guide us in the right direction. Our most memorable moment of the trip came from one of Seth's suggestions - Museum Hack - highly recommend!
The apartment was such a haven from the hustle and bustle, and the location was prime. We loved the coffee shop round the corner - Lulu bean - awesome bagels!
Seth's is definitely the place to stay for your NYC visit.[QWERTY123]Seth is the man! He was a very gracious host who ensured we had everything we needed for our stay. He gave us great suggestions for what to do in the neighborhood and throughout the city. Plus, his place is awesome! We had our own bathroom and what felt like an entire floor of the apartment. We had plenty of privacy but he was still extremely available to help guide us toward his curated experience of the city (the guy knows his town well). Anyone looking for a great place to stay in the city should contact Seth. We can't thank him enough for a great stay.[QWERTY123]Seth was great! Everything from check in to check out went very smooth and Seth was very accommodating to our time schedule. The subway was literally around the corner which was extremely convenient.  Seth's apartment was a great, comfortable place to come back to after long days of exploring the city. Definitely recommend it to any and every traveler looking for a great place in NY![QWERTY123]I had a great stay at Seth's place. Hints and tips were spot on and meant I didn't miss a minute researching what to do or getting lost. I came and went as I pleased and got exactly what I expected - to be a local for a couple of days. Thanks![QWERTY123]We had a great stay at Seth's. He was super accommodating and his tips were extremely helpful. The neighborhood is great and his apartment couldn't be in a better location, super safe and right around the corner from the subway! The room itself was great and it felt like we had a whole floor to ourselves. Seth's a great guy, you couldn't find a better place to stay in Williamsburg.[QWERTY123]Seth's apartment was nice and modern, close to the subway and comfortable. Seth was friendly and gave us good suggestions for things to do. My only suggestion is if you are booking this apartment to bring an eye shade as the light comes in quite strong in the morning.[QWERTY123]We had an absolutely fantastic stay in Seth's lovely apartment. The location is great both for Manhattan and Williamsburg and the apartment itself is nice, clean and comfortable. Seth is a wonderful host: helpful and easy-going. Standing ovation to the whole package :-) ![QWERTY123]Seth was a great host and I am glad I stayed with him for a week. He is very polite and gives great recommendations about what to see and do in the City. 
The apartment is basically separated in two parts. Seth sleeps upstairs so you have a lot of privacy by staying in a separate bedroom on the first floor. You also have your own bathroom. The neighborhood is interesting and fun and though I felt comfortable there during the day, I felt a little unsafe coming home late at night as the area tends to become a little abandoned - but that's no big deal if you are used to New York. 
Overall I would definitely recommend staying with Seth! Thanks for everything - especially the peanut butter :-)[QWERTY123]Seth's place was great.  Extremely easy to get around, the subway is right around the corner (both the restaurant and the transportation method).  Seth had some great tips for the city and I would stay there again.[QWERTY123]We had a great stay at Seth's apartment. It's literally steps from the train station and really close to get into Manhattan. The flat itself is comfortable and quiet, with plenty of privacy as Seth's bedroom is located on a separate floor to the guest bedroom and living area. He had lots of great tips for things to do in the area - just wish we'd had time to tick more things off the list! Really nice Neighbourhood and close to lots of nice bars, restaurants etc. Thanks again![QWERTY123]What an amazing place--and it is literally right on top of the subway! Seth has a ton of rave reviews, and I can see why. I go to NYC for business almost monthly and this is going to be my first choice location from here on out.  

The apartment itself is perfect: clean, modern, well lit, very large, and with all the amenities you would need as a traveller (it even has crazy remote-controlled blinds that made me feel like I was in a science-fiction movie). The bed was so comfortable that I asked Seth to give me the name of the manufacturer so I could buy one myself. The room has a beautiful view of the NYC skyline, a large TV with Netflix, and everything you would need to relax and kick back if you want to stay at the apartment. There is a lot of privacy and a private bathroom. Since Seth sleeps on a different floor, it felt a lot like I had my own apartment. And the egg chair in the guest bedroom is a must.

Seth was such an awesome host – and even took me out for a drink at a local bar while showing me around the neighborhood (it's in Williamsburg, which is a really lively and young area).[QWERTY123]We had a great stay at Seth's apartment, which is set inbetween two hip Brooklyn neighbourhoods - Williamsburg and Bushwick. The apartment was very comfortable, especially the bed - we slept as babies. And we loved the view from our balcony.

Seth was very clear about everything, how to reach the apartment etc. Also, Seth sent us a list of restaurant and activities to do in the city, which we gladly used. 

So if you're looking for a nice comfortable place to stay in Brooklyn, Seth is your man.[QWERTY123]Seth's Apartment was just great and I would recommend it any time. Unfortunatly I didn't get to meet Seth in person, since we were quite busy with Sightseeing but Seth left us a nice welcoming note with some choclate and always answered all of our questions as fast as possible. The Check-in was really flexible and unclompicated. Also Seth had a guide prepared with lots of tips that helped us get around. This was our first experience with airbnd and everything worked out great. 
[QWERTY123]Seth was great, very warm, inviting, and considerate. He's very easy to reach and prompt in responding to whatever questions I had. His place is exactly what you see. He lives on the top floor, but I didn't see him during the short time I was there. It's very much like having the entire place to yourself. There's a lot of space and a lot of privacy. The neighborhood is safe and easy to get to. Not too many complaints here.[QWERTY123]My stay with Seth was my first airbnb experience and I'm pleased to say it was a positive one. Seth communicated well with me from the time of booking and was always available when I had questions - very fast reactions and always pleasant. Seth really takes care of his guests and wants them to have a great stay.

I found the flat slightly smaller than it looks on the photos but it is just as amazing, clean, and the views of Manhattan from the balcony are great. The location is fantastic, in a safe area, and the subway is literally a 1 min walk away with fast connections to Manhattan on the L train (from Grand St. station). 

Seth made sure I felt at home and let me use the kitchen, store things in the fridge etc. He even did laundry for me when we kept missing each other for me to ask if I could use his washing machine. I didn't see that much of Seth or his girlfriend but when I did, they were always helpful and Seth is very knowledgable about his area and NYC in general and gave me some good tips for places to go and where to eat etc.

I loved the Lula Bean Cafe, which is about 5 doors down from the Dunkin Donuts on Grand St. Great coffee, bagels and free wifi. There are other good restaurants within walking distance too.

All in all, I had a great stay with Seth and I can highly recommend him and his apartment. My next airbnb stay has a lot to live up to :o)
[QWERTY123]We stayed with Seth for 9 days for our first time visit to New York. He was an extremely attentive host and made sure everything was comfortable during our stay. Seth is very organized and easy going, and gave us a lot of amazing nearby restaurant suggestions. We had the most comfortable bed and a great room with a private bathroom. Best of all, Seth acquired a second pinball machine and let us try it out! Thanks for giving us such a wonderful experience staying in New York! We'll definitely stay with you the next time we visit the city again![QWERTY123]My boyfriend and I stayed with Seth for four nights and would highly recommend his room for a trip to New York. The location allowed us to easily get in to and out of Manhattan as well as making a great base for exploring Williamsburg. 

Seth is well organised with heaps of guidebooks and maps for visitors and gave us some great tips for restaurants and activities off the beaten track which is exactly the local knowledge one would want. He even brought us out for drinks and gave us his own tour of the neighbourhood. Seth is an interesting guy and was there if we wanted to socialize without curbing our independence. 

The room itself was quiet and has a great view of Manhattan which was lovely to see when stepping out onto the balcony. The apartment is really cool with lots of interesting gadgets and furniture, never mind the fun pinball machines! 

All in all this was a great experience as first time airbnb users and we are happy to recommend Seth, and would choose to stay there again. 

[QWERTY123]We had a good stay at this appartment in Brooklyn. The appartment does not have an elevator but Seth was there to help us carry our luggage upstairs which was great! 

We enjoyed Brooklyn as we got to experience the New York life instead of only seeing Manhattan and all its tourist attractions. The room was good in size and the bathroom was good too! 

If you want to talk Seth is there, if you want to go your own way it is fine too! We enjoyed playing on the pinball machine as well! 

When you decide to stay here we would like to recommend Bread Brothers Bagel Cafe which is located just around the corner from the fish market! :)[QWERTY123]Seth's room was great! Williamsburg was very quite and safety place, and easy to get to Manhattan by subway. Seth was so careful and kind person as many reviews said.
Bed was very comfortable, and Starwars chair was awesome! I like it!
I recommend his room absolutely. It's better choice than any hotel in Manhattan. His room is clean and cozy, has beautiful view! Don't worry his room is located in Brooklyn. New York has many subway lines, so we can go anywhere quickly.[QWERTY123]Seth's place is great! It has everything you need to feel like if you were at home. The room is very comfortable, the bed was great and the linen, really soft. The balcony's view allows to see the awsome NY skyline.
We like cooking, so we could use the kitchen and appliences needed.
Seth is in every detail, makes good suggestinons and helps in everything you need (like trying to get Netflix with spanish subtitles).
We asked Seth some suggestions for Kitchen supplies and he kindly gave us a pepper shaker and a wine set as a present.
He was also so kind helping us with our luggage up and downstairs.

The location is very good if you wish to stay in a quiet place, not far from Manhattan. I recommend bars and restaurants in Morgan L train. Subway is 1 short block from the apartment and takes you to Manhattan in 15 minutes.[QWERTY123]This was my first air bnb experience and Seth made it very easy by having clear expectations. The room was a great size, the bed comfortable and enough space to unpack. The big window was lovely so the room was nice and bright. The weather turned during my stay so I was a little chilly in the mornings. When I saw Seth he was always checked that everything was going well with my stay. I would stay there again the next time I visit the area![QWERTY123]I had a great stay at Seth's. Seth's apartment was nice and comfortable and close to the subway. Seth is very friendly and gave me suggestions for things to do. It's really a nice place to stay in Williamsburg. I would stay there again. Thanks Seth!![QWERTY123]I typically fork up the dough and rent out a full space, but between the rave reviews, the beautiful pictures, and the seeming privacy of the floor plan, I took a chance on a private room for my boyfriend and I.  It wasn't the right decision in my case, but if I was traveling solo I think it would have been.

Pros: The host is nice and easy to communicate with, he provided some great suggestions, the mattress is comfortable, and the subway stop is very accessible. 

Cons: The place was not as immaculate as the pictures, there was a lot of clutter, so the energy flow that is so apparent in the pics was lacking.  Although we were welcomed to make ourselves ""comfortable,"" the host was working from home during the day, and had guests  (this was in the main living area right outside our door) - so we lived out of the small bedroom, coming out only to use the bathroom.



[QWERTY123]We had a fantastic time staying at Seth's! I don't think we could have chosen a better place to stay for our first Airbnb experience. Seth was a top host and provided lots of great tips and suggestions that made for a really memorable trip, and he was easy to contact at all times. Loved the apartment and our room; at the end of a busy day sightseeing, we always had a comfortable and relaxing place to go back to. (It's just like in the photos - airy, spacious and inviting.) The subway is literally just seconds around the corner from the apartment building, and I'd definitely recommend Lula Bean or Bread Brothers Bagels for picking up breakfast on your way into the city. During our week staying in Williamsburg, we really felt like locals as we commuted into Manhattan each day and got to know the local area. Be sure to explore Brooklyn as well as the city; we loved the Brooklyn flea market, Roberta's for pizza, Fette Sau for BBQ and the chicken and waffles at Pies & Thighs. Thanks again to Seth for having us, we'll definitely look you up if we come back to NYC :-)[QWERTY123]The apartment is as good as it appears on the listing.
The bed is good, the shower is good, the apartment is amazing, it's right next to the subway (which makes it much easier to come back home after you've walked for 18 hours) and there is plenty to do in Williamsburg day and night, if you feel like it.
Seth is a great host, he made us feel at home and gave us lots of great tips about NYC and the neighborhood, I would definitely recommend staying at his place.[QWERTY123]Seth is a very nice host. He made us feel quite comfortable and at home. He has sent us a lot of information about everything we might need and it was very useful! The house is exactly like the description and is situated on a safe neighborhood and very very close to the subway. We really enjoyed staying at Seth’s house.[QWERTY123]This was our first airbnb experience. My boyfriend and I stayed at this apartment for five nights. The room is quiet, has a great size and the bed is awesome. The room has also a great view of Manhattan which was lovely to see when stepping out onto the balcony. 
The first two days we stayed alone at the apartment, but Seth was always checked that everything was going well. He's a really nice guy. Unfortunately we saw him just two times.
He sent us a guidebook and maps and also gave us some great tips for restaurants and activities.

The location is perfect, very close to Manhatten!

All in all this was a great experience and we are happy to recommend Seth! We would choose to stay there again.[QWERTY123]Todo perfecto, la recepción excelente y bien coordinada. La habitación y el departamento tal como aparece en las fotos. El barrio tranquilo con muy buen acceso al metro. Recomendable 100%.[QWERTY123]Seth was very communicative for the few days leading up to our arrival to ensure that we had what we needed. Once we arrived, he was very helpful and while we only saw him a few times during our stay, he made sure that we had what we needed. We appreciated being able to have a few friends over to hang out in his cool living room and play his pinball machines!  His apartment is pretty much as it looks in photos and the bed was comfy. Very close to the subway and a quick 10-15 minute ride to Union Square which was nice. We also appreciated his suggestions of things to do/see in NYC and wish we could have had more time to explore Brooklyn more![QWERTY123]We had a wonderful stay in Seth's apartment. The room and apartment are just as described, and being literally around the corner from the subway made getting around Brooklyn and back to Manhattan so easy. It's only two subway stops or about a fifteen minute walk into the heart of Williamsburg. Seth was super helpful and nice and made us feel really welcome whenever our paths crossed. (And the bed is literally the softest bed I have ever slept in - I wish I'd looked at the linen brand before we left!) Thanks again Seth![QWERTY123]Nice place, the host was helpful with any questions we had. The apartment is not far from the subway, which was convenient. There were also a lot of coffee shops and grocery stores nearby. Around the corner you have a bank and a car service, which came in handy when we needed a ride to JFK airport. The apartment was quiet, a lot of times we had the place for ourselves.[QWERTY123]Seth made me feel very welcome when I arrived in Williamsburg. The apartment was nice and clean and my room was nice with a big window. He made sure it was warm enough. The bathroom was right next door and i almost had it to myself, certainly during the night and morning. I only used the room and bathroom as there is so much to do in New York I wasn't at home apart from to sleep. It was quiet and calm when I was in. Seth was very discreet and private, but made it clear I could ask questions if I had any. The area is not at the the heart of Williamsburg's shops, bars and restaurants, but it is seconds away from the subway, its also very fast into Manhattan. I would recommend this apartment.[QWERTY123]Our host was very helpful, timely with communication and easy to deal with. The area is fantastic and the apartment was impressive, exceeding our expectations as advertised.[QWERTY123]Pretty much the best Airbnb ever. The place was huge, very clean, and full of fun toys (Seth even has a pair of pinball machines!) The location was great - literally around the corner from the subway, and near lots of great bars and restaurants and shops (check out Noorman’s Kil for great whiskey and grilled cheese!) The apartment is very modern in its design and decor, has tons of space, and you have a large room and private bathroom. Seth stays on a different floor, so you have a lot of privacy and it basically feels like a separate, private apartment. He also had lots of suggestions for things to do that I wouldn’t have known about - great for getting off the tourist paths. He also let me dip into his impressive whiskey collection. Really great experience. Would definitely stay again.[QWERTY123]Seth is an amazing host; he made us feel at home which is a great start for any visitor. Not only that he provided us with plenty of tips for visiting, dining and going out. I was unsure about Airbnb, but staying over at Seth has left me with a great experience and homely feeling. I highly recommend anyone to stay at Seth's apartment.
[QWERTY123]Seth was the best host I have had. He was consciences, caring and respectful.   The place was amazing and the location was supper !   

11 Stars!![QWERTY123]My boyfriend and I had a wonderful stay in Seth's apartment!! The room and apartment are just as described, and being literally around the corner from the subway made getting around Brooklyn and back to Manhattan so easy. It's about a ten minute walk into the heart of Williamsburg. Seth was super helpful and nice and made us feel really welcome whenever our paths crossed.  Seth was super helpful and the accommodations in his gorgeous home were the best of the best! We highly recommend this home.  Thanks again Seth![QWERTY123]Seth was a great host. We had a great time! The location is superb! Just next to the subway station. Good connection to Manhattan! With best recommendations. We would love to stay again.[QWERTY123]This was a great first AirBnb experience for us. Seth was so welcoming and gave us great pre-arrival information as well as advice for exploring the city. His apartment is clean and airy with a great view from the roof.  The five flights to the apartment were a bit of a slog at the end of a long day with luggage/bags, but hey, it's good to keep fit! The subway is just around the corner which makes getting to and from Manhattan easy. Thanks a million, Seth![QWERTY123]Our stay at Seth's was fantastic! Everything is exactly as described. The apartment is  great, the room is comfortable and clean, and the view of the city from the balcony and the roof terrace couldn't be better. The subway is right around the corner so it's very easy to get to Manhattan. The Williamsburg neighborhood with a lot of bars, restaurants and shops is also worth exploring! Seth was a great host, very helpful and had a lot of tips for us. Definitely a great place to stay in New York![QWERTY123]Seth is so sweet. I felt really comfortable staying at his place. Seth knows his way around town so was able to help me with directions in getting around the city. I would recommend his place to anyone wanting to stay and have recommended his place to my friends. Thank you, Seth. Take care and all the best! Suzanne :) 
[QWERTY123]First, thank you Seth for a wonderful stay. You rock. We had a blast and we HAVE to come back!

Seth really encompasses what should be the standard of every Airbnb stay. First of all he is very helpful both prior and during your trip. He answered very quickly and in depth whenever vi had questions. Add to that that Seth also notified us during our stay whenever the L-train was cancelled – and how to get around that. 
Also if there where a sweet warehouse party going on etc. He was constantly making sure that our stay was to be as good as possible.

Add to that the room was in perfect condition, clean, the bathroom was clean, big and private and the location of the apt is outstanding. Going to Manhattan/Bushwick could’nt be easier with the L line in the back yard, literally.

Finally Seths tips for restaurants, things to do and what not is the BEST. We wish we’ve had more time to explore them – all of those we tried did not dissapoint, whether it was a restaurant, a bar, a route around Williamsburg. Whatever it was it was a very good. 

Finally finally Seth is a nice guy and fairly good at pinballin’. :).
[QWERTY123]Decent experience overall. Seth was welcoming, and showed us all around the apartment and explained all the rules when we arrived. He was actually gone on vacation while we were there, so we didn't have much time to hang out with him, but he seems like a nice guy. The apartment is a decent size, and well appointed. Room is a little small, but that's probably standard for New York. As mentioned in other reviews, the Metro L train is just across the street, so not even a five minute walk, followed by a 20 min ride puts you in midtown Manhattan. Some negatives: The apartment was a bit dirty when we arrived, but the next day a cleaning person came and it showed marked improvement. The neighborhood is ""up and coming"" or ""gritty"" so to speak. While it's probably not dangerous, per se, it certainly is better suited for young, hip, urban-dwellers than families or older couples, for example. But again, the metro is across the street, so it's not that big of a deal.[QWERTY123]Seth was an amazing host. He made Chris and myself feel welcomed and right at home. The place was beautiful and clean. With an amazing view.  He even showed Chris the right way to play his pinball machine. He was always available to help if needed and has amazing suggestions for restaurants , bars and overall experiences throughout the city. Finding his place was easy and getting around even easier. I would definitely and have already recommend staying with Seth. I could not ask for a better stay then what Seth provided. We only wish we could have had more time.[QWERTY123]We had a great time staying at Seth's place. The flat was cosy and a nice place to come home to after a day in the city. It was in a quiet neighborhood so you could sleep with an open window. The subway is just around the corner. The TV-set in the living room  was rather complicated but who needs that in NY City when you've got a pinballmachine you can play endlessly.  Seth made us feel welcome with a gift and a tour of the flat. You have a lot of privacy as he only shares the front door and lives upstairs. He was always helpfull and gave tips on what to do or not to do. If ever going back to New York we would definitely stay here again. Don't forget to check out the roof top terrace with a great view over the Manhattan skyline.[QWERTY123]Seth's place served my needs perfectly for my stay in NY to attend my son's wedding. Seth was accommodating in every way, and I especially valued having my own private bath and room. About ten minutes into lower Manhattan on the L line, East Williamsburg is perfectly situated for almost anything New York. I personally recommend the Willburg Cafe (open early for a vegy breakfast) and Sage, a Thai restaurant on Graham. 
Having tons of family and friends and family to spend valued time with I didn't get a chance to know Seth well at all, but he certainly seemed a happening guy in a happening neighborhood...[QWERTY123]The apartment is tidy, modern and as shown in the photos. Seth is a very thorough communicator prior to arrival and easy to coordinate with. He was also a welcoming host and offered many suggestions about the local neighborhood that made my stay memorable. The location is close to the train and walkable to many bars and restaurants. I recommend staying here![QWERTY123]Seth made a great effort to get in touch with me before the trip.  He even offered to let me use one of his mobile phones while I was in New York.  His place is exactly as the photos show.  It's tastefully decorated and I thoroughly enjoyed my stay there.  The location same block as the subway!) is great and I totally recommend going for a walk around the neighbourhood to familiarise yourself with the area.  Go find Mash and the Bear and try some of their craft beers (and delicious Russian food).  And you have to make time to go enjoy the rooftop terrace! It really is fantastic. And woowww the bed is SUPER COMFY![QWERTY123]This was my first time using air bnb and not only was the apt as cool as it looks in the photos, Seth made it a great experience. Great communication throughout the whole process, helpful, kind and full of locals advice on where to explore to see the real NYC. He sets the bar high for other hosts to follow and I would definitely recommend him and his place to others.[QWERTY123]Great place with great instructions from Seth. Very comfortable place and private. Would go back there again next time I visit my son.[QWERTY123]It was my first Airbnb experience and I really enjoyed it.  Seth is a wonderful host.  Entire communication with him was perfect.  His apartment is very comfortable and you feel all the time that you are welcome there.  Seth always gives good advises about the bars and restaurants in the surrounding.  I really recommend this place. It has been a great stay.[QWERTY123]We had the best time staying in Seth's apartment. The room is great, and the apartment looks exactly like the photos. It is in a really good location,  perfect for exploring Williamsburg, but also really easy to get to Manhattan on the subway. Seth was super friendly and helpful, giving us loads of tips and recommendations. He was around whenever we wanted to ask questions, but generally we had the place to ourselves and had loads of privacy. I would 100% recommend Seth's apartment. Thanks Seth![QWERTY123]Seth provided us with all the service you could possibly think of. Exact descriptions on how to get into the apartment, recommendations about new york as well as the neighbourhood itself with all kinds of restaurants and bars. All in all we had a blast and i can only recommend staying at seth's! I know we would do it again![QWERTY123]It was a wonderful week in NYC. The department was exactly as advertised (the only thing not enough clear is the private bathroom you need to go out of the room and then enter the bathroom in front of the kitchen) the room was very nice. Seth provide with enough information about the surroundings and special activities (not the regular ones) 
We never seen Seth but this wasn't a problem, he always was in touch and he left us a phone with data and apps was very useful.

I recommend 100% Seth's place[QWERTY123]Awesome host and place!
The room and apartment is exactly as on photos, good location, and of course, Seth is great host. He provided us with lots of information and we truly felt at home.
Thanks a lot and definitely recommended!!![QWERTY123]Der Aufenthalt bei Seth war großartig. Bereits  im Vorfeld gab es ausführliche Kommunikation und daher war es sehr einfach zum Apartment zu finden und die Ankunft verlief problemlos. Das Apartment sieht genauso aus wie auf den Fotos und ist sehr sauber und gemütlich. Seth ist als Gastgeber sehr nett und hilfsbereit. Er hat mir sehr vielen Empfehlungen für Unternehmungen, Restaurants, etc gegeben und viele Informationen.  Das Apartment ist sehr gut gelegen, da es direkt um die Ecke eine Subway-Haltestelle gibt und einige Essensmöglichkeiten und einen Supermarkt. Ich würde definitiv einen Aufenthalt bei Seth weiterempfehlen.[QWERTY123]Seth was by far the most accommodating & helpful host I've stayed with! His home was extremely clean & welcoming. He even went above & beyond with suggestions to keep us entertained and well fed! Can't wait to visit New York again and definitely will be hoping to stay again! Thanks for the A++ experience![QWERTY123]Was a perfect experience! Loved Seth's place,  I think he has one of the most comfortable beds I have ever experienced in my life-which was wonderful after walking around so much....loved the location-so much to do around the area and the L line is a minute away....Seth and his girlfriend are so helpful, informative and warm-I'm definitely making this my go to place when in New York![QWERTY123]The listing understated the amount of space available, but was otherwise correct in every respect. The place is bright, clean, very modern, and located just one minute's walk from the nearest subway stop, on the L line, which connects to practically every line in Manhattan. Trains at 5-minute intervals and an average of 20 minutes to almost anywhere in downtown and midtown.

The ""virtual concierge"" system works fine: you don't get a key to the building's street entrance but you are always answered immediately and buzzed in in less than a minute. Four floors' worth of stairs, but the exercise is good for you.

Seth is the ideal host: friendly, helpful, but not too intrusive. I'd certainly stay again.

Gwynne[QWERTY123]Seth was the perfect host. He's very accommodating, great communication throughout the process, and very attentive.  The space is exactly as listed, if not better in person with a great location and Seth has some awesome lists of nearby favorite food and drink spots. Very comfortable bed and rooms, clean and nicely decorated. I felt very much at home here.[QWERTY123]Far and away the best airbnb experience I've yet to have! Seth was a wonderful host and the location couldn't be better. Comfortable bed, clean bathroom, great shower, privacy - all wonderful. This will be my go to spot whenever I'm in NYC.[QWERTY123]Seth's apartment was beautiful. Extremely comfortable and spacious, It's walking distance to most of my favorite Williamsburg spots, and you're in the city in minutes with the L train just outside the apartment. Seth was very attentive and accommodating, quick to respond to my messages throughout the entire stay.[QWERTY123]Seth's apartment was a great find.  My husband and I live in NYC but were looking for an extra room to crash in while we had family visiting for the holidays.  Seth's place was perfectly suited for our needs.  Seth was very responsive when we needed him and, although we saw him only two times, was very friendly and polite in person as well.  His apartment is conveniently located near a subway station and there are a lot of amenities nearby.[QWERTY123]What a wonderfully pleasant surprise! Accommodations exactly as pictured and described. Neat as a pin, spacious, and plenty of privacy. Seth is a gracious and informative host who made us feel right at home. Thanks so much ... we will definitely be back soon![QWERTY123]Seth is a great host, his flat is simply awesome. The city is really easy to access with the subway station really close. The neighbourhood is really cool to explore. I would recommend this place to anyone visiting the city and will stay there again if I have the chance.[QWERTY123]First of all Seth: Coolest host ever! Thank you for your help and suggestions. Really nice taste, which you can see in the interior of the apartment. It's so close to the subway, if it were closer the station would be in the kitchen. A great experience. I'll come back again.[QWERTY123]What can I write that hasn't already been written?  The apartment is clean, modern and comfortable.  Seth is attentive, concerned and affable.  Access was effortless and the bed was plush.

Of all of my AirBnB stays, this has to have been the most comprehensively well presented and managed one.  How can you argue with a heated toilet seat and a warm water bidet?  Great shower, too.[QWERTY123]
This was my first experience of Airbnb and an excellent start.  Seth was a great host - clear, detailed info prior to arrival and some great suggestions about things to do in the city.

The apartment is really well situated - literally round the corner from the L train into Manhattan (25 mins approx) and also handy for the fun of Williamsburg.  It's a couple of subway stops from the action of Bedford Avenue but there are restaurants and bars nearby and we felt close to everything we needed.

The room and apartment were very clean, comfortable and stylish, absolutely no complaints.
[QWERTY123]Seth was very prompt and communicated back and forth throughout my stay even though he was away traveling and my booking was last minute. Provided lots of good tips and recs for the area. His place is quite spacious and it was really nice having it all to myself (HUGE tv was a +). Seth clearly does this a lot and is well prepared for airbnb guests-- as he has a lot of guidelines/rules/expectations/manuals to read and answer all questions regarding the stay... which can be overwhelming if you're just looking for a quick place to crash for a few days. Overall the stay was pleasant and easy to get to/from Manhattan (short train ride away around the corner).[QWERTY123]Seth is such a nice, funny and helpful guy. His house is very well too... We enjoyed our stay. :))[QWERTY123]Seth's apartment was great and highly recommended.  Seth was in touch in advance with all the details we needed, and with loads of hints and tips to help us plan our trip.  When we met him at his apartment, he was a nice guy with loads of advice and really keen to help.  We only actually saw him twice when we were there, so it was like having our own apartment, but with a great tour guide attached!

The apartment was exactly as described, if anything it was a bit bigger.  It was really cool and I secretly want to buy my own pinball machine now.

The apartment was in a quiet residential street, but 30 seconds from the subway into Manhattan (which only took 10-15 mins) and loads of bars and restaurants.  The centre of Williamsburg with all the best bars and restaurants is about 20 mins walk away.

Overall, really recommended, we really enjoyed our 5 nights there.[QWERTY123]Seth's apartment is the best in Brooklyn! You will never know how great it is until you move in. Everything is perfect in the house. It's really better than described. In the house, it's 5-star-hotel decorated with a terrace, which you can see the Manhattan view in the distance.
Seth is so kind and hospitable. He actually cared for how I stay in his house and send me greetings by text message when he went for business trip.  And when I had got questions, he would give me a detailed suggestion. I really appreciated it.
About the surroundings, the subway is so close that you can walk to it in 30 seconds. There are a lot of groceries and restaurants around. And Williamsburg is a funny and safe community, which contains thousands of bars, cafes and restaurants. If I have chances to come back to New York City, I will definitely choose Seth's apartment again! Thanks Seth![QWERTY123]I had such a fantastic 2 weeks staying at Seth's. The place was better than expected, and the photos just don't do the place justice. 
Seth was friendly and hospitable. When I first arrived at the apartment, Seth and I had just missed each other. But to my surprise I found a couple of little notes that were absolutely delightful after my 22 hour flight - especially the caffeine one.
There was one night during my stay where Seth and his girlfriend Elsa asked me to join their chilli and Game of Thrones night with a couple of their friends. It was certainly a highlight to my stay. Especially the late night chat the 3 of us had.
As for the apartment. The place was very clean and modern. The bed was very comfortable. TV had all channels plus Netflix and other media apps. Remote controlled blinds that when opened showed magical views of the city. The apartment is literally around the corner from the Grand St subway, convenience stores and restaurants. Manhattan really was only 10 minutes by subway, which was a huge bonus. 
Highly recommend to anyone looking to stay in NYC. I'll be looking at Seth's place first on my next visit.[QWERTY123]This is my first time to try AirBNB and luckily I have a great experience! Seth residence is wonderful for all any aspects.The location is superb,just a few step to the Subway (L train) and it takes about 15 minutes to the center of NY and the nabourhood (Brooklyn) is my favorite place ,lots of cool and fun stuffs .The room is spacious,clean and tidy,bed is comfortable,the kitchen and restroom is modern and clean. Moreover,Seth is very nice  and polite ,we don't see each other much but he prepare everything for our convenience,He give us tea&coffee (also beer as welcome gift) and I really appreciate that he even lend us a new mobile phone with free wifi!! ,it's help us a lot to find everything in NY :) (Thank you for your kindness,Seth) 
I has no hesitation to suggest you to stay here if you need a good rest and great vacation!!![QWERTY123]Seth's home was stylishly presented, modern, clean and welcoming. We had everything a traveller could hope for in New York - a very thoughtful and helpful host, a private bedroom and bathroom, and the apartment was in a conveniently located and safe neighbourhood with excellent access to New York's subway system. We are glad that we chose to stay in Williamsburg/Brooklyn rather than in Manhattan.[QWERTY123]This place is fantastic. It truly is 5 stars across the board. It's one of the cleanest places you'll step foot in while in NYC. The size of his place is second to none with a fantastic rooftop to spend your evenings on. The location is within a mile of almost anywhere you'll want to go within Williamsburg (I highly suggest making a trip to Robertas for pizza and drinks, a 10 minute walk from Seth's place). Seth is an excellent host and has a great understanding of the city to provide suggestions on anything that you want to do.

The value that you receive on this particular AirBnB is undoubtedly the best value that you will find when searching for a place to stay in all of NYC. I highly suggest you making this your place to stay while visiting NYC.[QWERTY123]We had an excellent stay at Seth's apartment during our recent trip to NYC. Seth was a perfect host: quick to answer any questions, a wealth of information on what to see and do during our visit, and a great roommate, making us feel welcome and at home. He even loaned us a cellphone while we were there to spare us the international charges we would've otherwise been subject to, using our own international phone plans. We had a great time while we were there, thanks, in a big part, to Seth's hospitality. Thanks, Seth![QWERTY123]Seth's place is really great. It's in a cool area near bars/restaurants in both Bushwick and Williamsburg. Great location near the L. The rooftop patio had an amazing view of downtown. Seth had everything set up for us when we arrived including fresh towels and coffee in the morning.[QWERTY123]Seth's apartment is absolutely amazing! 
Seth was very careful to ensure everything was perfect for us.
We would definitely return upon another visit to NYC.
[QWERTY123]Seth went above and beyond anything I ever expected. He was so helpful, and really made my whole experience that much better. Location and apartment are lovely and just as described. Bed is comfy and shower is good too! Would love you come back here. Thanks Seth[QWERTY123]Clean, spacious and spitting distance to all that Brooklyn and Williamsburg has to offer. Centrally located next to a subway station and walking distance to Roberta's!! The space is accurately depicted in the descriptions and pictures. When Seth is around, he is upstairs in his private space and you have the run of the living room and can commandeer the pinball machine. Seth is knowledgeable about all things NYC and has a bunch of cool suggestions and tips that even a New Yorker would find interesting. Don't hesitate to book this place if you want to see where the cool kids live.[QWERTY123]Seth's place was great!  It was clean, quiet, roomy, and most importantly very comfortable.  Seth was a very welcoming host, and provided everything we needed to enjoy our stay.   Really recommend his place if you're looking for a convenient place in the center of it all.  Will definitely come back our next trip.[QWERTY123]Seth is my neighbor and we've just started using his apartment for our relatives. It's perfect for us as an affordable, clean, comfortable way to keep family nearby. Seth is an A++++ host.[QWERTY123]Seth is the quintessential host. He has every cable channel you can think of. The Casper mattress is amazing and I'm probably going to have to have one myself now (Thanks Seth). Everything was perfect and I highly  recommend staying here.[QWERTY123]We had an amazing stay with Seth, made the trip so easy by lending us a phone for the duration. The room was perfect, comfiest bed, TV with Netflix and everything else for the lazy nights and a private balcony. Bathroom was amazing with a heated toilet seat and bidet!!!! Didn't see him much as we were all busy but replied instantly whenever we got in touch with exactly what we needed. Would definitely stay again, if you want a little slice of home comforts in the big city stay here ♡[QWERTY123]Seth was a really great host even I didn't have a chance to meet him. He provided me a mobile phone which can access the data such as internet, map.. etc. during my stay.  Seth's place is amazing and being as a pictures shown.[QWERTY123]Seth went above and beyond to make sure my stay st his house was comfortable. He was so flexible, which was amazing given my changing schedule. The apartment is beautiful, especially the downstairs bathroom. Thank you Seth!!!![QWERTY123]Seths apartment was beautiful and in such a fantastic location, the subway to the city is so easy to use. Seth is a lovely  host and couldn't be more helpful. Definitely a good pick![QWERTY123]I stayed for 5days. The house is look so same to pic and It's really close to subway station. Seth is great host and His answer is very fast, so if he doesn't in house, i could solve the question about the stay :) thanks!![QWERTY123]Seth's place was a breath of fresh air. Truly, a getaway in itself in many regards. He has considered every detail in the space and leaves you with no questions. This home, the set up, and the area were exactly as described and the hospitality Seth exhibited was really impeccable. Amongst countless styles of accomodation, this was one of the most comfortable, hospitable, and welcoming experiences I've ever had.[QWERTY123]Seth's place is fabulous! Everything from check in to check out is smooth! His instructions were all crystal clear. Very accomodating and he even lend us a phone with unlimited data which is very helpful to us coz we need to check places we want to visit. We just (Hidden by Airbnb) the location and we're good to go! He went out of town so the entire place during our stay was basically ours. His place is close to nice restaurants, pizza place, grocery shop and the subway (L Train) Safe neighborhood and very convenient! Oh, the bed is soo comfy too! Definitely more than worth it for the price you paid! Thanks Seth![QWERTY123]Our stay in New York was fantastic. Seth was very helpful providing us with an American phone to help us get around, a huge list of recommended places and was always quick to answer any other questions we had. The apartment was lovely and we had all the privacy we needed, with subway so close by it was a perfect location. Highly recommended.[QWERTY123]Our stay in New York was awesome! Seth's place is great, everything you'd expect and more. He even gave us an American cellphone to take around with us so we wouldn't rack up data or calling charges on our out-of-country phones. Very thoughtful! Super close to subway, very easy to get around. Would highly recommend. Thanks Seth![QWERTY123]We stayed at Seth’s place for three nights and had a great time! The décor is modern and the photographs are a true reflection of the apartment (albeit the bedroom seems slightly smaller in reality but that’s not really an issue). The apartment is conveniently located - literally 30 seconds from the Subway with quick access to Manhattan. Seth was extremely helpful, always responding very quickly to messages and providing excellent suggestions. He also provided us with a phone to use during our stay and I cannot stress how invaluable this was. Don’t hesitate to stay here![QWERTY123]It was my second trip to NYC and my second time staying at Seth´s appartement. Seth was a great host. The appartement is very clean and comfortable. The subway is directly around the corner. Seth gave me a cellular phone to take around with me. Thank Seth!!! I think I will visit NYC again and I hope to stay in your appartement again.[QWERTY123]This was my first trip to New York and my first time using Air BNB. Both were amazing! The pictures of the apartment do not serve it justice. Everything was very clean and felt like home. Seth did an amazing job staying in contact and making sure everything went as smoothly as possible. He is very detailed with the ins and outs of staying at his apartment which made they stay even easier. There are better amenities than most hotels have. Free wifi, Netflix, hulu, and much more. The subway is very close to the apartment so that made it easier for us to get to and from manhattan (especially for us first time subway riders). Overall it was a great experience and I would recommend this apartment to anyone. If I could give him 6 stars I would :)[QWERTY123]This was a great place to stay. It was clean, quiet, and comfortable and very close to where we needed to be.[QWERTY123]Seth is a wonderful host who takes the perfect care of his visitors. His appartment - which is just as described on airbnb - is stilishly designed, meticulously clean and and island of peace in busy NY. It is a great homebase to explore the various Brooklyn neighbourhoods on foot, but also the L train to manhattan takes just a few minutes. We would definitely come again - highly recommended![QWERTY123]This place is great!! The bed and sheets are so comfortable, the shower is great, the little egg shaped thing in the room is super comfortable, the kitchen is perfectly equipped and if you don't feel like cooking, the subway couldn't be closer to get you anywhere you want. The neighborhood is lovely and perfectly safe. 
The host is a really nice guy who's ready to answer all your nyc questions. He even gave us a really good phone with unlimited data to take with us on our visits through the city. 
Definitely would recommend this place to anyone looking for a nice place in Williamsburg.[QWERTY123]I will definitely recommend Seth's place to anyone who's looking to have a trip in NYC. 
He provided very detailed description on the area as well as information to get to his place. Since we also shopped quite a bit in Woodbury, Seth allowed us to store our luggages in the living room. He was very accomodating to our requests and gave us advice when we needed.[QWERTY123]We LOVED our stay at Seth's place!  Everything was perfect inside the apartment, and Seth had clear communication for our arrival, stay, and departure.  The subway being so close is invaluable, and it was very easy to explore Williamsburg and the surrounding Brooklyn neighborhoods.  Seth has a great guide for things to do within Brooklyn and in Manhattan.  It can seem overwhelming to come to NYC, but these tips made it much more manageable.  Although we never even saw Seth because we were so busy, he was easily accessible via email or text, so we would have been able to reach him quickly if we needed anything.  We had a great experience and would definitely recommend staying here to anyone![QWERTY123]Seth's place was great and exactly what we needed for a site seeing visit. The Subway is as close as described and was super easy to get everywhere! We were greeted by Seth's girlfriend Friday night which was very kind as we didn't get there until 10pm. The bed is amazing which made sleeping incredibly easy and the neighbourhood is quiet. We stayed pretty much in our room when at Seth's but felt we had our own space with Seth and his girlfriend being based upstairs. The flat is a great base when seeing other areas. Great trip and stay![QWERTY123]Seth's place is highly recommended. Steps from the L train, close to great Williamsburg night life and restaurants, and if that's not enough, the L gets you right into Manhattan. The  private bathroom and room with balcony are amazing, not to mention WiFi and satellite TV when you need a rest (we did after a few days). Seth is a great host, very responsive.[QWERTY123]It was a great stay in Seth's house. The place is gorgeous and very stylish. The living room and the TVs equipped with netflix and hulu in the living room and the guest room were awesome. Seth was a lovely host who also gave me a phone for navigation and calls.  He also gave some great tips and provided two great guides for travelling around New York which were very helpful. However, the apartment is on 4th floor and there is no elevator, so you have to carry your luggages through the stairs by yourself.[QWERTY123]Clean and modern 
Great location
Very friendly host easily and readily available if you need him.
Safe secure private. Good place to stay for 1 person.[QWERTY123]Seth's place is at a fantastic location, walking distance to the subway (3 mins!) and going to Manhattan is so easy.  The place is very nice and we recommend it to anyone!

Parking is a bit difficult as the street gets filled up by around 7pm. But subway is so easy.[QWERTY123]Seth and his apartment are wonderful! This is a great home base to Williamsburg and Bushwick. Seth had excellent recommendations for food to check out near the apartment. The neighborhood itself is packed with art, bars and good-value food — lots of local flavor. You can walk east for a few minutes and be in the middle of Bushwick’s mural art collective.

Seth is among the friendliest Airbnb hosts I have encountered. He was responsive over messenger, and it was clear he wanted his guest to have a happy stay in NYC. The room has plenty of privacy - was easy to enter and leave without disturbing Seth at all. Thank you Seth![QWERTY123]Seth's apartment is a top notch listing in east Williamsburg. It's bright, spacious and clean and you could forgiven for thinking it would be loud but it's amazingly quiet. You can see the lights of manhattan from the balcony on a clear night. It's so close to the subway and you can be in manhattan in under 15 minutes while staying in a hip Brooklyn neighbourhood. I felt very at home during my stay. Seth has gone to a lot of trouble to make detailed guidebooks of very 'new york' things to do that you won't find in the TripAdvisor top 10. In my free time I literally did every one of his recommendations and they made my trip that much more special. Even visiting the bars he suggested made me feel like a local. Hosts like Seth are what make Airbnb an authentic experience, not just a place to stay. 5 stars![QWERTY123]Seth and Elsa have a beautiful and very well-appointed home in the heart of a young and lively neighborhood with tons of things to do and see. Willy-burg is one of the hippest areas in all of NYC and for those seeking out cool cafes, bars, restaurants and tony boutique ships you will not be disappointed. It was very easy for me to navigate the area on foot and on bike (rented those ubiquitous blue CITI bikes). Seth's apt itself is in a quiet residential area of the neighborhood and I slept very well. The subway station is literally a 1-min walk away if that. The L train puts you to the LES and the East Village of Manhattan in a NY minute :) I was very pleased with my stay at Seth's place and I am so grateful he was willing to share his luxurious oasis in the city with us travelers. Thank you Seth![QWERTY123]Staying at Seth's was great! Seth went above and beyond to make my stay run perfectly, he is really a veteran Airbnb host - and that makes all the difference when you're visiting a new city.

I highly recommend Seth's place to all who stop by New York![QWERTY123]I had a great time staying with Seth in Brooklyn. The apartment is great and exactly as advertised. The neighborhood is also great with excellent walkable bars, restraints, and right next to the subway. I would definitely stay here again. Thanks Seth![QWERTY123]The room and space are as spacious and comfortable and beautifully decorated as the photos and other reviews suggest. The view from the bedroom is city magic. It was winter when I voided but I'm sure the balcony is even more of a delight in good weather. Comfortable bed, gorgeous bathroom, and very private.

And yet, interacting with Seth and Elsa is perhaps the best part. They are New Yorkers in the truest sense: witty, great taste, fun-loving and kind. Can't recommend highly enough.[QWERTY123]Seth Place is true to the ad and is situated in a great location; close to little shops, restaurants and best of all, the subway which takes you into Manhattan.  Seth's apartment is very comfy (very comfy bed too), clean and welcoming.  Seth is a wonderful host, he makes sure that you are doing ok and always asks if there is something else he can help you with.[QWERTY123]Seth was the friendliest host and was readily available to answer any questions and provide numerous suggestions. Checking in and out was seamless. The private bathroom furnished with a bidet and rainfall shower were a huge comfort, especially after an arduous day exploring the city. The L train to Manhattan was conveniently located just around the corner.[QWERTY123]I had a great stay at Seth's place. It felt like a home away from home. He and Elsa made me feel welcomed from the moment I met them. They're awesome people. 

The location offers very convenient access to the subway which can get you everywhere. The location also gives you a feel of what daily life is truly like for locals living in the NYC area. Seth also recommended some great areas to check out which helped me as I was looking for places to have coffee, dine, etc. 

This was one of my best AirBnB experiences to date. If you have the chance to stay here, don't think twice, book it. You'll be very glad you did. I certainly will look to stay again on my next trip to NYC.[QWERTY123]Great place. Great location. Great host.[QWERTY123]Great place to stay, nice neighborhood and Seth is a very good host.  Would def stay again in future.
[QWERTY123]Great stay at a unique place. Seth was a wonderful host![QWERTY123]Great place and the location for a Williamsburg experience plus access to Manhattan couldn't be better. Super friendly hosts who are around more than you might expect, but this was only an advantage/positive bonus.[QWERTY123]Seth was an excellent host.  His place is very clean and comfortable.  He provided us with several great recommendations for food, bars, fun things to do, and best ways to get around the city.  We would stay with him again.  Thanks Seth![QWERTY123]Seth was a wonderful host. Full of tips and tricks that helped make our trip even better. I highly recommend staying if you want to get to know New York like a local. We had a very comfortable stay in this great flat in a great location.[QWERTY123]Very convenient location! Very quite to sleep! Would definitaly recomend![QWERTY123]Cool, convenient and clean.  5*[QWERTY123]Had a great time a this apartment. It was very clean and spacious. Would certainly recommend the apartment  and it's location to anyone looking for a more local experience of NYC.[QWERTY123]If your looking at staying in Brooklyn, NY - look no further! Seth's apartment is well located, has a huge space and comfortable bed! Seth is a great host, who has great knowledge of New York and all of its hidden beauties! I wish I could have spent more time in Brooklyn to check out more of his recommendations! We hope to be back and stay here again soon :)[QWERTY123]Bon séjour chez Seth.[QWERTY123]We had a great time at Seth's appartment! The location is close to almost everything. A considerable advantage is all recommandations given by Seth. And if you have any additional questions, jusk ask as it's really easy to communicate with him! I would definitely recommend![QWERTY123]Seth's apartment is situated in a fabulous location in Brooklyn and great for exploring areas outside of Manhattan as well as 3 minutes from the subway L line which takes you directly into 14th St/Union Square. Seth left very helpful notes for getting around his neighbourhood, recommendations for places to eat and hang out and things to do which was really useful. Check in was very easy but please remember that there is no lift upto his apartment which is on the 4th floor (im thinking about heavy bags or cases). The apartment is clean, light and airy but relaxed and comfortable at the same time.  We would recommend staying with him if the apartment is available![QWERTY123]Rundum eine sehr gute Erfahrung. Sehr netter Gastgeber mit guter Kommunikation zu allen wichtigen Punkten. Fühlte mich sofort wie zuhause. Sehr gute Anbindung an die U-Bahn. Nicht allzu weit draußen. Die Beschreibungen von Seth sind sehr gut und entsprechen den Begebenheiten. Für New Yorker Verhältnisse sehr sauber und modern. Absolut empfehlenswert, würde sofort wieder buchen.[QWERTY123]Perfekter Host, hat uns immer unterstützt und stand uns mit Rat und Tat zur Seite. Nachbarschaft war sehr gut, wir waren super schnell in Manhatten!! Retaurant Tipps von Seth waren überragend! Es war sehr sauber und angenehm temperiert. Wir werden auf jedenfall wieder zu Seth kommen und ihn weiterempfehlen![QWERTY123]Lovely apartment in a great neighbourhood. Loved it.[QWERTY123]Seth was an amazing host for my stay in New York. After booking, Seth sent detailed and helpful instructions on how to get to the location as well as recommendations for local attractions.

Seth's apartment was very clean. The bed was comfortable, and everything looks just like the pictures.

 Seth was always available for any questions and was extremely friendly and helpful. If I return to New York, I will definitely at Seth's apartment again![QWERTY123]Seth worked with me to set up my stay after I'd made a mistake in the booking and was extremely responsive and helpful. The place was great and, while i was in the city on business, the location was perfect for my friend to discover Williamsburg & Greenpoint![QWERTY123]This being my first time using AirBnB I could not have. Asked for a better host. Seth was simply awesome. Upon arrival I was greeted and shown around his amazing place. Everything was exactly as described and even better in person. 
Seth also gave me some recommendations on places around the Williamsburg area that were spot on for what I wanted to do. All in all 10/10 experience.[QWERTY123]Seth and his girlfriend are super nice![QWERTY123]It was super easy to find and in a safe neighborhood. Everything was very clean and was the best home away from home.[QWERTY123]Seth is an awesome host!
We had a great time at his place.
Everything is near from L line subway and we could reach anything in minutes.
Bedroom has total privacy and Seth make us very comfortable!
[QWERTY123]Seth was an excellent if not a perfect host. The communication was fast and easy. His tips (including his guidebooks) on anything related to NY were so helpful that basically all you had to do was to follow what Seth advised. The location is just perfect: a subway station is literally around the corner and you can get to any location of NY, the neighborhood is quiet and safe. The room is neat and the bed is comfortable. A private bathroom with all amenities you might need. Perfect for a sole traveler and a couple.[QWERTY123]I had a great experience staying here. The apartment is right around the corner from the subway station, making it very easy to get around Brooklyn and into Manhattan. The bedroom was very comfortable and private; I never met the host and really felt like I had the place to myself. Seth's notes and recommendations were a really nice touch. 10/10![QWERTY123]The host has detailed instructions for check in and a notebook full great suggestions for local and non-local places to explore. The room and bathroom were very clean.  As we were out early and back late we never met the host. We wish we had in order to thank him in person! Highly recommend.[QWERTY123]Seth's perfect privacy getaway come just as promised. Beautiful no matter time time of day, dimmers adorn lights switches helping to set very relaxing moods. The terrance and deck are prefect for catching some sun or nap if the softness from the bed doesn't suck you in and threaten to never let you go. I could go on and on about how great Seth's home was but you'll only truly know once you stop by.[QWERTY123]We had a great stay at Seth's place and highly recommend it. The listing is accurate - spacious apartment with everything you might need. 2 mins from L train so easy subway ride to union square and about 15 min walk to Bedford Ave. Seth has clearly been hosting for a while and has it down to a tee - the instructions and guidebooks are well thought out and make for a straightforward check in and check out. He has loads of suggestions for things to do, good restaurants and bars in the vicinity - especially perfect if you've already done the main NYC attractions. Seth and Elsa were accessible and made sure everything was going well and happy to answer questions and give good suggestions. Thank you![QWERTY123]Super handy location to the subway, it's only two minutes away. From there you're in the city within a few stops and also not far from the hustle and bustle of Bedford Avenue. I felt safe, as a solo traveller this trip, walking to the apartment from the subway after midnight. Seth & Elsa were friendly and helpful hosts, offering suggestions for shopping and sightseeing. The apartment and facilities were clean and tidy. The bed was super comfy, wish I could pack that in my suitcase ha ha. I would highly recommend this place to stay, I would definitely stay again.[QWERTY123]We are very satisfied with our five days in Seth's apartment in Williamsburg. His upfront information about the apartment, neighborhood and NYC was extremely precise and very helpful. We are however glad we chose the airtrain/subway from JFK. That made us well prepared to carry our suitcases up to the apartment on the fourth floor. Highly recommendable![QWERTY123]Seth’s place is such a super find! It is a stunning penthouse apartment right in the middle of Williamsburg. So close to the L subway station, we could get in to Manhattan and back without a hitch! Seth is a great host. Very easy to talk to and very responsive to questions. The room is kept so clean and it’s nice and quiet when you are in the room. We would definitely stay here again in the future.[QWERTY123]My husband and I (mid-forties) stayed with Seth & Elsa for about 10 Days and thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. Seth’s home is a two story apartment as described. Seth communicated quickly even when I peppered him with questions. 
The only access is via a couple of flights of stairs, but as Seth joked this is what’s known as a New York Gym :) Ordinarily check-in would be easy, but I wasn’t well and mucked up my check-in without thinking. Seth was very kind and forgiving about this. 
One of the great things about this apartment is that you get the use of a bathroom, kitchen and loungeroom. Seth’s bathroom is upstairs. 
Seth is around, but he is a busy person and not in your face. In fact we would have been happy to see more of he & Elsa, they are  interesting people, so we had some good banter and conversations with them. 
The bed is comfy and the room size is ample. Electric blinds in the bedroom were handy. 
Transportation is convenient from here as the subway is around the corner, only a minute or so to walk there! We easily accessed other parts of Williamsburg by walking, but once at Union Square - (only a few stops away) you change trains to almost anywhere you want to go in NYC! We recommend the weekly pass, which at $32USD was amazing value. ($1 fee to set up the card, but it can be reloaded if you stay more than a week.)
We enjoyed the food. At Seth’s suggestion, we tried Lily Thai. Authentic Thai food. They don’t make it hot, so ask for extra if you like it spicy. If you are looking for an easy meal when you arrive (while its not my favourite) there is a Subway & a Maccas around the corner from the apartment.
Overall this apartment is clean, generous in space and a convenient location close to transport. Host is great, highly recommended![QWERTY123]Thanks to Seth & Elsa for being great hosts! Their place is true to what is advertised. Great location in Williamsburg! So close to the Subway which was excellent when commuting to & from Manhattan! We ate at some great places as recommended by Seth which meant we got to experience the local hotspots not featured in the usual highlight lists. Seth’s place is nice, modern & clean! Very comfy bed! They also gave us plenty of space so we didn’t feel like we were living in someone else’s home most of the time. 
I would definitely recommend especially if you’re wanting to also see Brooklyn as well as Manhattan. I was travelling with my Mum (60) who struggled a little with all of those stairs up to the apartment so maybe keep this in mind if you’re a bit older or are travelling with older family or friends! I didn’t mind the stairs, afterall they do call it the NY gym! Thanks again :-)[QWERTY123]The apartment is handily located a couple of minutes walk away from the subway and in a decent non touristy location with plenty of food and drink options within walking distance. It is about 20-30 mins walk away from the main Williamsburg area. It's a direct train into Manhattan but be aware for certain destinations (e.g. main museums/Central Park) where you have to change lines it is over 30mins on the subway. We had all the amenities we needed in the compact bedroom and bed was super comfy. Seth and Elsa were very accommodating and easily contacted.[QWERTY123]Seth was a wonderful host! The perfect combination of helpful and 'make-yourself-at-home'. Seth's style is sophisticated and interesting. Loved it. I felt comfortable right away. He is incredibly responsive and seemed very comfortable sharing his space. I felt like I had the entire place even though I was in a downstairs bedroom and had a private bath. Very clean. I appreciated having to take my shoes off when entering the space. I would hate to bring the city streets into this beautiful space. Conveniently located to the L train, I was able to get into Manhattan in less that 15 minutes. Late night returning to the apartment felt safe, as well. Super easy to get around due to the proximity of the train. Uber was easy. $30 trip to LaGuardia (with some traffic).  Seth offered all sorts of tips about what to see and where to go. I lived in NYC for 20 years, so I knew my way around. I had a great time thanks to Seth's hospitality and the location. It is a four floor walk up - which got me in shape for the metro stairwells. If you have heavy baggage, be ready! I would definitely stay here again! Thanks so much, Seth![QWERTY123]Excellent host! Excellent guidebook! Thanks, Seth![QWERTY123]The place is great, very comfortable and well-located. Seth is an outstanding host, exceptionally responsive and obviously committed to making his guests comfortable. We greatly enjoyed our time there.[QWERTY123]Seth was a fantastic host. He was detailed in everything information we need and was really prompt in all of his replies. It was unfortunate that we were not able to meet Seth, still he was prompt when we have questions and often check in on us just to make sure we settled in well. As for his place, real to the photos and location was fantastic! Steps away from Subway L and as a Singaporean living in a tiny island and spoilt in distance in accessing to places, trust me when I say near and steps away. Many places for food, medical, necessities and coffee just around the area. My partner and I will definitely recommend Seth's place and will definitely choose his apartment if we ever visit NYC again.[QWERTY123]Seth is an unbelievable host and his apartment was perfect for our stay! The place is perfectly set up for guests, with the bedroom and bathroom right near the door so you can come and go as you please. We had our own space and freedom of use of the bathroom and Seth was very welcoming in terms of allowing us use of the whole downstairs area (he sleeps upstairs so living, dining and kitchen was also available). 
Very quick with responding which was great for the lead up to our stay. Every little touch was well thought out and planned from a guest’s point of view, ensuring we had the best stay possible. 
The guide he has taken the time to write out is fantastic and there is so much info in there and tips and ideas for what to do, you will need months just to get through them all! Plenty of storage space, can’t think of anything else we needed that wasn’t provided. 
The blockout blinds were a welcome touch and the BED... my god, I am so fussy when it comes to beds and I was not disappointed- comfiest I have slept on and I have lower back and shoulder pain to think of. The jet lag hit me really badly while I was there, so I was truly grateful for both of those items. 
Thanks in particular for organising it to snow while we were there- the connections you have must be amazing 
It is a fourth floor apartment so you will be climbing stairs- please take note - we knew this when we booked. Please don’t complain about it. It’s common in New York and it balances out the tasty food you will undoubtedly eat when there. Also if this is a surprise to you, you should have really read the details because it’s mentioned several times.
The area itself was lovely with some great food options and we did a big walk of the neighbourhood to check it out and it felt safe and friendly. If anything, quieter than usual because of the weather. Subway literally around the corner and AMAZING bagels and coffee at The Standard cafe. 10/10 recommend. Thanks Seth![QWERTY123]Nice place and well situated. Seth was a great host.[QWERTY123]Great location, convenient to the subway and a beautiful apartment.  This is a great place to stay, and at a very reasonable price.[QWERTY123]Good location, very nice host and a comfortable apartment.[QWERTY123]I would highly recommend this lovely apartment for anyone visiting New York.

Seth has an absolutely wonderful space that is well located in a great part of Brooklyn, but it is really close to the Subway so that you can easily access Manhatten. The amenities are excellent and exactly as pictured - the shower is lovely, bed is comfy and there are great TVs if you fancy a chilled night in. 

Seth gave us lots of space and was barely there during our stay. He gave us some very helpful hints to the city and he was always on hand for help. He accommodated our date changes and early check in with ease. Everything was easy and he was so relaxed.

Overall, we absolutely loved staying in Seth's apartment. It was great to get out of Manhatten and experience a different neighbourhood with some fantastic restaurants! 10/10[QWERTY123]I would highly recommend Seth's apartment to anyone visiting New York. The location is perfect and it really is very convenient being so close to the Subway. The apartment itself is very cool, spacious and clean and so it was perfect for those mornings/evenings when we wanted to stay in. Seth was a great host and very quick to communicate anything relevant to our stay. 10/10 - would definitely come back, thanks Seth![QWERTY123]Seth was incredibly helpful and responsive, making the stay very easy and stress-free. The apartment is very large by New York standards and well appointed. It was the perfect place to come back to after a long day running around in the city. As mentioned in other reviews, you can’t beat the proximity to the subway. Thanks, Seth![QWERTY123]Wir waren leider etwas enttäuscht von der Wohnung. Auf den Bildern wirkt die Wohnung heller und einladender als es zu unserem Aufenthalt vorzufinden war. Der Check in verlief reibungslos. Der Kühlschrank war anfangs vollgeladen mit Produkten, so dass wir uns selbst zuerst etwas Platz machen mussten. Man sollte speziell bei der Größe des Kühlschranks schon erwarten dürfen, dass man einen eigenen Bereich im Kühlschrank frei geräumt bekommt, wenn man als Gast eintrifft. Nach Rücksprache mit Seth wurde uns durch seine Freundin etwas Platz freigeräumt. Im Tiefkühlfach war leider immer noch sehr wenig Platz vorhaden, so dass wir gar nicht auf den Gedanken kamen dies zu nutzen. Jemand der sich gerne Pizza oder Tiefkühlprodukte gerne zubereitet hätte, hätte hier Probleme gehabt. Da fühlte man sich schon etwas unwillkommen. Auch im Badezimmer gab es kaum Platz um private Kosmetiksachen abzustellen. Das Regal war voll mit Produkten der Eigentümer. 

Die Aussicht die hier als ""Killer Aussicht"" betitelt wird war unspektakulär. Man schaut zuerst auf diverse unschöne Hinterhöfe und auch die Aussicht auf die Skyline war sehr beschränkt. Man musste sich schon sehr am Rande des Balkons aufhalten um die Skyline gut sehen zu können. 

Seth in der ganzen Zeit unseres Aufenthalts beruflich verhindert, so dass wir ihn nicht getroffen haben. Jedoch war er immer schnell per Nachricht zu erreichen. Über die Nachrichten war er sehr bemüht, dass wir uns wohl fühlen. 

Uns war bewusst dass wir Treppen laufen müssen, aber es war doch sehr arg hoch und speziell der letzte Abschnitt zur Wohnungstür hat sich sehr gezogen. Auch gab es keinen Schlüssel für die Eingangstür unten. Man musste jedes mal klingeln, bis ein virtueller Türöffner einem die Tür öffnet. Dieser Beauftragte sitzt irgendwo anders und fragt jedes mal nach den Namen und was man hier möchte. Wir fanden es als nervig und etwas kompliziert.

Positiv hat uns gefallen, dass die Wohnung sehr nah an der U-bahn Station ist. Man benötigt keine drei Minuten vom Ausstieg aus der Bahn bis zur unteren Eingangstür. Das Wohnzimmer war schön eingerichtet und man hatte dort auch einen großen Fernseher, auf dem man morgens das Frühstückfernsehen einschalten konnte und sich über akteulle Nachrichten in New York informieren konnte. Das Bett war gemütlich, jedoch war das Schlafzimmer etwas klein für zwei Personen und sehr schlicht eingerichtet. 
Es gab mehrere Möglichkeiten um sich Kaffee zu machen was wir auch als sehr positiv begrüßt haben. 

Insgesamt finde ich den Preis von 985€ für eine Woche zu hoch angesetzt. Wir waren auch in zwei anderen Airbnb Wohnungen in New York untergebracht. In diesen anderen Wohnungen haben wir für unsere zweite Woche gerade mal die Hälfte bezahlt. Haben so mehr Eindrücke von New York und den weiteren Stadtvierteln erhalten und haben uns auch nicht unwohler gefühlt als in dieser Wohnung. Jede Wohnung hat seine positiven Aspekte gehabt. Im Großen und Ganzen kann ich die Wohnung zu dem Preis von 985€ für eine Woche nicht empfehlen.[QWERTY123]Seth’s communication was spot on our whole stay.  Would stay there again.  Subway access is super close and a must for this city :).[QWERTY123]Staying in the apartment of Seth is like living in New York instead of being a tourist. He is very polite and helpfull, but gives you also all the space and freedom you need. I really felt at home. 
By the way: the appartment is perfectly located, close to the subway and in a quiet neighbourhood (with some nice places to eat and have coffee with the 'locals').[QWERTY123]Seth's place is fantastic - clean, comfortable and a few steps away from the L line to Manhattan. Seth is super knowledgable about cool things to do/see/eat in NYC and he is very responsive to texts/emails/airbnb messages. His place had everything you needed to be comfortable - nice bedding, closet space, adjacent bathroom, etc... I would highly recommend staying with Seth in Brooklyn - you won't be disappointed![QWERTY123]Seth's appartement is zeer dichtbij de L metro, waarmee je op ongeveer een kwartier in Manhattan zit en op een half uur van Central Park.  Seth is zeer gastrvij en helpt je graag met tips over lokale bars en restaurants. Het complete appartement is zeer groot (naar New York standaards) en bestaat uit 2 verdiepen.  De laagste verdieping situeert zich op de 4e verdieping en bestaat uit de slaapkamer waarin jij slaapt, de badkamer, die je voor zichzelf hebt en de keuken en living die je deelt met Seth en zijn vriendin. De bovenste verdieping wordt exclusief door Seth en zijn vriendin gebruikt en daar verblijven ze ook het meest. De enige toegang tot het appartement, bestaande uit de 2 verdiepen, ligt op de laagste verdieping tussen jouw slaapkamer en de badkamer. Er is geen lift.  

Je kan niet van je slaapkamer naar de badkamer zonder even langs de gedeelde ruimtes te moeten lopen. Je moet dus best ""zedig"" gekleed zijn om naar de badkamer te kunnen.  

De opslagruimte in de slaapkamer zelf is beperkt. We konden onze kleren voor onze 10-daagse trip niet in de voorziene opbergruimte kwijt. Onze lege koffers mochten we wel in de living plaatsen. 

De slaapkamer zelf is nogal klein en niet zo goed verlucht.  Zeker bij warm weer kan het 's nachts heet en muf worden. Je kan dit oplossen door de raam open te zetten, maar dan hoor je het straatlawaai wel heel hard. Waarvoor Seth ook een oplossing heeft: een apparaat dat een monotoon geluid maakt dat nog luider is dan alle andere geluiden samen...  :-)

Al bij al een zeer geslaagde locatie bij heel vriendelijke, gastvrije en eerlijke mensen.[QWERTY123]We had a lovely time at Seth’s apartment. From the first interaction, he was responsive and helpful with tips/guides to ensure we have the best possible stay. Aside from the welcoming aesthetic of the place, I appreciated the level of privacy and positive interactions we had throughout. Would definitely stay at Seth’s next time in nyc! Thanks so much![QWERTY123]Seth’s place was in a great location close to transportation which is a plus. He is really good with communication and gives great hospitality.[QWERTY123]Seth was one of the most detail oriented hosts I've ever seen. He makes sure you have everything you need for a enjoyable stay and is always quick to respond when you have any concerns. Highly recommend[QWERTY123]Great and very comfortable place - very conveniently located; and the privacy you get is not overstated. Seth is also very responsive which is perfect. It's overall a great experience. Definitely recommend.[QWERTY123]This stay was everything I could hope for and I would recommend staying with Seth.[QWERTY123]Awesome place! The place is very comfortable and clean, Seth and Elsa are wonderful, and the location is fantastic - outside of the bustle of the city, but on the L train which is accessible to everything. Definitely stay here![QWERTY123]Seth gave great suggestions for dining out[QWERTY123]Could not get a better location. A couple of minutes from the L line sub way station Grand Street with a 15min journey in total to Union Square on Manhattan. A quiet hideaway with food stores nearby. Seth responded straight away. All good! Everything we needed.[QWERTY123]Seth went above and beyond on explaining everything and gave me tips about where to go and all the cool places .. definitely a great host[QWERTY123]Great place.[QWERTY123]Seth is really a super host.
He shows great experience in hosting people, is really flexible and accurate in everything and leaves you all the privacy you need while being there all the time if you need.
the house is very well located for a quick journey to Manhattan and access to the apartment is very well organized.
also there is a high level attention to details in the apartment.
thank you Seth, we had a great time[QWERTY123]Seth was very attentive and friendly. He gave some nice recommendations on places to explore in the neighborhood. Good host![QWERTY123]Great appartment in a good size for two people. The price is realistique for what you get. We stayed in New York for 9 nights - so therefor it was perfect to stay outside of Manhatten. If you have only 3-4 nights in New York I would have prefered to stay on the Manhatten side-you reach easier a lot of attractions. But the subway is really around the corner. 
We got a lot of information before our trip- that was very nice.
We had a good stay
Betina and Bjørn[QWERTY123]Seth’s Place was excellent. We loved all the amenities and convenience of the apartment. Seth was lovely and accommodating. 

We would definitely stay again![QWERTY123]If you are looking for the perfect place to explore NYC stop looking right now as you have found it! Seth’s place is steps away from Grand St station which takes you to everything you want to see in Manhattan within minutes. The area is excellent and very safe with great food and drink options nearby. The apartment was sparkling clean and Seth is an extremely helpful host who is always willing to point you in the right direction if you need some tips. The room is a very good size and has every amenity you could (Website hidden by Airbnb) Netflix, fan, balcony, white noise machine....ect. The apartment is super quiet, you wouldn’t know you were in NYC. Would definitely stay here again.[QWERTY123]Comfortable stay ,close to subway and great local restaurants and bars.[QWERTY123]Seth’s place was AWESOME! I would 100% recommend booking his place. It was perfect for our needs while exploring NYC/Brooklyn for the first time. Seth’s attention to detail and instructions are super helpful for a first timer in NYC.[QWERTY123]Seth’s place was perfect. So easy to get to, and into Manhattan. Would definitely recommend you stay in Brooklyn rather than Manhattan. Seth was a great host and thoughtfully provided great tips and suggestions. We had a brilliant stay![QWERTY123]This was one of the best air b’n’bs I have ever had. You couldn’t ask for a more gracious host!  Seth helps with all the details. From checking in to finding all the local hotspots. He always took time out of his day to make sure we were comfortable and to answer any questions we had no matter how big or small. This is a place I highly recommend to anyone looking to stay in Brooklyn. I know I’ll be staying here again!

Seth thanks again![QWERTY123]Great time staying at Seth’s place. Lots of good suggestions for things to do and very quick responses."	40.713318359663155	-73.94177265730093	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/24143	2	101.0	0.833333
82	11708	"We really enjoyed our stay.  The apartment was nice and clean.  It was nice to have a little more space to settle into since we were staying for five days.  Silvia was very helpful and able to recommend great places to eat and visit.  The location is great as it is in a fun neighborhood and an easy ride to the city.[QWERTY123]Silvia was a great host.  She provides a map of the Bushwick area and is very knowledgeable concerning the neighborhood.  She's always around in case of emergencies but leaves you alone to do your thing.  Would rent again.[QWERTY123]We had a great time in New York.  Thanks for putting us up Sylvia!  The apartment is cute, and as advertised and access to the L and JMZ was very convenient.  Sylvia provided us a great map of local things to do--we only wish we had more time to enjoy everything.  Tea each night, a little light reading from ""Broken Land"" and the comfortable accommodations were the perfect respite after long days of sightseeing. We'd stay there again![QWERTY123]We stayed six nights and I would not choose it again. The apartment really is in the basement, it is pretty dark, you never know what the weather is like until you leave the house, the concrete floors make the apartment uncomfortable (bring slippers), there is no closet to hang-up your clothes and I found the place smaller than it appears on the pictures. We did not enjoy staying there. Silvia is very nice and helpful.[QWERTY123]The accommodation was exactly as described. Really conveniently located to several different subways line stations which makes getting around really easy. Bushwick is a really interesting and safe place that Sylvia is lucky enough to call home and that my partner and I were lucky to call home for just over 2 weeks. There were hangers for coats etc and a large chest of drawers for other clothes. The place was really well heated. Sylvia & Ty were extremely helpful and gave us an insight into the local happenings. We would definitely stay here again.[QWERTY123]We enjoyed our stay very much. Silvia was very responsive and helpful, the bed was comfy. Thanks![QWERTY123]We had a great time in Silvia's cute basement apartment.  The space is small but cozy, and the neighborhood is colorful and convenient to other parts of Brooklyn and Manhattan.  Silvia provided us with a map of restaurants, shops and art galleries in the neighborhood, and she even gave us directions over the phone when we got lost trying to find the Brooklyn Flea.  We enjoyed our stay and would definitely stay with Silvia again.[QWERTY123]We stayed at Silvia's place for a weekend, she was very kind and responsive. The basement is cute and has a character. We didn't spend much time exploring the area, but there are plenty of choices for food and drinks and Silvia has prepared a list of them.  
Thank you Silvia.[QWERTY123]I had a Wonderful stay!!!
Very sweet people who I like alot!!!
This was a great way to have meet 2 wonderful new friends!!
Thanks again!!!
Crews[QWERTY123]Staying with Silvia was very nice.  I felt quite comfortable and safe.  The apartment was very clean and nicely furnished.  We didn't have a chance to spend time with Silvia and her husband, but they were very welcoming and Silvia gave us lots of tips for things to do in the area.  I would stay there again for sure.[QWERTY123]My girlfriend and I had a very pleasant stay at Silvia's.  All of my expectations were met or exceeded.

She was friendly and helpful - available if we needed anything but also gave us privacy.  

The place was cozy and clean.  There was no air conditioning downstairs, but there are windows near the ceiling that can be opened for fresh air. 

I would definitely consider staying with Silvia again.  Thank you![QWERTY123]Silvia was very nice, as was her apartment. I will say that Bushwick has an edgy-ness that was a bit surprising at first but when you look a little closer there is a lot to love. I had an amazing time in the area and Sivila's apt was very central.

Thank you Silvia!

Keith[QWERTY123]Just one word to describe my bnb experience with Silvia: Easy! From the beginning, she was available and friendly. The place is fairly close to Manhattan (15min metro distance) and safer than it looks at the first sight. I have slept like a baby. I would have liked to stay longer. Thanks Silvia!
[QWERTY123]I truly ejoyed my stay. Silvia gave me my privacy and the apt was well kept. If I had to come back I would not mind staying there. I recommend her.[QWERTY123]We had a great stay at Silvia's! She's a gracious host, and the place was clean and cozy, thanks![QWERTY123]Hi, I stayed at Silvia's place in Brooklyn, it was great. I had never done a airbnb stay before and the place met all our needs. The water pipes were a tad loud at night, but I am a light sleeper. She also has a very cute daughter. Thanks Silvia! I will be sure to stay again next time.[QWERTY123]Cosy, comfortable and convenient. The place is small, but private and quiet (well, very little street noise but bring earplugs if you're a light sleeper because of the pipes). Close to both the L and the M so very easy to get in or out of midtown or downtown Manhattan, or hipster Williamsburg, etc. A very good find, and we're thankful to Silvia for hosting us![QWERTY123]This basement apartment is exactly as it appears in the pictures. The place was clean and private with fully functioning facilities. Silvia was a great host to me and my boyfriend and was available before and during our stay to answer any questions or concerns. She was really helpful getting us acquainted with the area and provided a map of all the nearby restaurants and attractions. I highly recommend this place for a single person or a couple who seeks an affordable, private place in a cool, diverse, Brooklyn neighborhood.[QWERTY123]Silvia was a gracious host, very easy to work with.  The apartment was clean and private. The hot shower was a blessing after long days of trekking around Manhattan and Brooklyn.  The only problem we had was with the neighborhood.  We heard a terrible street fight late on Saturday night, and we didn't feel very comfortable exploring the area during the day.  Other than that, I would recommend Silvia's place if you are looking to stay around the Brooklyn area.[QWERTY123]Great place in a very convenient location. Would definitely recommend to anyone. Particularly pleasant on really hot days because it stays very cool. Hope to stay again next time I am in Brooklyn.[QWERTY123]The Apt was really pretty and nicely decorated. It is well located on the L train. You can travel easily to BK or to Manhattan. The neighborhood was safe.
The only thing is the noise at night, from the street . Lively neighborhood!

The host was very helpful and nice. 
I recommend this apt if you want a cool place to stay in.[QWERTY123]This was our first Airbnb experience for my wife and I.  We enjoyed our four night stay at Silvia's apartment in Bushwick, Brooklyn.  Silvia was truly a great host!  She responded very fast on all of our text messages, and she gave us plenty amount of tea and coffee when we asked.  The room was very cute and clean, good size for two people.

Perhaps the only problem we had was the neighborhood. It was a bit sketchy and we didn't feel too comfortable when we got off the subway station.  But we didn't encounter any troubles so I think it's safer than it appears!

Silvia gave us the list of local cafe and restaurants, so I strongly recommend to try one of them if you have some free times.  We tried her favorite Italian pizza place, and they had one of the best pizza we've ever had!!!  Thank you Silvia for hosting us wonderful time![QWERTY123]Great host, very centric location, nicely decorated apartment.[QWERTY123]We really enjoyed our stay in this apartment. Silvia is a really nice host, she prepared the map of the area with things to see and do around which was very helpful. We have visited some of her recommended places and really enjoyed. The flat is cosy and comfortable. I would definitely go back again.[QWERTY123]Two months later and I'm still thinking about what an amazing time we had in Brooklyn.  Silvia’s apartment is located in an upcoming neighbourhood near 2 subway stops which go directly into the city.  Add to this the fact that there is one of the best restaurants in the city nearby (Roberta’s (Website hidden by Airbnb) and you have yourself a winner.  You can’t beat the price and you can’t beat the hospitality.  We drove to NYC from Nova Scotia, and we were worried about street parking while we were there but once we arrived it was no problem finding a spot (right across the street from the apt.) and the neighbourhood was very safe.  Just be aware most spots have a 2 hour window twice a week when you have to move for street parking and you’ll be fine.  I’ve seen other comments about the noise in the neighbourhood but either we were too tired to notice or we’re more tolerant because it was never an issue for us.  If you’re looking to do NYC on a budget, Brooklyn is definitely the way to go. We would definitely stay here again.[QWERTY123]This is a modest but comfortable basement apartment, slightly cramped  (I'm 6'2"" and hit my head on a duct a few times, but I'm also a little clumsy!) but clean and quiet. Silvia and her family are great hosts and care about their guests. Good about communication and helping with little things as needed. She also took time to point out things in the area and help with directions. A very positive air bnb experience.[QWERTY123]Silvia was a very friendly and helpful host. The apartment was nice and clean. I would defiantly recommend Silvia to anyone I know.[QWERTY123]Nice Stay and good people who do care about your accommodations![QWERTY123]Sylvia's place was everything we expected: very clean, close to the MTA, with a lot of grocery stores and restaurants around. She had a very useful and detailed list of things to do and places to go to. We didn't get to meet Sylvia in person but she answered our emails right away with any questions we had. Would gladly recommend her place![QWERTY123]We had the best time staying at Silvia's place. Bushwick was a great location and we felt very safe walking around, even late at night. Two subway lines are within easy walking distance and we really found it no hassle at all getting to and from Manhattan. 

The room and bathroom were clean and comfortable, we almost slept too well in the dark and quiet basement room, finding ourselves sleeping late most days. We had everything we needed.

Silvia is lovely and left us with a very useful map full of nearby food and shopping destinations as well as local places of interest. It was my birthday while we were staying and I emailed her in advance to ask if she knew of any good vegetarian restaurants for us to visit for my birthday dinner and she came up with some great options for us. She gave us privacy but was also very available and approachable should we need anything. 

I'll definitely stay again when I eventually make it back and would recommend Silvia's place to anyone.



Thank you so much for a wonderful stay![QWERTY123]Sylvia's place is a very atypical home, close to the MTA, with a lot of grocery stores and restaurants around. 
The basement apartment is clean and confortable.

An atipical positive airbnb experience.

We recommend this Cute apt in artist's home.
[QWERTY123]The basement apartment was pretty much as expected. Was clean and everything was as described. Good bed and my wife and I slept well. Better than most motel beds. Some noise from upstairs but not bad. A little warm when we returned in the evenings but cooled off with the fan on. (we stayed gone most of the day) It was in the 90's some days so with no air conditioner it was surprisingly cool. Very nice couple and we enjoyed our visit to Ty's shop down the street. The neighborhood is in transition but was interesting to visit. Very multicultural. Would consider staying again.
[QWERTY123]My boyfriend and I stayed at Silvia's home last week.  The location was just perfect!  Commuting to Williamsburg and Manhattan (our favorite places to be) was very easy.  The train stations are located near by.  For the most part the apartment was clean, bedding, bathroom and mini kitchenette were user friendly.  A couple of issues, I felt that the photos were misleading with regard to the overall cleanliness....the floor wasn't  the cleanest, we had to wear slippers because our feet would get black.  Then in order to get to the basement apartment you had to go through the garage (which I didn't mind too much) however, it was very crowded with miscellaneous items so you had to be careful coming and going.  I felt the need to purchase my own Lysol and Febreeze to keep some spots clean.  

Otherwise if you are looking for a close location to zip back and forth....this place works well for that purpose.  I met Silvia at the end of the trip, she arranged for her friend to meet us which was just fine:)[QWERTY123]She let us stay 10 days before arrival. She is very flexible. 

I asked her how to get her apartment. But she didn't reply my e-mail so my friend and I lost our way. I had to use my international phone call four times to get her place. It cost $30. It rained terribly that day and I had a big suit case. I didn't feel her consideration.
The room was good and the bathroom was clean. There is not a carpet in the room though.
Somebody was using a washing machine at 6 a.m in the basement. That made me sleep badly.
There isn't a key for the room. It means the room is not completely private. Everyone in the apartment can come into the room.
You can find better one.

[QWERTY123]A nice little basement apartment in Bushwick, a perfect base for a few days in the city. Because it's in the basement it doesn't get much light, but if you're in NY you'll be out all day doing things anyway. Silvia and Ty were super nice, helping me out when I messed up my booking and letting me store my luggage in their garage. 5 stars![QWERTY123]Clean simple place to stay.  A little bit further out than I had anticipated from the city, but not at all far from the subway station.  Took at least 1 hr to get into the city and longer to get back later at night because that train wasn't running straight through
The host was nice and helpful, with plenty of information about the area.
[QWERTY123]Silvia is a kind and easy going host - she was contactable and available throughout our stay, but she gave us our privacy and we rarely saw her.

The apartment was nice - small but clean and had everything we needed.  There was a hairdryer which was useful! Silvia also has a folder which has information on the area and a map with good local bars/restaurants for people who may not know the area. There are lots of great cafes etc close by, and the food almost everywhere is excellent!
The only downside to the apt is its entrance through the garage, but you do get used to it.

If there are people staying in her other apartment above it may be noisy! We had people staying above us near the end of our stay, and I don't think they realised the noise they made really travelled. This wasn't a huge problem for us, but for those who need peace and quiet 24/7 it may not be ideal.

The apt is close to 2 L train stops as well as the M train, and it was very easy to get about.  Some blocks around the Bushwick area felt a little unsafe at night when we walked through them, but we had no trouble at all.

[QWERTY123]Silvia is a wonderful host.  We stayed with her during super-storm Sandy, which was pretty intense.  Silvia was very accommodating and easy to communicate with.  The basement is cozy and user-friendly. Silvia's husband and two kids are really wonderful as well.  Her husband's elegant sculptures are positioned thoughtfully through the space, combining disparate found materials with recycled consumer products.  We highly recommend this apartment.[QWERTY123]I had a great time staying in Sylvia's apartment. It was very convenient getting around Brooklyn with the L and M trains a short walk away. There are some great food options nearby, had a great meal at Roberta's pizza as well as a local taco restaurant. As I was attending conference in Brooklyn, this was a great place to relax after a long day of work. The apartment was generally quiet, but there was a bit of noise from the apartment upstairs which didn't bother me all that much. If I attend the conference next year I will definitely be checking to see if Sylvia's place is available.[QWERTY123]My boyfriend and I stayed here for 7 nights to visit NYC on vacation. We definitely enjoyed staying at Silvia's basement apartment in Brooklyn and would do it again! It was a good deal and Silvia was very nice and accommodating. Using the subway, it took us about 50 minutes to get to Times Square, 35 minutes to get to the financial district, 1 hour 40 minutes to get to LaGuardia airport (if you take a taxi, it costs about $34). The subway station is a few blocks from the apartment, about a 10 min walk. The neighborhood seems a bit sketchy and unsafe at first, but after staying there a while (often coming back late), I've found it to be pretty safe and every night, a police car would drive around. The place is exactly as you see in pictures, water was always hot, and the heater was effective, WiFi was fast, but the only thing that was a bit of a surprise to me was that the bedroom is the only room that you can lock off as your own. The bathroom and kitchen sink area are technically left open, as you don't get a key for these places, but I assume no one is really supposed to come down while we are staying there. Also, you can definitely hear the people upstairs walking and the pipes make some noise, but it didn't bother us too much as neither of us are light sleepers and we were always dead tired when we came back from the city. All in all, had a great experience and strongly recommend staying at Silvia's, especially if you want to save money on hotels![QWERTY123]We stayed in Silvia's apartment for 6 days. Great base to see New York from. Very nice apartment, convenient, cozy and friendly hosts.[QWERTY123]Checked in on Thursday, and Silvia stayed out of our hair the whole time we were there (excellent).  The apartment is not luxurious but it's nice enough, because we weren't in NYC to sit around all day. There was some noise that woke us up in the very early morning, but other than that our stay was very enjoyable.[QWERTY123]cozy space that served as a great little base for my brief time in NYC[QWERTY123]Silvia was accommodating and the unit was clean and convenient. We stayed for a looong time - 11 nights! The private entrance is accessed first into the foyer then through the garage, then down the stairs past the washer and we had no problems with coming in late nights. Partway through our stay some other people came to staying in the other unit she has upstairs and you could definitely hear them but nothing too bad. Shower is small, but again, everything was clean and functional (hot water, wifi, heater, etc.). Great to have the mini-fridge and there was also a toaster oven, electric kettle, coffee maker, etc. and we were able to do a quick load of laundry partway through the stay which was nice (I never heard anyone else doing laundry, but the machine is loud). There is a lock on the bedroom door but not to the main kitchen/bathroom area, though, again, we never saw anyone in the garage or laundry area and I don't expect anyone came into our area. Bed was fairly comfy - firm - and there are now nightstands on both sides of the bed. Lots of great stuff in the area and Silvia provides a binder and map of her favorite bars, restaurants and cultural activities in the area. Several different subway stations within easy walking distance. Would definitely stay again - if you're looking to stay in Brooklyn this is a great, affordable and convenient option.[QWERTY123]All in all a very good experience staying at Silvia's. Silvia and her husband were really friendly and helpful. They live in a nice area away from the touristy city center, close to restaurants and bars. Their  recommendations really helped us to explore the area. Everything worked fine as to communication, check-in etc. There was always someone around if we wanted to ask something, but they never disturbed us. As to the room, it was everything we expected, as shown in the pictures. I would recommend staying here![QWERTY123]Silvia and Ty are very friendly, and their cute little basement apartment was a wonderful oasis at the end of long days (and nights) of exploring. We really loved the neighborhood, an excellent mix of fancy and funky, and the tips provided by the hosts really helped to make sense of them all. There is so much good food around that the efficiency-style kitchen was perfect--who cooks when they're visiting NYC anyway? Clean, comfortable, and private. We were there for a week and only saw others in the building one time. A perfect haven. We'll definitely be looking at their place next time we head to Brooklyn![QWERTY123]Just what we expected!
Nice little appartment in the basement, private bathroom and kitchenette. Bed was comfy.
Silvia stayed pretty much out of our hair, but was available for questions. We were able to use the washing machine and dryer. Three subway stations in walking distance and a lot of shops and restaurants in the area.
All in all enjoyable stay![QWERTY123]We are a young couple and we stayed in late May for three days. A great little apartment in the heart of Bushwick. Easy to get around and the host was fantastic! Check out Roberta's- a great little pizza place in the neighbourhood.[QWERTY123]Had a great stay in Bushwick! 

Silvia and her husband were very accommodating. I was on my own, but the apartment is the perfect size for two people. The bedroom was a very comfortable size and the bathroom was spotless.

It was a bit further out than I thought from Manhattan, but I spent a lot of time in Brooklyn on this trip so it was very convenient. 

Thanks again Silvia![QWERTY123]Clean and cozy! Silvia is a great host; she is available for questions and guidance while respecting your privacy. The apartment has the necessities for a pleasant stay in Brooklyn. It's in a good location with lots to do.[QWERTY123]Me and my friend stayed at Silvia's place for a week. We were out most of the day and there was no problem getting in late. The area is really nice. Silvia gave us a map marked with interesting things to do and see as well as places to go eat. We found some great cafes!
The metro is close and the lovely Williamsburg is only a few stops away.
[QWERTY123]Our stay in Silvia's basement was great. The bed was comfy and everything was very clean. Communication was easy and fast. We loved the area as it felt safe, was well connected to public transport and there was loads going on. Also, the hair dryer for guests was a nice touch as my English one didn't work in the US![QWERTY123]We really enjoyed our stay in Silvia's apartment. It was clean and relatively quiet and had everything we needed for a comfortable stay - bathroom, aircon, small fridge and coffee maker, small toaster oven.

 It's a short walk to the subway L and M lines, we always felt safe walking around the neighbourhood, we had no trouble at all. Silvia provides a map for her guests with local eateries and galleries etc that she recommends and we were never disappointed with her choices! Bushwick looks like there isn't much going on, but you just need to know where to look! 

Silvia was really prompt and helpful in her emails. She was out of town with her family when we visited and she arranged for a friend to let us in and show us around and everything went smoothly. 

Regretfully in our hurry to get to the airport for an international flight, my husband and I forgot to return the apartment keys! This never happens to us! We felt dreadful about it :(

Thanks for the great stay! Next time we visit we'd love to stay again.[QWERTY123]Well I guess this is very New York: Really small apartment and a relatively high price - seen in realtion of course. Pretty loud since there are people living directly over the bedroom, the street and the washing mashine/dryer right there, where the stairs go down - yes, it's in the cellar. No fair-trade tee or coffee as told in the announcement and the kitchen does not need to be mentioned.

Everything else worked out well, got the key and a little map with tips what to do was really nice. Unfortunately did not get the chance to meet Silvia, but I guess she is a nice person.[QWERTY123]The place was very well located and very clean. Perfect for a couple looking to spend a week in NYC.   Silvia and her husband were very kind and helpful towards everything. Next time I visit NYC I would have no doubts on contacting them again.  I recommend it 100%.[QWERTY123]The apartment was nice, comfortable and clean, just a short walk from the L train subway station. Silvia was helpful, easy to communicate and always responded quickly. Overall we had a very pleasant stay. Thank you again, Silvia![QWERTY123]My wife and I had a wonderful stay at Silvia's place. It is located just minutes from the Jefferson Street station on the ""L""line. It was perfect for all our needs.They have a great WiFi connection and the shower water pressure was strong and hot. You must go to Roberta's for the gourmet pizza, which is to die for. It's very popular, so expect a long wait. We went on a Sunday for brunch with no wait. New coffee houses and old bakery's are within a few minutes walk. Enjoy Bushwick!!!![QWERTY123]Appartamento come da foto, piccolo e poco (Website hidden by Airbnb) sacrificio per una piccola vacanza si può anche fare...poco pulito però, abbiamo fatto noi le pulizie e siamo rimasti delusi dall'apparente entrata per raggiungere il basement, passare per un garage fatto deposito non è  il massimo per gli amanti della pulizia. Tutto questo non è menzionato nelle specifiche.
Il bagno è nuovo e discreto rispetto al resto dell'abitazione.
Padroni di casa disponibili ma un pò rumorosi, casa ben posizionata per raggiungere la metro.[QWERTY123]I had a wonderful stay at Silvia's! She was incredibly accommodating and also provided an awesome guide (and map) to the area. The room was clean and private, and also conveniently located. I will definitely consider this as a prime option if I am ever back in the area! (Thanks Silvia!!)[QWERTY123]Nous avons ete tres bien accueillis ! De tres bonnes adresses ! L'endroit etait treq sympa, quartier tres agreable, lit au top et nous en avions besoin apres les longues marches de la journee ![QWERTY123]Close and convenient to pretty much anywhere we needed to go. 15 minutes to Manhattan, 5-10 minutes to Brooklyn. It was perfect for us and close proximity to family.  Did not spend much time at the actual room, but was comfortable and appropriate. Hosts were great and provided all necessary information. Allowed us to check in early and were super accommodating.[QWERTY123]Silvia and Ty's garden apartment unit was the perfect quiet respite for a busy week in New York. It is a short stroll to several subway stops and bus routes that got us around. The space was very private with our own keys, stocked with amenities in the bathroom, coffee and kitchenware, and a concierge folder for restaurant and other neighborhood recommendations for the Bushwick area that proved very helpful. Hangers, umbrellas, and lots of thoughtful small details that made us feel provided for and.

Original artwork and custom metal fixtures by the artists who own the place made the unit very welcoming and unique. My partner and I spent several happy days there and would gladly recommend it to others.[QWERTY123]Very nice stay at Silvia and Ty's place. It was private and I really liked the neighborhood.[QWERTY123]Had a great stay with everything we needed at our finger tips. Silvia and Ty were great hosts. It was very private and just what we needed for the few hours we spent in the apartment. Great price in nice/safe location.[QWERTY123]Silvia and her family were very welcoming.  We felt very safe, and slept great ! The basement was clean, the shower hot, the kitchen area stocked with basics. 
We did not hear any noise above us, so it was a quiet retreat at the end of the days roaming around the city.  Bushwick also is a very cool neighborhood,  and  easy to walk around, and get to subway. 
I was prepared for the going thru the garage because of other reviews....but it's not  for anyone elderly.  Furnishings are modest, concrete floor, simple bedding. I would return to this spot again.[QWERTY123]amazing stay, and great neighborhood! i would pay more[QWERTY123]Silvia had a notebook full of neighborhood suggestions and info to browse through when we arrived. The apartment was clean and looked just how we imagined it. It really felt like our own little apartment for a week. Our hosts were very accommodating and friendly.[QWERTY123]My wife and I stayed for a week while we toured the city.  We had complete privacy in the nice and cool basement space.  The neighborhood offers a good variety of places restaurants and cafes to choose from.  The L train is not too far of a walk, so access to Manhattan is not too difficult.  Silvia's place also had wifi and a great shower.  The only thing I wish we had were a couple more pillows, other than that our stay at Silvia's was very nice.[QWERTY123]Silvia and Ty were very accommodating and hospitable. The apartment was pretty easy to find and close to several trains, including the L, which we took frequently. The list of suggestions our hosts had was great and really appreciated. The apartment was perfect for what we needed-- a cozy, safe place to crash after a busy day of exploring. I hope to stay again in the future![QWERTY123]Silvia was great at keeping in touch and made it easy for our late evening check in. We really like the neighbourhood, and Silvia obviously does too, as she gave great local recommendations. It is so well-priced, so don't expect the bells and whistles, and you'll have a nice time.[QWERTY123]Quick, easy, nice, fun location, really cool art all over the place.[QWERTY123]The pros :
+ confortable room and nice bathroom 
+ location near the L train
+ kind and understanding host 

The cons :
- needs a bit refurbishment
- messy garage, but that's art ;-) 
[QWERTY123]We so enjoyed our stay at Silvia and Ty's place! The apartment was very clean, private, spacious, and adorable. Silvia was a great host, very responsive and even provided us with a binder full of information about the area, and the location was perfect- quiet but very close to trains and everything to do in Bushwick/Brooklyn. We would love to stay at the Tripoli house again the next time we visit the city![QWERTY123]Me and my sister had wonderful time in Silvia's apartment. She is very warm and kind for us. The basement is enough size for two, very clean, cute and warm!. Easy walk to a few stations(L & M lines) and shops. Washing machine and dryer was very helpful too. Thanks Silvia :)[QWERTY123]Conveniently located near the L line. Feels private with own way to get in. Comfy bed.[QWERTY123]We enjoyed a lot our week at Silvia bassement. The apartment was clean and smart. There is a stair not suitable for elder people. The area is quiet and very close to subway station direct to union square.  This is good conection too with JFK airport. Wifi is good and we have no problems there. Thanks a lot for all Silvia!!!![QWERTY123]Nice cozy basement. Great area with good resturants, food store and close to subway stations. Silvia was very nice and there was no problems staying there at all. I would totally recommend this place.[QWERTY123]Silvia's basement apartment was cute, quiet, private, cozy and clean!!! We felt right at home with all of the extras she provided. Let us drop off our bags early, and leave them hours after we checked out. So convenient and overall a great experience. I would definitely recommend staying here![QWERTY123]I personally met with the owner, she was very sweet and  warm. I felt really comfortable staying in her own. Everything was accurate in the description. It is a basement apartment, so there are ""basement"" sounds. But other than that, it was a great place to stay in Brooklyn.[QWERTY123]Silvia made it easy for us to check into the apartment. This apartment was just two blocks from our daughters and it was quite a comfortable walk, as comfortable as can be in 10 degrees in January winter[QWERTY123]Great little space for my weekend trip. Silvia and Ty were very responsive when I needed something and there was limited noise. No street noise, but you can definitely here vacuuming, walking, if anything drops. It is a basement after all! But definitely would stay here again[QWERTY123]Siamo stati accolti dal marito di Silvia, Ty, che ci ha lasciato le chiavi e mostrato la stanza. La zona è tranquilla e la metro vicina. Il letto è comodo, ma la stanza era davvero troppo umida. Probabilmente è meglio d'estate.[QWERTY123]We had a great stay at Silvia's apartment! It is close too many great restaurants and bars. It's also close to the train that goes in too Manhattan. Silvia was helpful if we had any questions about the area as well.[QWERTY123]It was easy to communicate with the hosts to arrange my check-in time.  The description of the apartment is accurate.  It is very basic, but comfortable.  The lighting was good, the bed was comfortable, there was plenty of hot water and towels, and the wifi worked well.  Kitchenette is very basic, not set up for serious cooking, but it was nice to have a fridge.  The weather was quite hot during my stay, but the fan in the bedroom cooled things off at night so that I had no trouble sleeping.  It was also very quiet.[QWERTY123]The apartment was clean and the host was kind and attentive. The only downside was that the bed was a bit hard and the room a bit hot. The price was worth it, though![QWERTY123]Silvia was great, and allowed me to check in early because my flight arrived at 6:00 AM.  The place is exactly how described.  Nice, clean, new bathroom, small kitchenette, just enough for a weekend trip.  The bedding and towels were clean.  There were hangers and a place to hang  clothes.  
The apartment is small, and can only accommodate two people.  It is in the basement, and was a bit warm in mid-September, but there is a good fan that kept us cool at night.  Great location, quiet neighborhood, only a few blocks from the Central subway station.   Lots of places to eat, and unwind. There a good grocery store very close by.   There is a bus stop just outside the house.  Silvia also has a very extensive map of the neighborhood, with restaurants, bars and coffee shops, and other points of interest identified.  Nice place, close to my son's apartment, and made our trip less complicated.[QWERTY123]We had a great time at Silvia's cute apartment. The room is in the basement and was very quiet at night. We had a private shower (as well as towels) and a small kitchen. There was has a lot of restaurants nearby and the apartment is also close to the orange and silver lines to Manhattan.[QWERTY123]Modest living. Great for backpackers/travelers.[QWERTY123]This was a great place in a great location. Nice and secluded so you have your own space and they let us drop off our suitcases early so we could do some sightseeing.[QWERTY123]A really nice area and a perfect space to rest up between busy New York trips. Really great for young couples or travellers wanting to experience Brooklyn rather than the more touristy Manhatten. Really recommended[QWERTY123]Silvia est accueillante , l'appartement est très sympat dans un quartier agréable.[QWERTY123]Incredible value! We've never stayed in Bushwick before, usually preferring Brooklyn Heights. That area has become too pricey, so we took a chance on Bushwick, hearing it's become fun and eclectic and safer. It was all of that, plus friendly and felt safe.

Absolutely enjoyable area, more than enough coffee shops and restaurants to walk to, and we also walked a lot to nearby Williamsburg, with even more opportunities for great dining. 

Silvia and her family were wonderful; we enjoyed meeting her smart and charming daughter and her interesting artist husband, who maintains an art studio next-door that you can visit.

This basement apartment is reached through a narrow passageway in a full storage garage, which might be off-putting at first, but don't be fooled: you come down the stairs and into a clean, spacious and minimal apartment.  It is basic, but has everything you need. Extra toiletries, toaster oven, coffee maker, extra comforter, etc. 
There's a groovy custom-made bench and iron table to sit at for a quick snack or some sightseeing planning.

Silvia provides a three-ring binder with neighborhood menus and house rules. Try El Kucho, just on the next block, *great* Mexican & nice owners. At this time, they have not yet received their liquor license, but about five doors down on the same spot is a great wine store.  
Archie's, a nearby bar and pizza spot is a great alternative to the 1-2 hour wait at famous Roberta's pizza.

One or two reviewers here have said that it was warm down there in the summer. The weather was cool during our visit, so we weren't too warm. The temperature was really perfect. There are two small windows in case you feel claustrophobic, but we never did. She has decorated it in a way that feels airy. At any rate, we were out of our room early and back late, enjoying Brooklyn!

The bed and pillows are quite firm, but we slept well. You are in a basement; expect upstairs noise. I am a very light sleeper, so I always bring earplugs; noise wasn't a problem.

I don't see how anyone could get a better value in Brooklyn, so close to Brooklyn Heights. I doubt we will ever stay anywhere else again. I see myself coming back here year after year!
[QWERTY123]Perfect inexpensive place to sleep and keep your things while spending time in Brooklyn/New York City. The apartment is in the basement of a house, but has all the basics - real bed, bathroom, mini-fridge. Youll be spending all your time exploring the city anyway, so this little spot is the best deal if you just want a private space to lay your head at the end of the day. The neighborhood is great as well - it's a 10 minute walk to the nearest L stop, and close to lots of great Bushwick restaurants and bars as well.[QWERTY123]Host was communinative and helpful to our arrival. Directions were provided from port authority.[QWERTY123]I enjoyed my stay. It was a nice private space with everything I needed. Thanks![QWERTY123]Silvia's home was just what I needed. The apartment was right near the gallery I was presenting at. Which was also very convenient. Excellent communication from the get go. Thank you.[QWERTY123]The place was easy to find at a 15-minute walk from Jefferson St metro. We were stuck in traffic on the way to NYC, but  texted the hosts on our way and had no problem arriving later than we had told them originally.

As listed, the place is a basement, but it is not an entirely separate apartment, with the entrance being through a garage used as storage space and quite crowded.
Also, being in the basement there is no central heating, but a small space heater. Furthermore, being next to the furnaces and pipes there is quite a bit of noise during the night, and steps from the kids in the morning.

The mini-kitchen is less than what would be expected from an ""entire apartment""; to be fair it is as listed, but it is not possible to cook or even heat a frozen pizza, since there is no stove or oven, so it's not possible to have more than a simple breakfast.[QWERTY123]Silvia was very accommodating especially with the checking in/out process. This little apartment is perfect if you want somewhere to stay at night while you spend your days out & about in the city. It's in the heart of Bushwick where you are not too far from the rest of Brooklyn, and not too far away from Manhattan, either. It had the essentials, including heat and a fan. The bathroom is cute, as well. This space is perfect for two people. Keep in mind, you're in a basement, so you hear everything going on above you, but that comes with any basement apartment. It was a lovely stay & I will definitely keep Silvia & her husband's space in mind if I ever find myself in the Brooklyn area.[QWERTY123]Very good, quiet place to stay. Had all needed amenities (no microwave though) and some great restaurants nearby. Pretty close to the subway too, ~20-30 minutes to downtown Manhattan. Sylvia was very welcoming and accommodating. Would definitely stay there again.[QWERTY123]Silvia and her partner Ty were really nice, reactive and available. The accomodation corresponds to the description, it's pretty minimalist and is located in the basement and accessible via a pretty packed garage and laundry room. It has a separate bedroom, a private bathroom and a small kitchenette with mini fridge and coffee maker (keep in mind that there is no stove for cooking so you can't cook dinner or even have dinner in the basement - no windows and no proper table to enjoy a meal). The bedroom is just under their apartment so you hear the lovely kids jumping around in the morning :) The area is nice, very fancy restaurants and bars, I would recomment 983 Café, Forest Park, Sea Wolf, Momo Sushi Shack, Roberta's etc. Silvia and Ty will give you a very useful recap of the bars/cafes/restaurants nearby the basement, vith (Hidden by Airbnb) maps so you can see where they are located. Very very useful thank you! You are near the L line (Jefferson Street) and the M line (Central Av) so you have several options to reach Manhattant. Amazing street art in the area, great vibes in the Latin American barber shops where they dance while working, groceries stores available, definitely a good area. Enjoy!!!![QWERTY123]Non abbiamo conosciuto Silvia ma siamo stati accolti e sempre in contatto con Tyrome, persona accogliente gentile e disponibile.
Appartamentino nel seminterrato della casa ci si accede passando attraverso un garage abbastanza disordinato, ma passato quello la casa si presenta pulita, ordinata, piccola ma accogliente arredata con numerose opere d'arte costruite con materiali di riciclo e metalli dallo stesso Tyrome che è un artista.
Nota positiva la vicinanza alla Metro.
Unica nota negativa i vicini piuttosto rumorosi..
Il quartiere non ha l aspetto dei migliori  quartieri di Brooklyn ma tutto sommato è tranquillo, tappezzato di locali e negozietti vari.[QWERTY123]Ty was there to welcome us when we arrived.  The place was exactly as he described. There are local stations to take the train.[QWERTY123]Tyrone's place was the perfect location and just what we needed.[QWERTY123]We had a great time at Tu's studio. The studio was clean, confortable and exactly as shown in the photos. Ty was very kind and welcoming. Location is perfect if you wish to see the NYC and have fun in Brooklyn, Williamsburg and Bushwick. Totally recommend! Thanks again for everything![QWERTY123]Thank you for a good experience. We were so close to our daughter and the subway. We would definitely stay here again.[QWERTY123]Our stay at Tyrome's was great! As anyone who's been to NYC might know, despite being awesome, the city can also be chaotic and tiresome at times, and Tyrome's basement was a perfect peaceful and private place to rest after a long day. Bushwick is a nice and interesting neighborhood with lots of places to go and see in itself, and Tyrome had a lot of great recommendations on nearby cafes, restaurants etc. We didn't actually see Tyrome much during our stay but he was always available and nice if we had any questions or problems.[QWERTY123]We had an amazing time in Tyrome's place. We didn't have much direct contact with Tyrome, but when we did, he was super friendly and helpful. The apartment itself is fairly basic, but I think this is reflected in the price. There is so much to do in Bushwick (amazing restaurants, bars and events) that we just used the place for sleeping. Would definitely recommend!![QWERTY123]Tyrome was very welcoming and we had overall a nice stay.
The accomodation matches the pictures and it is located in the basement and accessible via a pretty packed garage and laundry room. It's a quiet place to stay and close to the J and M subway line to go to Manhattan (about 20 min).[QWERTY123]Todo es igual que en las fotos, el espacio era justo lo que necesitabamos para nuestra estadia. Tyrome y Silvia son simpaticos, se preocuparon de estar para recibirnos, y se aseguraron que todo estuviera a nuestra conveniencia. Incluso, ellos hicieron un librito que compila los mejores lugares para ir a comer o tomar algo por el barrio, eso junto con el mapa de las ubicaciones. El barrio es muy buena onda, con mucho arte y varios bares. Es seguro como para salir o llegar a cualquier hora.[QWERTY123]Place was great and as described. Tyrome was a nice guy. Thanks![QWERTY123]Ty was a really approachable friendly host, this is definitely a rough and ready listing but has all the basics you need.[QWERTY123]just correct :)[QWERTY123]The apartment was in a fantastic location, close to 3 subway lines. It was (Email hidden by Airbnb) munication with Ty was quick and he let us store our bags in his garage for a couple hours after we checked out. The apartment itself was pretty basic. No soap to wash dishes that we could find. No microwave. It was pretty warm when we were there too, we didn't realize until the last night that there is a fan in the bedroom, stored behind a dresser.[QWERTY123]The place is as described. Located 7-10 minutes by foot from the subway (M and L)[QWERTY123]Comfortable stay, short walk to subway stations.[QWERTY123]Nice place, cozy and private. 8 min walk from metro station. We only saw Tyrome the first day, he is very nice and helpful.[QWERTY123]Tyrome was an excellent host - letting us drop off our bags at the apartment before the check-in time so that we could wander off, and letting us leave them again at the end, as our flight didn't leave until the evening. He was great with communication as well.

The apartment is in a great location - about a 15 min walk to the nearest subway, which takes you through Brooklyn to Manhattan. It was a brilliant base for exploring the city. The neighbourhood itself is also great - lots of independent bars, cafes and quirky shops, as well as some superb restaurants.

The apartment itself is as it looks in the photos - pretty shabby chic. You have the basement floor to yourself (but share the main entrance door with the rest of the house) which includes the bedroom, a small bathroom and a little kitchenette with a sink, kettle and fridge. But why would you need more than that when there are so many world-class restaurants and take-outs in the city?

All in all, Tyrome's was great value - a perfect place to crash after days of exploring NYC. I would recommend staying here![QWERTY123]Todo estaba tal y como se describe en el anuncio. Buena comunicación de transporte. Tyrome nos dejo una carpeta con bastante información de la zona, la cual nos sirvió de bastante ayuda.[QWERTY123]Tyrome is one of the best hosts I've ever had on AirBnB...he not only let us check-in early on the day we arrived, he was also very understanding when our trip ended with an unfortunate illness and he was more than understanding to allow me to stay in the room the few extra hours that made all the difference in helping me rest and catch my trans-atlantic flight. Tyrome thank you so much, you are very kind and generous, and my partner and I really enjoyed our stay in your cosy and unique little flat, a perfect getaway to Brooklyn and Manhattan and a quiet and warm place to come back to after a day and night exploring the city! The list of local bars and restaurants was also great for exploring all the great places around Bushwick.[QWERTY123]My boyfriend and I stayed here for a.few days since we wanted to explore NYC. The apartment is a basement apartment in their home, and aa such, it did get a little noisy above our heads sometimes. 

The good: Great location. There's a bus that comes right in front of house and it's a 10 minute walk to train station. Also, when you get into the apartment, host has a book which gives you suggestions of food toneat in the area. Very helpful. They also have a whole setup of toiletries, irons, hair dryera, toaster oven, etc. For you to use! There's  also a heater which was great because it was very cold.

The not so great: the walls could use cleaning. I only looked at them once and didn't  want to again. Also, the blankets provided have some spots on them so that freaked me out. Finally, when he says small, it's  verrrry small and people over 6'0 might be uncomfortable in the space. 

Overall, a pretty good experience.[QWERTY123]A nice cozy kitchenette in a historic area in BK. I was welcomed by Tyrome and his 2 children at the door. That was the only time we crossed paths during my stay. It is a basement apartment so you will hear the typical noises such as pipes and boiler but nothing loud and crazy. I will be booking again in the future.[QWERTY123]Another great stay. Wouldn't choose another host.[QWERTY123]The pics do more justice to the place when your actually there. The issue for us was that it was listed and confirmed in messages that the place is 'private', however when my partner was alone in the basement, someone was at the top of the stairs doing the laundry, meaning they could easily come downstairs where there is no lock. We decided to check out early and although I paid for the extra 2 nights, my issue was the lack of courtesy communication from the host. I wrote 2 very honest messages (nice one too) about why we wanted to check out and there was no response and although I didn't expect it, it just felt the host wasn't bothered. Just the lack of courtesy is a result of this review, although I can put up with the fact the place wasn't as described.[QWERTY123]Wouldn't stay anywhere else in brooklyn but here. Great host.[QWERTY123]Great place to stay for short trips to the city.     So many things I didn't know I'd need were provided, including a list of all the local restaurants/bars and art galleries. He made it really easy for us to settle in.[QWERTY123]You get what you pay for. There is noise from the heating and the apartment is in the basement, it is a fact. Tyrome was a very friendly host and we indeed had a good stay.[QWERTY123]Nice short stay! Good area good food good people![QWERTY123]Great place! Cute apartment, perfect for place to stay to enjoy Brooklyn and Manhattan. If you are just looking for the basics, a bed and a bathroom, this is it. If we were staying longer and were looking to stay in and cook or anything, this is too small for that. But since we wanted to explore all day, this is all we needed, and the price is right. Tyrome was very kind and had an awesome art gallery that you walk through to get to the apartment. There were two locking doors so we felt safe. The neighborhood is amazing, right next to Alphaville which is a cool bar and venue. The walk to the Jefferson stop is a bit of a hike for those who arent used to walking like a new yorker, but overall it was close enough to everything. I would stay here again for sure![QWERTY123]If you didn't notice it through the pictures, that's a cave! A real cave that you access through a garage. The building pipes make a lot of noise. 
But if you are in town to enjoy what has to offer the big apple, not staying home, it could worth it. Let's say that's one of the less expensive (not cheapest, the place is not that cheap) apartment around. And the apartment looks more as a private bedroom than full apartment.[QWERTY123]Everything was great, thank you![QWERTY123]Very unobtrusive host! You pass through storage area to get to apartment, but it's not too bad. Tyrome left tips about neightborhood in his little purple book, and andswered questions quickly! I read some people complaining about 10m walk to train station. This is NYC. Better be ready to do some walking whenever you get out. Otherwise take a taxi or bus right in front of the apartment.[QWERTY123]The space is large for New York, the hosts are quite private and give you space, which was good.  The linen a pillows were lower end, but everything else was nice and we were happy with our stay.[QWERTY123]Tyrome has been a nice host and helped us out wherever he could! The appartement was very basic, but functional. Definetly a good choice for a low budget, but maybe not suitable for people who expect a cozy and super comfortable place. We weren't a lot at home anyway, so for us it was perfect! :) thanks to Tyrome again![QWERTY123]Great cozy space and Ty was very accommodating.[QWERTY123]Perfecte locatie om Brooklyn te verkennen. De wijk Bushwick is fantastisch en zeer zeker de moeite waard om verder te verkennen. Goede uitval locatie om in Manhattan te komen. Goede metro verbinding, alles is op loopafstand.
Het appartement was precies zoals op de foto's. Heel rustig in de avond/nacht, wij hebben nauwelijks wat gehoord. Onze eerste dagen was het koud, dus het kacheltje was erg fijn!
Ty is een goede host en erg duidelijk in zijn communicatie! Leuk om hem nog een paar keer gezien te hebben en ook dan is hij zeer vriendelijk en behulpzaam[QWERTY123]Gives you the essentials. Owner is very responsive.[QWERTY123]Nice place, clean, great area, near subway line![QWERTY123]Même si nous avons eu un effet de surprise en pénétrant d'abord dans l'appartement (il faut traverser une pièce débarras avant de descendre à la cave, puis on retrouve l'appartement avec plancher en béton non fini !), nous nous sommes rapidement rendus compte des atouts du lieu : propreté impeccable, fraîcheur même s'il faisait 40C dehors, douche agréable, silence et noirceur pour la nuit...
Nous n'avons pas rencontré notre hôte, mais la communication avec lui fût cordiale, simple et facile.
Je déconseillerais si vous aimez vous attarder longuement chez vous avant de sortir faire des activités, puisque l'endroit est sans charme, mais si comme nous vous préférez aller parcourir brooklyn ou manhattan de votre éveil jusqu'au coucher, cet appartement situé prêt de tout, frais(!), propre et très abordable vous rendra aussi heureuses que nous ![QWERTY123]This was a great find in Brooklyn, and we were very happy in the few days we spent there. The neighborhood is great, close to the subway (about a 10m walk). Lots of shops & restaurants nearby. We met up with family during our stay and ended up walking back from the subway at 1 or 2 in the morning a couple times with no problems. It's a big city so you need to pay attention, but overall it's a GREAT neighborhood. We also drove there (on a road trip so couldn't skip having a car) and found street parking our entire stay- which was an awesome bonus.
The area isn't huge but is great for NYC. My husband is pretty tall (over 6') but he just watched his head and was fine. The bathroom is small (but really cute for a small space!) and the shower is great. You are in a basement, and we were there in summer so it was fairly humid inside and out, but the price, location and awesome host outweighed it. We would DEFINITELY stay here again, in a heart beat.[QWERTY123]Tyrome's place was exactly what we were looking for in Brooklyn. It was a quiet and private studio in the basement of his home. We loved how close it was to so many restaurants and cafes. The studio was clean and had everything we needed to be comfortable. We had an issue with the keys one night and Tyrome was super responsive and made sure we got in okay. I would recommend this place to anyone who is trying to explore Bushwick and get away from the noise of the city.[QWERTY123]Este espaço é um lugar perfeito para quem busca um local simples e bom para dormir. Não dispõe de grandes luxos. Estranhamos o local de entrada, pois fica atravessando uma garagem bem bagunçada e suja. Em compensação, o quarto é limpo.
O local fica perto de duas paradas de metro que levam à Mannhatan. Não é tão prático que nem ficar na ilha, mas é uma forma excelente de economizar para gastar em outras coisas.
Tyrome como anfitrião foi excelente, prontamente respondendo as mensagens.
Pontos altos: banho excelente, dispõe de máquina de lavar roupas, secador de cabelos e cafeteira.[QWERTY123]Ty's place is a basement room as described so expect all that comes with that. Can get a bit noisy from upstairs foot traffic. Didn't bother us much but if you're a light sleeper I can see how that may be an issue. It did have a faint odor but again, it's a basement. The location was great if you're looking to check out the Bushwick/Bed-Stuy area. There's lots to do and see all around Ty's place. L train is about 3 blocks away if you're looking to head to the city. This is gonna be one of those spots where you rest your head at night after a full day of exploring not so much of a place to hang out at. Ty is a super chill guy and made everything easy.[QWERTY123]Great host, great little spot.[QWERTY123]The apartment is overall decent, but was definitely not what we expected from the impression we got through pictures and description. The apartment had a changing odor from being the laundry room and the basement, meaning that it smelled part time of detergent and part time of moist. Furthermore we didn't have the opportunity to lock the basement door, which we didn't feel good about, due to all of our personal belongings being down there throughout the day. 

But in general a decent apartment, where you get what you pay for. Really nice and friendly host though. Tyrome was very helpful, both in person and through text messages. The neighborhood is something of itself. It's a very cool place to be located, if you want to experience Brooklyn, and everything it has to offer.[QWERTY123]El apartamento es mucho más bonito en fotos que en la realidad. Accedes por un garaje que está super descolocado. Es un sotano que huele mucho a humedad. No entra casi luz. Las dos únicas ventanas son minúsculas y se oye todo lo de la calle. La cama está humeda. El dueño vive en la casa (en la planta de arriba). Ni se despidió de nosotros. Un poco cutre todo y muy bizarro, eso sí. Muy bien comunicado con el centro con la línea L.[QWERTY123]Lively neighborhood, great host! Thank you![QWERTY123]Everything was just as we expected it to be. Tyrome is a very nice guy, and an interesting artist. Though the apartment is in the basement, it wasn't very humid, and Tyrome made everything to make it comfy. We had a nice stay in the very artsy and nice community in Brooklyn. The L train is nearby and Tyrome has a lot of suggestions for activities and places to eat/go out close to the apartment on a cute selfmade (Hidden by Airbnb) map he put into the apartment. The apartment is quite quiet, but you can hear the people above you, which didn't bother us, but if you're sensitive it might disturb your sleep. All in all it was very nice, and we would come back everytime.[QWERTY123]This basement studio/apartment is great for the solo adventure traveler or a young couple who want to be in the heart of Brooklyn. That being said, it is not a place you want to hang out in more than sleeping and using it as a base. The water pressure is great and the extra area between the bedroom and bathroom was helpful for space and food area.  Tyrome was a wonderful accommodating host and I enjoyed talking with him about his art and life in Brooklyn. He also has a cool apartment for rent above the space with mid century furniture if its available it is a great bargain for the space.[QWERTY123]Fantastic communication with the host, however we were a little disappointed with the level of noise, cleanliness & bed linen during our 3 night stay.[QWERTY123]Tyrome's place is cool. It's a little different and quirky, but has everything you need. It's easily walkable to public transport, take-out and what looked to be pretty good nightlife. If we'd had a longer stay I'm sure we'd have checked it out![QWERTY123]Un séjour parfait, l appartement de Tyrome était conforme à l annonce, super bien placé dans un quartier vivant et pittoresque. Metro et commerces à proximité, je recommande vivement cet appartement.[QWERTY123]Overall, Tyrome's apartment is a great place to stay. It's reasonably priced and it's in a cool part of town. Also, catching the L into Manhattan is super easy as there are a few stations that are walking distance from the apartment. Probably not the best place for an extended stay where you plan on cooking meals at home, but it was great for a few nights.[QWERTY123]Tres bon rapport qualité prix. Adapté si vous comptez partir tôt et rentrer tard après le dîner. L appartement est très bruyant et très humide. L'emplacement permet d accéder rapidement à Manhattan et de profiter des bars et restaurants de brooklyn.[QWERTY123]Very artistic neighborhood, he supplied us with a list of things to do in the area such as dining, entertainment, etc. He was there if we needed him, but out of the way if we didn't. Was very quiet and could hardly hear any traffic from the apartment. I would definitely recommend staying with Tyrome.[QWERTY123]Great area. Lovely space[QWERTY123]Great host! Cool space![QWERTY123]Schönes Apartment mit guter Anbindung an die öffentlichen Verkehrsmittel. Das Apartment ist sauber und bietet alles, was man so benötigt.[QWERTY123]Basement dans un quartier du bushwick en pleine expension. Proche des transports. Apportez juste vos boules Quies ! :)[QWERTY123]Great stay in the basement apartment. Ty made sure everything was clean and ready to go and stayed in touch with me throughout. Loved the area, ten minute walk to the L train. Wouldn't have stayed anywhere else. Definitely will be back next time I'm in the area.[QWERTY123]This is a cool, funky artist's place, and it is located in a busy, lively neighborhood in Bushwick, Brooklyn. You may need to be a bit bohemian to enjoy the vibe and the basement room that you access through an art gallery,  but it was perfect for me. Access to Manhattan is easy via the L train, and there is a ton of restaurants and coffee places and shopping in the immediate neighborhood. Ty is friendly and communicates promptly. The WiFi is screaming fast, too... I clocked 40+ mbps. Bathroom is cramped, but there's plenty of hot water in the shower. I would definitely stay here again.[QWERTY123]Overall, for the price and location, this is a great stay if you aren't going to be spending much time in the AirBnb. We spent most of our time exploring the city and the host was very accommodating with check-in times and had the place ready early for me, which was much appreciated!

Pros:
-Great location close to the metro
-Fun art installation upstairs
-Mini fridge
-Fantastic host; quick response time and helpful with check-in/advice
-Fairly quiet neighborhood, which was nice! :)

Cons:
-Shared laundry at top of the steps was very loud when in use
-Loud vent in the room that woke me up a few times
-No extra blankets... thin/old bedding that didn't keep me very warm
-Kind of dingy/cold feel with concrete floors[QWERTY123]Decent spot.[QWERTY123]Don't necessarily rely on the pictures![QWERTY123]Ty’s place was amazing!! The art is it’s own plus, but the space feels even more cozy with the added touches! Ty was super nice and helpful. Would definitely suggest anyone wanting an authentic Brooklyn experience to stay here![QWERTY123]Tyrome is a great host. There’s a ton of local art in the area, which is super rad. I’d definitely stay here again.[QWERTY123]Cet appartement est parfait pour avoir un endroit très bon marché où rester à Bushwick dans un sous-sol de maison.[QWERTY123]This is a great place to stay if you need something small and funcional for a stay in NYC/Brooklyn/Bushwick. I stayed here for ~5 days with my husband and it served to be a perfect temporary home. It has a private entrance, places to hang clothes, hot water, mini fridge, basic kitchen utensils and amenities, and towels. 

Cons: In the winter.. it’s rather cold in there. No heater. The sink in the bathroom is surprisingly small but there is another larger sink in the kitchenette. The place is small (which we liked) but my husband (6’1”)  kept hitting his head on the vents lol but other than that we loved the space. We didn’t spend much time in the space itself though. 

The area is a safe and interesting place to walk around and explore. It’s near a few subway stations, grocery stores, bars, cafes, and a park. We absolutely loved this location and would use this Airbnb again with no hesitation!

~40 min from LaGuardia by taxi and Uber and about 25-30 USD[QWERTY123]Bei der Kellerwohnung war alles genauso wie beschrieben. Check-In und Check-Out verliefen ohne Probleme.
In der Nähe gibt es viele Bars, Delis und Restaurants, die zu Fuß zu erreichen sind. Außerdem gibt es zwei alternative Wege, um mit der Subway schnell Manhattan zu erreichen.

Wir sind sehr zufrieden! Thanks Tyrome[QWERTY123]Todo fue excelente, muy sencillo y práctico. 
El lugar es tal cual como se muestra en las fotos.[QWERTY123]This spot is perfect in regards to distance from the subway and conveniently next to a park and grocery store. It was perfect for the weekend with my friends in NYC!!![QWERTY123]Good location right next to the L train and JMZ, good for someone in town and on the go.[QWERTY123]A wonderful place to stay while we explored the city. Easy to get to, close to the subway, amazing coffee nearby and a great host! We hope to stay here again soon.[QWERTY123]L'emplacement est idéal dans Brooklyn, proche d'endroits animés et de 2 stations de métro.
Par contre il faut bien savoir qu'il s'agit d'un appartement en sous-sol très spartiate. Il n'y a pas à proprement parler de table pour les repas, très peu de luminosité et l'ensemble des équipements sont anciens.
Si vous chercher un peu de confort, je vous le déconseille par contre si vous cherchez un logement entier à faible prix je vous le conseille.[QWERTY123]Tyrome's place is super cute, in a wonderfully vibrant area and very well located in terms of public transit. Couldn't recommend more highly![QWERTY123]I definitely recommend staying at Tyrome’s lovely apartment. Based in Bushwick it really gives you a feel of being a real New Yorker travelling into Manhattan. The apartment was clean, tidy and private as well as having a great artistic vibe. Tyrome was extremely responsive whenever we needed anything and also left a very handy guide to local amenities! Definitely worth a stay![QWERTY123]The location is great, great communication through the subway, very private.
It is what it said it.
 It was a good experience[QWERTY123]Cool guy, unique spot in Brooklyn![QWERTY123]Matches the description. Communication was easy. 10 min walking from a subway. Decent place to stay for a week.[QWERTY123]It was a very nice stay ![QWERTY123]Tyrome provides lots of info on the neighborhood in a nice binder. it would be a great place for one or two people looking to explore the awesome neighborhood and the city at large. I didn't spend a ton of time there as it was quite warm inside and did smell a little off but I let Tyrome know and I'm sure they will take care of it as I found him to be a communicative host.[QWERTY123]Nous sommes restés 10 jours. L'appartement est très proche d'une station de métro (7 minutes à pied), ce qui est très pratique quand on passe la journée dehors et que l'on souhaite rentrer rapidement le soir. Le quartier est pittoresque avec des petits commerces à proximité. Il est très pratique pour faire ses petites commissions alimentaires. 
Toutefois, il faut garder à l'esprit que l'appartement est en sous-sol et qu'il dispose d'une luminosité faible. A cela s'ajoute un problème d'humidité qui laisse une odeur persistante lorsqu'on rentre le soir. Le manque d'aération est sans doute un facteur explicatif. Il n'est pas possible de cuisiner : l'appartement dispose seulement d'un frigo et d'un évier. 
Malgré ces derniers éléments nous avons passé un très bon séjour. La communication avec Tyrome a été très facile tout au long du séjour.[QWERTY123]Great location.  Easy access to downtown.  Also, easy access to ISP airport which I traveled from. Quiet area lots of food places around. I had my littles with me and there was a park literally 1 min away.[QWERTY123]This Airbnb is truly a BASEMENT : there is no light, a bad smell, mold, dust everywhere (we had to crush two spiders) and more importantly there is no aeration, so towels won't dry after the shower and quickly the smell gets worse. Equipments in the kitchen are very limited, dirty, the plates are dusty. There were tasks on our sheets, the pillows smelled badly, no extra-sheets. We stayed for two nights and we were very dissatisfied with our stay, we recommend you to RUN AWAY from this Airbnb for minimum comfort, even though the price seems appealing. On a more positive note, the Airbnb is not far from the subway, you can easily reach Manhattan.[QWERTY123]Great little place, awesome location to base a trip out of. Subway stations are about a 10 minute walk away. Tyrome is great and very responsive. Place is a little cramped if you are tall, I hit my head a few times at night on the way to the bathroom.[QWERTY123]I would definitely come back to stay with Tyrome for future trips! His place was so quaint and a gem in Bushwick. Lovely area, great communication and also so kind![QWERTY123]Good location enjoyed our stay and would recommend.[QWERTY123]Great location, easy to check in, unique place, and a lovely host if you bump into him![QWERTY123]good location and clean place. just what we were looking for[QWERTY123]The apartment is not far from the M, which makes it super convenient to get around Brooklyn and back into Manhattan. There is a bus stop right outside the apartment, as well. As a result, it can be a little loud at night and you have to keep the windows open for fresh air. Overall, a great place to stay and Tyrome was very accommodating to our early check-in/check-outs.[QWERTY123]great spot for my trip.
easy in and out. everything i needed for a quick stay!"	40.70185618600252	-73.92744979135558	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/11708	2	85.0	0.8735
83	12048	"I stayed at Ben's place for 3 nights. It was my first time in NYC and Ben kept in touch with me since I booked the place about 2 weeks prior to my arrival. We also spoke on the phone. I already kind of knew Ben before arrival. It was a very secure feeling. He was also helpful when my wireless didn't work. He let me hook on to his broadband. 

Ben's place is very clean and warm. Totally noise free. Double security doors on the ground floor. Commuting also very easy. F train is just 30 yards away from his door. There is grocery shop and McDonald's on the ground floor. I walked to Wall street, South Sea Port, Bodies exhibition, Brooklyn brg and all from him place. No complaint whatsoever. I will stay with him next time.[QWERTY123]Ben was awesome! Had a great time staying at his place. Very friendly and inviting. Great apartment, great location and super close to subway station, chinatown and Lower East Side. Sorry about the early wake up the first day Ben! Thanks again![QWERTY123]I spent a real great time at Ben's apartment. Ben is a real good host. The location is really good, close to the subway and good restaurants and bars. Ben helps you make you feel confortable and fine, it is really helpful when you come for the first time in a place you don't know. I will send my friends there if they ask me where to sleep in NYC!! Trust me this is a real good adress with a real good person. Thanks again Ben, we meet us in Paris next time, take care![QWERTY123]Ben is a great host. His pad was perfect for my stay in the city. Strong recommendation from me![QWERTY123]I travel to NYC from time to time and my time spent at Ben's place was just right. He was courteous and pleasant and very easy to get along with. If you are looking for a low cost stay in NYC and don't plan on spending a lot of time indoors, this place is for you![QWERTY123]Ben is a real gentleman and is very accommodating. This was my first time using airbnb and it was a great experience. The apartment itself is very convenient to the F line subway;just a block away. This makes going over to Brooklyn easy (especially DUMBO, one stop away), and the East Village is just two stops uptown.[QWERTY123]Ben is definitively a Gentleman. Very nice and helpful. I could even extend my stay at the last minute with no problem.
His place is very clean and sharing the appt with him went smooth. Perfect for short term stay.[QWERTY123]Ben is a great host. Very gentle, easygoing and helpful.
I really felt at home at his place.
He told me a lot of things about the neighborhood. Perfect for a short term stay![QWERTY123]Ben is really great, told me about all the cool places to go to in NY, and also the best places to go out at night. Was very patient and kind, though I gave him some troubles. His apartment is really nice, like 10 feet from a subway, and the bed was also very comfy   :-)
Hope to come again.[QWERTY123]Ben is a great host. I stayed at his place while I was looking for an apartment. He made me feel right at home. If your tight on cash this is a fantastic option![QWERTY123]Ben was great. He's really friendly and personable and his daybed is comfortable to sleep on. His place is right by the subway, so it's easy to get to.[QWERTY123]Very nice host, clean quiet apartment.  Literally only steps from the subway and very easy to get to/from JFK as well.  I would definitely stay here again.[QWERTY123]I loved staying with Ben!  We got on famously and I really missed his company after I left.  I stayed on his comfy couch, and although the apartment is small, I never felt uncomfortable.  Ben also kept it nice and cool in the NY heat.  Subway is a stones throw from the front door.  Awesome guy, great pad!  Ben, when you extend and build the Sammy Davis Jr Memorial Wing, I'm coming back to be your permanent room-mate!! Cheers and thanks again.     

 

[QWERTY123]Ben was a fantastic host.  I arrived in NYC at an ungodly hour, and Ben was gracious enough to rise early to greet me.  The apartment was in a great location.  Close to the subway, Chinatown and all the fun spots of the Lower East Side.  I plan on staying with Ben again.[QWERTY123]
 Ben was a brilliant host. His apartment is small; but should be perfect:as a whole for a couple or:as a share for a single.
  His place is on the lower east side. I think this gives the visitor a chance to experience the real Manhattan at a very affordable price. Accomodation in the more 'touristy' areas would not achieve this.
  Ben is completely helpful. I required a further place to stay on my last night-as his place was free for 3 nights only and I was staying in NYC for four nights-and Ben helped me find somewhere.
  Ben is very respectful of his guests. So it is important that anyone staying with him is equally respectful in turn.
 I had a great time in NYC; helped considerably by the use of Ben's safe, secure and well placed apartment.
I would highly recommend both him and his accommdation to thoughful,considerate and appreciative travellers.[QWERTY123]I had a great time at Ben's place. He keeps his flat clean and well designed. We had good conversations. I highly recommend it. It's an affordable price and LES is a very nice area. He'll give you advices for places, food, anything.[QWERTY123]I am a simple person, not a prince. So my demands are simple.

I stayed on the couch. The couch was fine for me. Ben's place is nicely located for people that want to experience New York living from the common person's point of view. It's in a narrow building conveniently located very close to subway stop East Broadway on the F line. Ben's place is in an Asian and Hispanic area, which was fascinating for me because of the food. I went in early October so it was not hot nor cold. Ben's place is clean by normal international standards. If you're one of those that uses air-purifiers, carries germacide, and also demands service because you're paying, stay at the Ritz-Carlton instead. 

As for Ben, he's a nice easygoing guy. Good roomate. Sleeps late, wakes up early. His presence is only felt when he sits in the armchair to watch some TV and chat a while with his guests. If he wakes up before you do, he knows how to leave quietly without waking you up. He has an interesting cultural background and he's a good conversationalist. I liked the pics he had on the wall (Classic magazine covers). He's also a helpful guy when it comes to travel tips.

In all, Ben is a fine guy as a roommate, and his place will be fine for you if you are an open-minded, simple and easygoing person.[QWERTY123]Ben was a great host and I really liked the convenient location in the Lower East Side. The apartment was small but clean and affordable. Ben was very helpful and informative and accommodating.[QWERTY123]It was great time in NYC, Ben is great host. Helped me in everything, told me about all places that I need to see and how to get there. The apartment is in a good location, 1 min. to subway.
Take care Ben![QWERTY123]It was Great to stay at Ben´s Place !! The place is Small but for One person is More than Enough. Ben was very helpful all the Time and gave me Suggestions of Places and Transportation. Thank you Ben !![QWERTY123]It was pleasure for me to stay at Ben's place. He's very communicable and helpful person. The apartment is very comfortable, clean and tidy. It also well situated just near the downtown and the subway station. I highly recommend everyone who search an accommodation for awhile in NY to stay at Ben's place as well as I will do next time visiting NY.[QWERTY123]staying at ben LES apartment was a great experience!  not only was the place comfortable and homey, the apartment was located very centrally and allowed easy acces to all the downtown hotspots by foot plus access to trains that could take you anywhere else you needed to around manhattan.  i highly recommend ben as a host!
[QWERTY123]Ben is a really great guy. Friendly, helpful, outgoing and considerate. I had a lot of fun staying at his place and can highly recommend anyone to stay there.
[QWERTY123]Ben a very gracious host. Talked with him until late at night then got up at 9 to begin the day.  Couch comfortable enough, apartment quiet and low key. Good stay, highly recommended.[QWERTY123]Ben is a great host - a thoroughly nice guy and very generous and accomodating. His apartment is also really nice, excellent value for money and ideal for the lone traveller. His place is also right next to the Subway so its easy to get around NYC from there too. I would definitely recommend both Ben as a host to anyone looking for a place to stay in New York.

Thanks Ben and hope to see you again next time I'm in NYC,
Tom[QWERTY123]Had a great stay in New York City with Ben.  Friendly, comfortable and convenient to the subway.[QWERTY123]Ben was a great host, and was quite supportive of my recent relocation to this town. I stayed a week with him, and slept better at his place for than I had in weeks! And his place is in a great, central location, easy to get to,  and out of.[QWERTY123]That was my first time I came to US. So, I knew not too much and
really needed some hints on local life. And the help I have got from
Ben was just above any of my expectations. Not only all my questions
were anwsered, he always shared useful information with me and was
interesting how I am doing and was always ready to support if
necessary.

Of course, I tried to bother him as little as possible, as he had his
own things to do. But as a totally new in the city and as far not
perfect in English I know I brought some inconvinience to the great
host - Ben. Sorry!

Also when I could not get some of my stuff in time, he personally
 came to airport to bring it to me before I leave by which just saved
 me. To say I really appreciate this is to say nothing.
First that I will always remember about the NYC is Ben.

Ah, yes, the apartment is very cozy, literally 30 secs to subway
station, very secure and (what appeared to be a big advantage) near
to Chinatown.

Highly recommended.[QWERTY123]Ben had been a very nice guest. The apartment is very well located and clean.. Perfect ! nothing to add
[QWERTY123]Ben replied quickly to my reservation request at short notice and was very responsive to messages. He was also accommodating to my travel plans.

The apartment was clean, tidy and in a great location just next to the subway. I really enjoyed my stay.[QWERTY123]Ben was a great host and this is a good value for NY.

It's definitely on the small side-- I was worried when I arrived but I got used to it quickly and it wasn't really an issue.[QWERTY123]Ben is a teriffic host and a total sweetheart. His place is minutes from the lower east side, financial district and right off the F which will take you all over the place. Ben keeps his place clean, is fun to talk to and hang out with while also letting you do your own thing.  Best value in Manhattan![QWERTY123]Ben was very friendly and accommodating during my stay. This was my first time visiting New York and he gave me a lot of good tips about navigating through Manhattan. The location of his apartment was conveniently located near public transportation which made it easy for me to get to other neighborhoods. I was recommend his apartment to my friends and would surely stay there again.

Thanks Ben![QWERTY123]Ben was the ultimate host.  His personality works well for this kind of adventure.  Like a concierge, his insights into the city and neighborhood become invaluable suggestions on how to enjoy a brief or longer stay in the city.  I'm a 10 year resident of Manhattan and was looking for a respite on a summer weekend.  And I thought I knew all about the city.  Well, Ben reminded me of just how much there is to learn and about how much fun it is to be in Manhattan!  Thanks Ben![QWERTY123]I had a great stay at Ben,s place, it was a great location with easy access to everything you would want to see in NYC. Ben was helpful in everyway and even provided a mobile phone during my stay which made things very easy.

Ben is a good friend now and hope to see him again.[QWERTY123]Ben was a great host, very easy going.  The apartment is a bit small but Ben was considerate of the space and kept things quiet and relaxed in the mornings and evenings.  I was in NYC for work so I was not in the apartment during the day.  The location was good, especially convenient to the subway, going out in the East Village and the Lower East Side. Great price as well.  I would stay here again.[QWERTY123]Ben was very friendly and communicative from day one. Unfortunately I had to cancel my stay last minute, but judging from our email exchange it would have been a comfortable stay. I would definitely stay with Ben next time I´m in town.[QWERTY123]I had a very good stay with welcome and help from Ben.
He was very friendly and for my first time visiting New York it was a big help for navigation. With the location of his apartment, near the F train, it's easy to go to Manhattan or Brooklyn. I'll recommend this apartment and I hope go a second time in the future. Thanks for all Ben![QWERTY123]Was moving to NYC and Ben's hospitality and space was just perfect.  His space was clean, well organized and adequate for my needs (a 2-week stay). Oh, and did I mention how close to the Subway was? Just a block away, which made getting home a breeze.  Would definitely book again if need be. Thanks.[QWERTY123]Ben was a wonderful and gracious host.  His apartment and my bed were clean, comfortable and worth every penny-a bargain as far as I am concerned.  On my next trip to NYC, Ben will be my first choice for accommodations.[QWERTY123]Ben was a great host! I chose the couch and it was honestly more comfortable than my own bed. He was very respectful of my messed up partying sleep schedule, haha. Really cool and nice guy, and extremely reliable to contact as well as knowledgeable of the city. Location is great as every day I walked to go meet my friends. You WILL NOT find a cheaper place to stay in Lower East Side. I recommend Ben's place all the way.[QWERTY123]Ben is amazing! He is so friendly and so accommodating with his time and his space. His space, by the way, is very conveniently located, very clean and very cozy. (He even didn't mind when I stayed up watching ""Pretty Woman"" all night!) Extremely flexible and easy going, Ben made for the perfect host. When I first saw the place, I couldn't beat the price, but now that I know Ben, the host, I know that you can't beat his southern-rooted NYC hospitality. I would certainly stay here again![QWERTY123]I stayed at Ben's for 4 days & nights. Ben proved a warm, welcoming, well-informed host. The Couch, apart from providing me with the best sleep during my trip in the US, was a good place for sharing personal stories and interests too, both of which Ben has in abundance. Add the location and his good taste for food (& coffee!) and it's not hard to understand why I rated my stay so highly.[QWERTY123]Ben was a great host. When I arrived to NY I knew nothing about it. Ben gave me key tips to grasp the best out of my five-day stay in the city. He was very respectful of privacy and very quite. The apartment was small but enough :). It is only 50 meters away from the East Broadway subway station (line F). Internet worked perfectly (quite a concern for me :)). I would definitively stay again there. Thanks Ben![QWERTY123]Ben was a great host and provided a great subway map which helped me navigate the city.

Although I spent most of our time out, the conversations we had were great ! He was extremely helpful throughout the entire process. He was very responsive to e-mails and very helpful with checkout or when I picked up the keys. His place is clean, quiet and comfortable as described. This apartment puts you in the heart of the LES, where you can walk anywhere and find something awesome. You can find almost everything in the same block and the subway is located at the corner of the street. You get exactly what you expect -, a/c and wifi.  I'd highly recommend Ben and his place ! Definitely a good place to go for a cheap stay in NYC. Great price and location. I couldn't have asked for a better experience. Thank you Ben.
[QWERTY123]It was a short period of time in ny, but Ben made it much more exciting than i would think. Ben was always willing to answer every question and give useful directions.

Thanks for the Stay![QWERTY123]I stayed on Ben's sofa for five nights in September and loved it! the location cannot be beaten, you can literally walk anywhere in the downtown area plus it's so close to the subway. The sofa is comfortable and the apartment is clean and well maintained. Ben himself is a lovely person, so kind and knowledgable about New York and I hope to meet him again some day! If and when I come back to NYC, I hope to have the opportunity to stay with Ben again, five stars.[QWERTY123]I was only staying at Ben's place for one night as i was passing through NYC, However is was very enjoyable, Ben was a fantastic host and a great guy, very helpful with any question i asked or anything i needed,  would really recommend others to stay here as the location is also great.[QWERTY123]Ben was very friendly and considerate and made me feel welcome.

He's an interesting guy, and I'd certainly stay there again if the opportunity came up.[QWERTY123]Ben was a very accommodating and thoughtful host. The apartment was in a great location for wanting to explore Manhattan for a couple of days. The couch was reasonably comfortable and facilities were good.

The sofa was good to sleep. The apartment is a bit small, but the location is pretty good, near the train station. It was worth staying there.[QWERTY123]Ben's flat is exactly as described, and a great place to stay. Ben is a  good and very accommodating host, and I recommend him highly. I am tall (6'3"" for Americans, 192 CM for everyone else) and I fit well onto the couch, so hopefully that allays any concerns that one may have about the flat. I highly recommend him as a host and his flat for your visiting needs.[QWERTY123]Absolutely perfect. I had a fantastic weekend here. Ben was a fantastic host and really went out of his way to help me enjoy my time in NYC. He gave me lots of information prior to my trip and was extremely helpful while I was there.

Was a great experience thanks to Bens hospitality and I can't wait to go back. The apartment is in a great spot too. Would thoroughly recommend. Thanks Ben.[QWERTY123]Super nice guy and great LES location. Cant beat it for the price.[QWERTY123]Had a wonderful stay at ben' place. He's a very kind and easygoing guy. His place is very close to metro , line F or you can even walk lower Manhattan if you like .[QWERTY123]Stayed on his couch for one night on a layover in New York. Perfect for a one night stay where all you need is a simple place to sleep on. Couch was comfortable and Ben was really helpful, giving tips of where what I could do in the very short time I was in NY and was ok with me checking out a little later and I'm really grateful for that. Recommended for ppl staying just one short night as stopover and are on a budget[QWERTY123]Ben was a great host. I booked his apartment for a friend of mine on a very short notice. Although Ben's apartment wasn't available, he made the arrangements for my friend, Carlos,  to stay with him at his friend's place. Carlos had no complaints whatsoever and enjoyed his stay.[QWERTY123]Ben is an interesting and convivial host.  The apartment is clean and the sofa is comfortable.  It is in a safe lighted neighborhood.[QWERTY123]My stay at Ben's place was a brief one, but it went really well and smoothly. Ben is really cool, he's helpful and well experienced with the AirBnB thing.  
I slept on the sofa - its a good size.  I'm about 5 foot 9, and I wasn't squashed at all.  The location is awesome - you're just 5-10 minutes walk from some really hip bars/restaurants.
So I can recommend Ben's place for a nice cheap stay in NY. One thing that might be worth mentioning - there is no A/C.  I would imagine the heat might be a little overwhelming during a heatwave.  He  does have a fan though!
Ben - if you're ever in Melbourne feel free to look me up for a beer.
[QWERTY123]It was a great short stay and I would recommend Ben's place to everyone. It is conveniently located beside the subway station (2 minutes walk), I a walkable distance to Financial District, Manhattan Bridge, Brooklyn Bridge and East Village. Very safe location.

The place is small, but comfortable with everything you may need for a short stay. It is also clean and everything has its own place there. The place looks exactly like on the pictures.

Ben is a great story teller.

Highly recommended.[QWERTY123]Ben accommodated me with a very last minute booking, with a prompt and kind response to get me set up with my first Airbnb experience. He was super kind and nice to talk to, very flexible with anything I needed. Any superstition I had with using Airbnb was totally set at ease at once, thanks to him.

Ben's place is perfect for the person looking for a place to crash in a comfortable and accessible locale. I had everything I needed, and felt at home. Would stay with Ben again without question. Highly recommended.[QWERTY123]I had a wonderful time staying with Ben! He is a great host, a very nice person and nice to talk to!

I will go back next time I am in New York![QWERTY123]Ben was a fantastic host. He's a really kind and helpful person, and was exceptionally accommodating. The apartment is really nice, cosy and clean, with really cool decorations all around, and not once did it feel uncomfortable sharing the space. Will be in touch next time I visit NY for sure.[QWERTY123]The stay in NYC at Ben's accomodation was wonderful. Ben makes you feel like home the minute you get to his appartment. He is very welcoming and tells you a lot about the city and what to see. The appartment is very central and there is a subway station just around the corner. I enjoyed the stay at Ben's place a lot and would choose to stay there again. If you are looking for a cheap, nice and central place in Nw York I can 100 percently recommend to stay at Ben's place.[QWERTY123]Stayed for just one night - Ben was a great host. He was very accommodating with both a very late check in time and early check out due to my odd travel itinerary. There was a small mix up with booking, so I ended up staying at his friend's place, which was very clean and easy to get to via subway. Overall, the experience was very smooth and Ben was very clear about details every step of the booking. I highly recommend him as a host.[QWERTY123]Ben was an absolutely fantastic host! Really enjoyed getting to know him as he was very personable and interesting in making new friends. I chose his place because of the excellent reviews and I'm happy to say everything I read was true.

Thanks much![QWERTY123]Ben is a great host, very friendly and laid back.  Feels more like hanging out with a buddy than being in an unfamiliar place.

Hope to be back, would definitely recommend.[QWERTY123]I really enjoyed my stay at Ben's place. Ben responds all the time fast to messages or email and it is very easy to arrange a 'check in' with him. His apartment is small, but everything you'll need for a stay is there.

I highly recommend Ben's place when you visit New York![QWERTY123]Le séjour n'a pas eu lieu car mon vol à été annulé, or je suis arrivé un jour plus tard. Air B&B doit faire des progrès encore, pas de possibilité de remboursement en un clic si le séjour n'a pas eu lieu pour des causes majeurs, j'ai négocié 50/50 avec l'hôte, comment je fais pour être remboursé ??[QWERTY123]Ben is an great host! He really is friendly and respectful. The place is located right next to a subway station which makes it very convenient. I enjoyed my stay very much, thanks![QWERTY123]Ben was great. He was able to accept my last-minute request, a major life-saver. In addition the apartment is warm and cozy, and the sofa/bed makes for a great sleep! The apartment is a block away from the F, and a short walk to Canal Street. I would recommend this spot to anyone.[QWERTY123]Ben was a great host. He gave me keys to come and go as I please. The location was great for lower manhattan area. The space was very clean. I would stay here again.[QWERTY123]Hi. Ben was an awesome host, always willing to go out of his way to help his guests, in this case, me. Apartment is exactly as advertised- small, cozy, and comfortable living. Ben is more than happy with you using the kitchen, cooking and using it as your own home. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a short term stay in New York.[QWERTY123]Everything as the description, thank you, ben![QWERTY123]The reservation was canceled 82 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.[QWERTY123]Ben is a person who you could spend hours talking with about everything. An easy-going guy that makes your experience at his worth a lot. The apt is less than half block from the F train which takes you to all nice places in manhattan, such as soho, west village, midtown, etc. If you feel like walking, chinatown, little italy, and financial district are all around. Just cross the street in front of his building and you'll see the one world trade center and the beautifull bridges that ride you to brooklyn. Hope I can stay there again. LES is such a nice place to be.
Thank you Ben!
Abraços
Rodrigo[QWERTY123]Very good[QWERTY123]Mr. Arredondo is an excellent host. He is very thoughtful towards his guest's needs. I was unable to stay the full night at his place, but I would absolutely recommend him to anyone in need of a simple and practical place to stay in Manhattan.[QWERTY123]My stay with Ben made the trip to New York as good as I could have hoped. The apartment is no frills but a great location and great value. Being right off the subway you can get anywhere in the city easily and quickly. 

Ben was a great host as well--flexible, accommodating, friendly, open, and helpful. As a solo traveler for the first time, he helped make my trip much more enjoyable and interesting. Though he was quite busy during my stay, he took the time to provide me recommendations and was genuinely interested in my trip.

As a solo traveler in NYC, it's hard to imagine a better value accommodation.[QWERTY123]Stayed one night. Ben was very easy to communicate with! He was hosting a film festival - wish I could stay longer and attend![QWERTY123]First time in NYC and first time with Airbnb. NY is a great city, but staying with Ben was even better. The appartment was clean and in a great location. I had the chance to have a beer with him and watch a movie in Bryant park (Ben saved a spot for me during 3 hours while I was doing tourism). He is simply a fantastic guy.[QWERTY123]Ben is a great guy and a wonderful host.  Very easy going and was so helpful throughout my stay.

Easy going, friendly and accessible. The location was perfect also, being literally a few steps from the subway. Id have no hesitation recommending him to friends and will definitely book with Ben next time im in town[QWERTY123]Ben is an excellent host. Throughout the stay, he always behaved more like a close friend than as someone who rents you part of his home.
He was always willing to help me or give me advice on the city when I needed them and really made much more enjoyable my presence in New York.
The appartment location and neighborhood is excellent to, you have the metro half block away and I came back late some nights and is completely safe.
Totally recommended, especially if you are traveling alone. Is my first experience through airbnb and it was incredibly good.


Ben es un excelente anfitrión. Durante toda la estadía siempre fue más un amigo que una persona que te alquila parte de su casa.
Siempre estuvo dispuesto a ayudarme o darme consejos respecto de la ciudad y realmente hizo muchísima mas agradable mi presencia en New York.
El barrio y la localización del departamento también son excelentes, tenes el metro a media cuadra y aunque algunas noches volví algo tarde la zona es completamente segura.
Total y completamente recomendable, especialmente si estas viajando solo. Esta fue mi primer experiencia en airbnb y fue increíblemente buena.[QWERTY123]Everything worked out well! Was a good place to stay, easy to get to.[QWERTY123]Ben was a very nice host. We had nice conversation and gave us very good advices about the city.

Best regards[QWERTY123]The best of airbnb in the whole of New York, u get the best hospitality for the little u pay..highly recommended for short stays..Ben is super cool guy with a taste of world cinema :)[QWERTY123]Ben was great and his place is cozy and in a very cool part of town. It's too bad I didn't get to stay longer, but I would definitely stay here again.[QWERTY123]Ben really made my stay at his place easy, I could dispose of his apartment at my convenience and he was very nice to me, thus I really felt at home. Each time I have had a problem or a request (which were not linked to him or his flat) he offered to help me immediately.
His flat cannot be closer to the subway, which is very convenient, and Manhattan and Brooklyn can be accessed walking (which I did most of the time). I slept very well at his place, therefore I had great vacations in New York. Definitely recommending Ben’s apartment, it was a great experience![QWERTY123]I stayed only for one night but i would choose Ben's place anytime again.

A perfect host![QWERTY123]The best place I could have had in NYC. Pretty close to the subway, Chinatown and Little Italy. Ben's apartement is really nice arranged and comfortable. I like his style and felt homey. I am happy and thankful that I could stay at Ben's place. Even if was out of town we kept in touch and he offered to help .

I definitely will come again :)[QWERTY123]Ben was very polite, friendly, and responsive in all our communications.

Marw[QWERTY123]Ben was an exceptional host.  My booking was last minute, but it was quick and easy getting to the Lower East Side -- especially so with Ben's directions.

Cozy space and no concerns about dirtiness.  A solid airbnb option in downtown Manhattan.
[QWERTY123]A good man.[QWERTY123]Ben was a perfect host!. He helped me from the first time in NY, even before, explaining me how to find the apartment from the airport. He asked everyday about myself during the trip and always ensuring I was having a good time. Honestly I can't say a bad word about him. 10/10 Guest!  THANK YOU BEN!! =)

[QWERTY123]I can't say enough good things about staying with Ben. The listing is accurate and Ben has been with AirBnB for 5 years so he knows what he is doing and more importantly knows NYC inside and out. He made my feel right at home and was very helpful in getting me directions to his place.  The location is very safe and close to the subway and Citibike. People like Ben are what make NYC such a pleasure to visit as a first timer or regular.[QWERTY123]Excellent host. Very organized, responsive professional.  Apartment as described. I was on pull out couch and it was very comfortable![QWERTY123]Ben is very welcoming and thoughtful landlord, I had an amazing time in NYC and his apt definitely contributed a lot!

Definitely check out the neighborhood, lots of really awesome diners and delis (Dimes, Pies 'n' Things, etc.)[QWERTY123]Ben was very friendly and welcoming host. He responded quickly to all our questions and we received thorough instructions for everything. Ben also shared some tips about local restaurants and the like. Beer enthusiasts should check out Top Hops for sure. The neighbourhood was nice and there was plenty of shops to get some breakfast etc.  Would definitely recommend staying here, good location and very cost effective.[QWERTY123]Staying at Ben's pleasure was a pleasure! From the moment I arrived Ben greeted me and gave me some information the area, place to eat, and how the transpiration was in NY. As it was my first experience at an airbnb, i couldn't ask for a better place and host.

Thank you Ben for hosting me in NY![QWERTY123]Ben was very friendly and helpful and the apartment was conveniently located. Would recommend.[QWERTY123]Ben is a great host.

I would definitely return, the apartment is clean, in a great location and is priced very reasonably.
Ben also helped me navigate to and from the airport/ the apartment which was very helpful![QWERTY123]Staying at Ben's apartment in Madison St. was really great, very convenient since it is literally few steps away from the F train, the area is relatively safe I felt comfortable going back to the apartment at night or even after midnight. Despite being very busy for work, Ben was very friendly and accommodating, he also gave me privacy in my space. Definitely will book his apartment again. Overall it is a very reasonable and good experience staying at Ben's apartment, I would recommend his place if you will be out most of the time and if you have a tight budget but wants to have a decent and comfortable stay plus Ben also responds quickly to queries. Thanks Ben![QWERTY123]Ben is a great host. His apartment was perfect for my stay in the city. Strong recommendation from me![QWERTY123]I can only second everyone else.

Highly recommended.[QWERTY123]Ben is such a nice host, he always cared about me and asking if everything was alright. 
The list of the stuff is accurate, the neighborhood is not that good, but it's not bad either. 
The subway station is just a block away, that's very nice.

The apartment was clean and cozy, perfect for a solo traveler who wants to spend time exploring the city.[QWERTY123]Ben is really nice and helpful. His apartment is clean, comfortable, and it's so close to the East Broadway subway station (F train).[QWERTY123]If Bens place is free, book it. For his unbeatable price you basically get everything you could want from a sleeper couch - plus some nice conversation :)
Nice and clean room, bath, kitchen, towels, shampoo... if I'm in Manhattan again, I sure hope this couch is free again![QWERTY123]Great location! Friendly host[QWERTY123]A great place with a great host.[QWERTY123]Ben se porto muy bien desde el principio. Me recibió antes del tiempo estipulado y sin ningún problema.

The stay was great. Good hospitality. Location is next to the subway station.[QWERTY123]Séjour pour une nuit très bien pour le rapport qualité prix.

Let us check in and check out when we wanted to, provided directions for getting to his home, and just accommodated us kindly. His place was very close to public transportation as well, so that we could access most of Manhattan easily. Overall, very pleasant stay.[QWERTY123]El departamento es tal como se ve en las fotos. Ben es muy agradable. La ubicación para mi es muy buena dado que está muy cerca del metro.[QWERTY123]Ben es muy buen anfitrión. Me hizo sentir como en mi casa.

He is easy going and helpful with hints about places to eat or see in the area. His place is in a great location as well. For this area, it is a great value to get an Airbnb at a reasonable price with a wonderful host. He does a great job communicating about directions, which is awesome. You can't go wrong with Ben![QWERTY123]Ben is really easy going guy and nice host. There was no problem. 
The couch is really comfy. 
Subway is in reach in a few steps. 
All good.[QWERTY123]Conviviale et pratique. C'est une bonne alternative a une auberge de jeunesse. Je recommande.[QWERTY123]Perfect ubication. Good place for staying. Ben is so kind, he helped me during my trip.[QWERTY123]NA[QWERTY123]very nice place[QWERTY123]Ben's apartment is extremely well located, either to get around by subway or walking. The neighborhood is safe and basic services are all really close by. The apartment itself is clean and compact and the sofa bed extremely comfortable. All in all a great stay and real value for money ![QWERTY123]Ben has the most amazing location in Downtown NY
The apartment is just 1minute walking distance to the subway & 5 minutes away from China Town
Well connected by Public Transport & it takes just 10 minutes to reach all the major tourist locations in Manhattan[QWERTY123]Todo genial!  Ben está pendiente de todo,  queda súper cerca al tren. Muy recomendando.[QWERTY123]A very cozy apartment. Very near to the Brooklyn Bridge and Manhattan Bridge. Might be appropriate to those who visit to Brooklyn.[QWERTY123]Ben is a great host and his place was a great value and location.[QWERTY123]Ideal para el viajero ahorrativo. Tiene todo lo esencial, está muy cerca del metro y Ben no sólo es un anfitrión amigable y atento, sino que también da buenas recomendaciones de lugares para visitar según lo que pretenda cada uno.
Los únicos puntos negativos en mi opinión son que el departamento es muy pequeño así que no se esperen privacidad. Además los vecinos son un poco ruidosos.[QWERTY123]Ben was the man! My experience at Bens air bnb started much before my arrival to his comfy apartment. He was an amazing communicator, giving me tips on food and travel. When I got to his place he hooked me up with everything I needed. We stayed up half the night chillen talking about movies and watching tv. 10/10 experience and happy to say I made a friend along the way.[QWERTY123]Ben was really nice, he cared about our comfort and the questions we had. He knows very well the city at daylife and nightlife. I definitely can recommend his place if you want to stay in NYC for a low price and in a very good location inside manhattan.[QWERTY123]Lets say all his reviews are on point and he is actually a cooler dude than even mentioned here. As a matter of fact, he is my first friend here. Thanks Ben![QWERTY123]The room has everything a vistor to NYC on a budget can ask for. Ben is a very friendly and relaxed host. It was a great time![QWERTY123]Great place, close to public transportation and walkable distance to some of the beautiful neighbourhood and some of the best coffee venues.[QWERTY123]Clean and nice apartment with a truly great host![QWERTY123]Es un apartamento pequeño, pero limpio, muy bien ubicado en el bajo manhatan,  muy buena accesibilidad por cualquier medio de transporte, es un buen lugar para pasar una noche o un corto tiempo en NY, el precio es acorde a lo que ofrecen, y el anfitrión es bastante amable y da muy buen seguimiento al momento de la llegada. Es muy recomendable para quien no busca lujo sino un lugar de descanso a un buen precio.[QWERTY123]As someone visiting NY alone, this was a perfect central location for exploring the city! Ben was incredibly welcoming throughout my stay and provided me with useful hints on getting around the city using public transport. If your looking to visit NY on a budget and would like to situated in a great location close to the subway, then this is a no-brainer :)[QWERTY123]Ben is very quick in responding. The space is small but very neat and well organized. I did not miss anything. Very close to Metro and the place is perfect for short/overnight trips.[QWERTY123]Really great place. Just what I was looking for.[QWERTY123]Ben is a great host! Everything was amazing![QWERTY123]Great place and great host, you can’t go wrong![QWERTY123]Great space, host, and value.

Amenities/space are as described,  except for a steep set of stairs.

Ben was very responsive - and wants to make sure your stay is comfortable and easy.

Highly recommend host and space."	40.71400913024212	-73.98917149022176	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/12048	1	35.0	0.86
84	24285	"I was staying with Brenda wit my whole family and we had a wonderful time. We had last minute changes in number of travelers and they adapted to our needs quickly. Great neighborhood and very close to the metro stop.[QWERTY123]Overall:
For the price, this is an exceptional rental.  It was absolutely spotless with seemingly brand new sheets, towels, and matresses.  It has everything you would need but can't compare with vastly more expensive luxury accomodations.  If we go back to New York, we will stay here again - unless we win the lottery and have tons of money to throw around.  

The good points:
Super clean, has everything you will need (mini refrigerators in most rooms, small microwaves, closet space, TVs, wireless internet, etc.), close to food and shops, seems like a safe location, very friendly owners, no hassle with the return of the deposit, CHEAP for N.Y., very well maintained, just off the main streets (less traffic noise).

The bad points:
A little far for someone elderly to get to the subway (6 blocks), steep stairs to climb inside, more utilitarian than luxurious or romantic, if you're sensitive to noise the floors do squeek and sound from above does transmit easily.  

Basically if you have trouble walking a few blocks or if you're looking for a romantic getaway, this isn't for you.  For everyone else, it should be perfect.[QWERTY123]Our family of 7 adults enjoyed a great week together in this Brooklyn brownstone. It was spotlessly clean, there was enough space, the kitchen was well supplied, the beds were very comfortable, and there were plenty of linens. The location was safe, great for getting food or eating out, and close enough to the subway stations. We really liked the Brooklyn Bakery, the Brooklyn Ale House, and a great Italian pizza place on 5th Ave. Brenda's son, Brandon, was always ready to help us with any question or problem, and even called for taxis for us when it was time to leave. We highly recommend this vacation rental.[QWERTY123]We were in NY for the weekend of Jan 21 and our group of 8 had a very comfortable stay at Brenda's Brooklyn apartment. The place is very clean and neat. It is very spacious and to be honest the pictures don't really do it justice. The rooms are pretty private - and having 3 bathrooms is great!
We didn't really get to meet Brenda but her son Brendon met us at the door and was very nice and helpful. A working wireless internet connection and televisions with cable also proved to be pretty good for surfing and watching when we were not heading out to the city.
All in all a great experience![QWERTY123]We enjoy our stay very much. The apartment is new, very clean. Brenda's son Brandon i very pleasant and helpful. We rent the entire house for 8 of us,  the owner stays on the first floor, we have the 2nd and 3rd floor, each room has own bath with shower/tub except the 3rd floor 2 rooms share one full bathroom. However, if you can't climb stairs comfortably you may find it very hard to stay there especially on the 3rd floor, since you need to climb 46 steps to get there and the stairs are steep. To get in the house, you have to climb 10 steps from  the street, then each floor 18 steps, so if you stay in 3rd floor that is 46 steps. If you have heavy luggage, it is a challenge to drag up all the steps to get to 3rd floor. The kitchen, living room and dinning room are on the 3rd floor, Each room has its own air condition, TV and ceiling fan which is great for the summer. Rooms on 2nd floor have a microwave,  and a small fridge, so you don't have to go up to  the kitchen often. The subway is about 6 blocks from the apartment. The area looks safe, but at night we were careful to go in group only. There are many shops  nearby to buy grocery, laudromat, restaurant, cafe. It takes 45-50 minutes by subway to go to Manhattan inluding walk to subway station. We did not have a car, street parking is very hard to find. Overall it is a great clean place to stay when visit NYC.[QWERTY123]We seven adults enjoyed the apartment, perhaps we will book again in the future.  /Tomas[QWERTY123]Great duplex! Idéal pour 6 personnes! Confort, propreté, indépendance et nécessaire fourni à 10 minutes des métros dans un quartier charmant. Nous avons passé une belle semaine à Park Slope![QWERTY123]Excellent location, friendly hosts, comfortable accommodation, prompt return of deposit.  We would recommend it![QWERTY123]I live in New York and at the start of December seven members of my family came to visit me for five days. We rented this duplex two months in advance. brenda was very quick to reply to any of our questions and requests. when we arrived we were met by val, her husband, who was also very accomidating to our needs. with four large bedrooms comfortably sleeping nine, we had ample room, feeding and entertaining thirteen for our christmas dinner. the apartment is warm, clean and well finished. my entire family and i were more the happy with our week spent at 373 r4th st. and we completely recommend this apartment to any family of all ages.Dave[QWERTY123]If you are looking for a nice, clean apartment in a quiet neighborhood, look no further. We rented Brenda's apartment for 7 days and we were extremely pleased. Our host Brandon was very friendly and said we could always knock on the door (1st floor) if we had any questions.

The whole apartment was clean, the rooms were all pretty big, wi-fi worked perfectly, ... We really had no remarks.

The nearest subway station is about a ten minute walk away and there are a few supermarkets nearby the apartment.

If we ever go back to New York (and I'm sure we will!) we'll definitely reconsider staying at Brenda's again. And so should you.[QWERTY123]This is a really comfortable place to stay, in a great location. The apartment is really comfortable and nicely furnished. You have everything you need. Brenda and her family could not be easier to work with and more accommodating. We were based here the entire week leading up to our wedding, and it was awesome. This will definitely be our home away from home whenever we are in Brooklyn. Thank you Bryce family![QWERTY123]Our extended family of 8 had a wonderful stay at Brenda's  apt. It is absolutely beautiful and clean with lots of personal space for sleeping. It has all of the amenities that anyone would want while visiting New York City. Brenda's husband, Val, was wonderful to work with and very helpful. We highly recommend Beautiful Duplex Apartment.[QWERTY123]We had six people staying here for a wedding, and it was perfect! Two of the rooms were more like suites, and the other two were connected to the communal kitchen and living room so we could all still hang out. They accommodated our different flight times well, and made sure we had everything we needed for our stay.[QWERTY123]9 of us stayed 2 nights and we were very pleased with everything.  Val, Brenda's husband, took care of us with a proud smile as he had created each room.  Everything was spacious and clean, clean, clean.
The kitchen was stocked with great dishes and glasses,which we used as we were celebrating a wedding all weekend long. 
The friends and family were perfect, the weather was perfect and this apartment was perfect.[QWERTY123]Great apartment
Very clean and a lot of space
We visited the apartment with a group of six peolple and enjoyed the whole ten days.
Only 5 minutes to the metro and only 30 min to Manhattan.

Thanks a lot for the great time[QWERTY123]Seven of us stayed in the duplex while we were in town for a wedding, and it was great. The apartment is in a great location, and the neighborhood is very walkable. The kitchen was also really well equipped, which made it easy for us to cook a couple of meals. I would definitely recommend this place![QWERTY123]Val helped us out at this location and he was great.  Very friendly and willing to help.  The place has 3 separate areas.  We rented all 3 and they were great spaces for a group of 9.  Cheaper than a hotel  with more room in a nice, family-friendly Brooklyn neighborhood.[QWERTY123]We stayed at Brenda's during May 2013; two married adults/ chaperones and 7 senior high school students from Northern Michigan on their senior class trip.   Brenda's turned out to be PERFECT for us.  We could trust the kids to walk around the neighborhood at night and not need to worry--it was great. 

Although we never met Brenda, her son Brandon got us set-up immediately upon our arrival.  He showed us the apartments and left us with good neighborhood and subway information and answered all of our questions.  The place was clean and spacious with air conditioners installed in each room.  Everything worked perfectly--we had no complaints at all--and compared with many other NYC rentals, it was a great deal!  Within a block's walking distance (2-5 minute walk), there was a bagel/coffee shop/bakery, which was perfect for morning, as well as a convenience market and pizza place, which were perfect for late night, and tons of restaurants and other shops.  The walk to the subway wasn't bad at all; maybe a 7-10 minute walk.  

I highly recommend this rental for anyone who wants the true experience of living in NYC.  We had a commute to get to ""the city,"" Manhattan, just like the average New Yorker, because the rental is in a beautiful, traditional Brownstone home in a great Brooklyn neighborhood.  When ever we were ready to head back to Brooklyn from the city for the night, we would just sit-back and enjoy the subway ride, which was about 30-40 minutes and then once we arrived, we were so happy for the serenity of being in a quieter, dimmer part of town instead of all the crazy lights and noise of the typical tourist destinations in Manhattan, where so many tourists also choose to stay.  Unfortunately, I don't think many NYC visitors get the full NYC experience because they stay so close to Times Square or the other major hubs.  We much preferred the quiet independence our Brooklyn neighborhood granted us in the evening/ nighttime and are happy people like Brenda and her family are renting such great places out of the main way of all the traffic and noise!  We would definitely stay there again![QWERTY123]Our stay at Brenda's was a wonderful experience!  We were greeted upon our arrival by Brendan, who welcomed us, answered our questions, provided us with a map and directions to the nearest subway station.  The accommodations suited our needs perfectly.  We were a party of 7 staying in Brooklyn for my daughter's wedding.  Everything was very clean and it was a high quality place to stay which also afforded us a lot of privacy.  I also found Brenda's to be very affordable.  I would happily stay here again, given the opportunity![QWERTY123]An absolute perfect stay. The apartment is cleaner than clean, comfortable, and practical. The kitchen  has all the needed essentials. Three bathrooms make a stay with several people easy. 
A very helpful Brandon greeted us and provided us with all the info needed. We had a couple of chats with Val and met Brenda once. Extremely nice family as well as professional and expirienced hosts.
The Apartment is a ten minute walk from and to two different subway lines, which are connected to every other line in town. A bus stop is just minutes from the house. Every store desirable is within a few minutes walk. The neighborhood felt very, very safe, even at night. The residents are many young families, everyone is friendly and helpful. A huge wonderful park and sport possibilities are just three minutes down the road. The rating for this place is a 12 out of 10 from us. ;-) Again i have to highlight the cleanliness of the place!!!!. We spent two weeks with family and friends and it felt like home!
Brandon, Anaiya, Jim and Martina[QWERTY123]We had a wonderful stay in this apartment, very beautiful and clean. Rooms are surely better than you can see in the pictures and we felt like home. Lovely experience.[QWERTY123]Met with Brenda's son Brandon.  He was great and gave us a good orientation of everything on arrival.  The duplex is huge and more than happily fit the 8 of us with room to spare!  With lots of bathrooms, even that wasn't a problem.  The rooms are so clean with plenty of fresh towels and blankets, it even had it's own self contained cupboard/tea/coffeemaking facilities/microwave and fridge which i didn't expect. Having multiple keys were essential as there were so many of us and was happy to find 2 keys for each individual room.  The area of Brooklyn is very safe and LOTs of great places to eat only a short walk away.  The subway is about 10-15mins walk but we usually grabbed breakfast at the diner on the way.  Would definitely stay again if in a large group![QWERTY123]Nous avons été agréablement surpris à notre arrivée.
L appartement est bien situé à 10 minutes à pied du métro dans un quartier calme.
Il est très grand , très propre avec tout le confort.
La literie est de bonnes qualité.
Le propriétaire nous a gardé les valises pendant une heure le jour du départ et à appelle un taxi pour nous.

C'est notre première expérience de réservation chez un particulier. On avait une petite crainte car nous partions loin
Merci à ""Airbnb"" , nous recommanderons votre site et l'utiliserons à nouveau pour nos prochaines vacances.[QWERTY123]Firstly we'd like to thank Brandon for staying op so late, waiting for our arrival.
He gave us a list of shops in the neighbourhood along with a bottle of water for each of us.
We were very lucky to have such a beautiful and comfortable place to stay.
We were with 6 persons and we had 3 beautiful bathrooms.
On the last day, our host stored our luggage in his place.
Too bad we didn’t get to meet Brenda, but her son Brandon was very helpful.
We sure can recommend staying in their nice home in Brooklyn.

[QWERTY123]The duplex was just as advertised.  Stayed for a week.  They allowed early check in.  Clean, roomy, very appropriate for a group of 5 high schoolers and 2 chaperones.  We could have easily had 2 more people staying there, did not even use one of the bedrooms.  Brandon was easy to deal with and he and Brenda gave us very helpful info by phone prior to visiting the city.  No complaints.  The apartment does not have a washer/dryer, and it's a 6 block or 10 minute walk to the subway, but we knew that prior to arrival.  With a $30 metro card, everything in the city is easily accessible. It rained 2 of the days we were there, which makes walking more of a downer, but overall, a very economical, safe and pleasant experience. We basically slept and ate breakfast at the duplex and were traveling in the city from 8Am to 11 or midnight each day.  Nice coffee and bagel shop on the same block and groceries 2 blocks away.[QWERTY123]Logement composé de 3 appartements indépendants (1T3 et 2 studios) le plus grand disposant d'une vraie cuisine. Très propre et dans un quartier très agréable, calme et avec beaucoup de commerces tout proche sur la 5th avenue (pizzeria chez Joe, glaces italiennes, épicerie...). Métro à seulement 10 min. à pied. Nous y retournerions avec plaisir.
NB:Brenda répond très rapidement à toutes questions.

3 very clean apartments in nice area, peaceful at nite and with everything you need near by on the fifth avenue. Metro station is only at a 10 min. walk. Would definitely consider staying there again for a future trip to NY.
Note: we appreciated the fact that Brenda always answered very quickly to all our questions before and after booking. Thanks ![QWERTY123]Our experience with this airbnb apartment listing in the Park Slope area of Brooklyn exceeded our expectations. We booked the 4 bedroom/3 bath apartments for our family of 5 adults, 1 teenager & 3 month old baby. Immaculately clean is an understatement. Plenty of room and space - kitchen, dining area, large bathrooms, closets - every room was equipped with all the amenities.  This apartment and location was perfect for the 6 nights & 7 days of our visit to attend my son's wedding in Brooklyn. We were within walking distance to the wedding venue, subways, a plethora of amazing restaurants & coffee shops, stores, laundry & so much more. The perfect neighborhood lined with trees, courtyards, and gardens. Perfect! Thank you Brenda, & family.[QWERTY123]Val, le mari de Brenda, nous a très bien accueilli, malgré une arrivée tardive à une heure du matin. Il est aimable, chaleureux et serviable. La location de la maison entière est idéale pour plusieurs couples (famille de 7 personnes dont 3 couples). Tout est vraiment propre. Quartier sympa, les commerces, resto et stations de métro sont accessibles à pied. Manhattan n'est qu'à 20 minutes de métro (Lignes F ou G).[QWERTY123]It was a super spot in the hart of Brooklyn! The owners were most kind and there hospitality was great![QWERTY123]We were greeted by Brandon but never met Brenda. Brandon was very helpful with information about the neighborhood and with luggage. We enjoyed our stay tremendously. The apartment was very clean and fairly spacious for our needs.[QWERTY123]We rented the entire 4 bedroom unit and were very pleased.  Brandon was very helpful getting us checked-in and was available if we needed him during our stay.  He let us keep our suitcases in his unit for a couple of hours after we checked out.  The unit is clean and comfortable.  The furnishings are not fancy, which was fine with us since we had young children.  The beds were comfortable for us and there is plenty of closet space.  We ate breakfast and occasional lunches here during our week stay.  Trying to cook dinner for all 9 of us might have been difficult, but we never did that.  As others have said, the neighborhood has everything you need and is very convenient.  We only used the subway once to go into Manhattan, but it is close.  We generally stayed in Brooklyn because this was a family wedding trip, but did occasionally use Uber or a car service to get around which is also easy. There are no hairdryers, so if that is important to you, you'll have to bring your own.  The wi-fi was very quick.  We'd be very happy to stay here again - perhaps in one of the studio units - if my husband and I come back to visit.[QWERTY123]Wonderful airbnb experience in Brooklyn!  We were a large group in town for a wedding and this flat was perfect.  Very clean, large, everything you need, lovely neighborhood.  Nothing but good things to say.  Thank you, Brenda.
[QWERTY123]Réactivité de Brenda lors de notre demande de réservation et réponses rapides à nos questions par mail et bon accueil de Brandon son fils à notre arrivée pour nous expliquer comment trouver les lignes de métro, et les différents commerces. 
Nous avons apprécié le quartier de l'appartement : familial, la proximité pour faire les courses et dîner au soir, la proximité des lignes de métro surtout la F qui nous menait directement à Manhattan. L'appartement correspondait bien à la description du site AIRBNB, place nécessaire pour nous accueillir tous les 8 (4 adultes et 4 adolescents), très propre.[QWERTY123]The reservation was canceled 87 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.[QWERTY123]Everything was great! Everything was clean. We had a lot of space. It was in a very nice neighbourhood. The owner was really nice. I have no complaints at all. Highly recommended.[QWERTY123]La mia esperienza è stata fantastica. Ci ha accolti il figlio di Brenda anche se eravamo oltre orario check-in infatti siamo arrivati intorno alle ore 21. La casa era descritta perfettamente e infatti abbiamo solo verificato le comodità e tutti i comfort di cui era dotata, essendo in otto avevamo ognuno i suoi spazi e anche la possibilità di trovarci per stare insieme. Era pulita ed fornita di asciugamani frigo e microonde in ogni camera e inoltre avevamo delle bottiglie d'acqua che ci erano necessarie essendo arrivati ad una certa ora e non conoscendo il luogo....c'era anche un phon asciugacapelli (avevo letto nelle recensioni che non c'era) e anche una lavastoviglie perfettamente funzionante, inoltre ogni stanza era dotata di aria condizionata o anche ventola a soffitto.
Il quartiere era residenziale e molto tranquillo, nelle avenue vicine c'erano bar, paninoteche e supermercati era quindi servitissimo e non lontano da due fermate metropolitante la F e la R che portano direttamente in centro Manhatann. Quindi piu che bene!!!![QWERTY123]The host canceled this reservation 80 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.[QWERTY123]Brenda and her son Brandon made us feel very welcome in their two story duplex apartment in a quiet street near the main avenue of Park Slope in Brooklyn. The place was very clean and comfortable and accommodated 7 of use very well. It is a short walk to the subway station, supermarket, delis and places to eat and drink.[QWERTY123]The listing description was accurate.  We were 9 people and felt comfortable in the duplex.  The apartment contained all the things one could want for an enjoyable stay,  was pleasant and very clean.  The neighborhood-Park Slope-is a super neighborhood, voted best neighborhood to live in by New York Magazine several times. I didn't actually meet Brenda but met her husband, a very nice fellow.  Her son Brandon dealt with the keys and administrative business, which was done professionally. 

I would definitely come back and would highly recommend this place to people visiting NYC.[QWERTY123]Great house with very nice person. We had problems with our luggage And Brenda and her son Brendon helped us. thank you[QWERTY123]This was an ideal stay.  The location was great, and the house was roomy and clean.[QWERTY123]The apartment was clean and beautiful as described, everything was available to enjoy our stay in NY. We had a warm welcome from Brenda's son Brandon who assisted us in case of queries. 
The apartment is located in a nice and quiet part of Brooklyn, close to restaurants, shops, supermarkets and a park.
A comfortable return to spend the evening and night  after a hectic day in Manhattan :-)[QWERTY123]It has been a wonderful experience in this accomodation. Very clean, very comfortable and a nice location in this friendly atmosphere. Val has been very polite and outgoing. We recommend completely this apartment.[QWERTY123]El lugar es mucho mejor de lo que suponiamos. Muchas comodidades.

Son 3 departamentos, entran 3 personas en dos de ellos y dos en otro. Uno es elibre más grande que tiene las cosas principales como heladera, cocina y microondas. Los demás tienen cada uno una cama matrimonial y dos tienen además una individual.  Muy cómodas.  

Cada espacio tiene baño. Muy completo y prolijo.  Las duchas funcionan a la perfección. Muchas toallas. 

La recepción fue en tiempo y forma. Nos prepararon un mapa con puntos claves de los alrededores. 

Hay Mas de un juego de llave por departamento. Cada uno de los deptos tienen tele y cable. La conexión WiFi es buena.  

El departamento principal tiene una mesa donde entran 8 personas.

En síntesis el lugar es genial, vale cada centavo y es fácil ir a Manhattan en metro.[QWERTY123]El duplex de Brenda ha cubierto nuestras espectativas para un grupo de 8 personas: limpio, con suficientes toallas para todos, wifi q funcionaba perfectamente. Las habitaciones triples tenían pequeña nevera, y tetera eléctrica. En una zona tranquila y a 10 minutos del metro. Muy recomendable[QWERTY123]When we arrived late at night, Brenda's husband Val greeted us and made us feel very welcome. We stayed 8 people for five days and couldn’t have found a better place to stay. The Park Slope area is so nice and feels very safe. The nearest subway has great connection to Manhattan. We rented both floors and the apartment is extremely clean and spacious with three bathrooms which was great for five adults and 3 teenagers. We would definitely stay here again and can totally recommend this apartment![QWERTY123]Brenda's son, Brandon, met me at the agreed time (the owners live on the first floor of the building) and showed me around. Everything was pretty straight forward, so there was not a ton to explain. There were plenty of towels, clean sheets on the bed, and even some bottled water in the fridge. Plenty of glasses, silverware, bottle openers, glasses, etc.. iron and ironing board provided too. 

We rented our the entire second and third floor of the brownstone. The third floor is the main space that has two bedrooms (sleeps 3 total), living room, kitchen, and one bathroom. This is the space we spent most of the time in as a group of six. However, we also had two additional separate rooms on the second floor. Each one is like a small studio apt with its own bathroom, fridge, kettle, etc.. This was great to give people more privacy and space (everyone had their own bed), while still having everyone staying together. We were very comfortable as a group of six there. We could have even fit 2-3 more people, if people were willing to share beds, but it may have been a little tight. 

Great place and I would definitely recommend it. Takes about 30 mins by car to  east village /downtown Manhattan and a bit longer by subway. Quite, pleasant street. Close to restaurants and cafes and also prospect park![QWERTY123]Our stay at Brenda's was wonderful. We were there for my sister's wedding so there were 8 of us staying together. Everyone had their own space and bathroom but could come together in the common space to celebrate and enjoy each other. The neighborhood was nice and very safe. Brenda and her son were extremely helpful and responsive. It was perfect and provided us with an amazing Brooklyn experience![QWERTY123]
It was a great experience--location perfect, everything was great. Napkins, salt and pepper, coffee filters, everything. We were there with family for daughter's wedding and this worked perfectly. Highly recommend.[QWERTY123]The host canceled this reservation 204 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.[QWERTY123]
Brenda and family made us very welcome and very happy to leave us to our own devices. Great space for a family get together , very relaxed atmosphere within the really vibrant Brooklyn Park Slope environment. Local shops and restaurants all great - special mention tho' to Thai restaurant on 5th for lovely food in, for once,  peaceful surrounds.[QWERTY123]Vi var 8 personer som hade en riktigt bra vecka i Brendas lägenhet. Läget är suveränt och lägenheten väl utrustad och fungerade väldigt bra för oss. Stora fina sovrum, bra kök och perfekt med 3 badrum. Brenda med familj svarade snabbt på de frågor vi hade innan ankomst och allt fungerade utmärkt kring in och utcheckning.[QWERTY123]Все супер. Местоположение супер. Квартира просторная т все необходимое там есть.[QWERTY123]We had a great stay in Brenda's place. Her son met us at the apartment on our arrival and showed us around. Everything was as pictured / described on the listing.

The location is really nice. The apartment is on a quiet street blocks from many restaurants, bars, markets, playgrounds, etc. The subway is a 10-minute walk as well.

Great place to stay.[QWERTY123]Brenda and Val are gracious hosts.  Their house is wonderful, roomy and comfortable.  I love the neighborhood.  I can't wait to come back.[QWERTY123]a home away from home[QWERTY123]Best location for visiting both Brooklyn and Manhattan!  Comfortable, not showy.  Family loved it![QWERTY123]Brenda was great to communicate with.  The house is spacious, clean and in a great location for subways and local amenities.  We rented the two floors as we were a family group but the rooms are available separately.  There are plenty of towels, cooking utensils etc. We all liked the house and I would recommend it for family groups to stay.[QWERTY123]We found Brenda's place to be very clean, the beds were comfortable and it had everything we needed.  Brenda was very accommodating and let us check in early as she didn't have anyone checking out that day.  She answered all of my inquiries in a timely manner.  I would definitely stay there again.

Carla[QWERTY123]Brenda's place was fantastic. Perfect location for where we were looking, great space - clean and comfortable beds and living spaces. It couldn't have worked out any better! Her son Brandon was super helpful, and both of them were always quick to respond to messages. Thanks Brenda![QWERTY123]My family and I really enjoyed our stay at Brenda's place.  It is on a beautiful street and the park nearby is a true gem if you have kids. There is also easy access to subways and yummy restaurants.[QWERTY123]Great duplex, clean and well equipped.
We really loved Park Slope neighbourhood[QWERTY123]Great place![QWERTY123]If you are looking for a GREAT place to stay in Park Slope.  Consider Brenda's air BnB.  Her son Brandon helped with all the details.  It is very convenient.  If you are a large party you will ALL be comfortable.[QWERTY123]Brenda’s place is immaculate , very roomy , fun large common area , in a quiet , convenient neighborhood . Highly recommend !!![QWERTY123]The host canceled this reservation 2 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.[QWERTY123]We enjoyed the stay, it's a bit in the expensive side of the budget. There is no shampoo and soap for showers-make sure that you bring it. Place is very spacious and has big rooms-we enjoyed the space. Other than the hard pillow we don't have any other complaints :)[QWERTY123]Brenda's place was excellent for our family. The rooms were spacious, the cleanliness was exemplary, and the comfort was awesome. Having an attached bath for each sleeping area was awesome. Her son, Brian was very welcoming and friendly. The location was perfect for us, close to restaurants and subway. We would stay here again anytime. A wonderful experience.[QWERTY123]It feels a little bit cold in winter.[QWERTY123]Brenda’s place was exceptional! It was clean, convenient, spacious, and wonderful! We appreciated the extra towels and thoughtful touches! Brenda is very responsive and we will definitely be back! I highly recommend Brenda’s place![QWERTY123]Excellent location with easily accessible amenities! It's also quite spacious which I did not expect - much better than several hotels that I've tried in the area. The hosts were also very accommodating with a late check-in due to travel issues.[QWERTY123]Great place, very clean, very spacious, convenient to everything.  House is great for a group.  Kitchen is good, and there is a Whole Foods within walking distance for shopping.  Only one minor complaint: the bath towels are kind of small ...[QWERTY123]Good location, nice and quiet neighborhood.  Close to many Prospect Park and some nice coffee shops and breakfast places.  Good apartment and very easy to get in and out.  Great communication.[QWERTY123]This is a great set up for three couples or even three small families. Each of the larger bedrooms have their own bathroom with the small single room sharing a bathroom. The kitchen has everything you need to cook any kind of meals. There is plenty of light and space. The living room couches seat 5 but the dining room chairs are right there if you have more people. The brownstone is well located between streets with restaurants and the park. The place is super clean and efficient - not a charming brownstone, i.e. no wonderful woodwork and mouldings - but otherwise a good deal. Brenda and her son were very responsive.[QWERTY123]This was the fourth AirBnB apartment I've rented in NY in the past 6 years and this was unquestionably the best, especially for families and larger groups. The pictures and description are precise. One fantastic plus is the air-conditioning: temperatures recently reached 93F/35C and the humidity was high!  Before moving abroad I lived 25 years in NY, the last years in Park Slope, so air-conditioning is a blessing, especially in July and August. Brandon met us on arrival and let us store our bags on leaving. He is very helpful and communicative.  If you need a place to stay in a quiet location with all amenities close to wonderful places like Prospect Park, the Botanic Gardens and the Brooklyn Museum, you can't beat this. Excellent bus service to downtown Brooklyn and subway connections to all parts of town. No shortage of bars, restaurants and foodstores.[QWERTY123]Brenda and her son Brandon were great communicators.  The apartments slept my family of 8 in four separate bedrooms.  Everyone was comfortable.  Great family room for hanging out. The location was perfect for getting around Brooklyn and into Manhattan.  Loved the farmer's market down the street (half a block away)  Great bagels on the corner with grocery and other stores around the corner.  Very helpful in letting us leave our bags while we toured for another day before catching our plane.  Always helpful.[QWERTY123]This apartment is located in a great neighborhood that is a perfect balance between quiet and fun. There are tons of casual restaurant and bars a couple of mins away. 

Great location for people who want to visit the city as the different subway lines can get you in different parts of Manhattan fairly quickly

The place is quiet and clean with a very big number of sleeping options. Perfect for families.[QWERTY123]We had a great stay at Brenda's apartment. The location is fantastic and having the space to spread out was great. It was clean, large and ideal! We loved it and would stay again.[QWERTY123]This was a great place to stay! Clean home, friendly neighbors, and so many things to do within blocks![QWERTY123]very clean and located in a nice part of brooklyn[QWERTY123]Fantastic location, close to the subway, parks and local restaurants and stores-beautiful apartment with lots of room.  Convenient check-in/check-out and hosts are wonderful.  Perfect many different sized groups.[QWERTY123]Beaucoup d'atouts pour ce logement à Brooklyn: localisation dans un quartier charmant et commerçant; grandes chambres et 3 salles de bains; accueil personnalisé agréable;  stations de metro à moins de 15 mn. Nous recommandons avec plaisir ce logement pour une grande famille ou un groupe de voyageurs.[QWERTY123]Brenda and her son Brandon provided an outstanding home for us to stay while we visited NYC for the first time. Situated in a charming part of Brooklyn, their duplex was the perfect space to relax after a long day of adventuring![QWERTY123]Brenda's place is a cute Brownstone in the perfect location in Brooklyn. The rooms were roomy and we had everything we needed. Brenda is easy to communicate with and very responsive. I'd definitely stay there again.[QWERTY123]Located in a very nice area in Brooklyn with multiple food options just down the street. The place was very clean and Brenda was very responsive and communicative, which made the Airbnb experience smooth and easy!![QWERTY123]Super geräumige Unterkunft mit guter Ausstattung. Einkaufsmöglichkeiten und öffentliche Verkehrsmittel in fussläufiger Entfernung. Gerne wieder..."	40.66940797980192	-73.98109085455074	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/24285	9	250.0	0.85
85	12192	"This place was awesome! The location was great, not too far from the subway and in the middle of all the action, great restaurants and bars on every block! Ed and his roommate Dennis were awesome as well, super nice and helpful!  I'd definitely come back to the city and stay with them again![QWERTY123]It's a convenient location, a couple of  blocks from the metro, and Edward is lovely. :) Room is simple but enough, proper bed, and a small window. However, it may not be 100 % comfortable for a girl travelling alone, in terms of bathroom cleanliness or the neighbourhood.. other than that, it's a good stay for that price. comparable to the better hostels in town.[QWERTY123]Good spot in my favourite part of town. 

Will definitely go back & stay again when I come back to New York.[QWERTY123]really good spot and really good guy!!! 
good communication, excellent availability and optimum price... therefore, awsome!!![QWERTY123]I really appreciated having an inexpensive place to stay in Manhattan.  Edward did a good job communicating and I had no trouble finding it, getting in, etc, even though I wound up never meeting him.  The building is a little sketch, the place is not particularly clean, but for $40, totally worth it and it's great having some private space to leave your stuff.  Thanks![QWERTY123]Ed is just a fantastic guy ! Very accommodating, easy going and with great culture ! The spot is conveniently located, quiet neighborhood with a great burgerplace next door providing great tap beers and amazing milkshakes !!  
All this for a totally adequate price ! Thank you so much Ed.[QWERTY123]EDWARD - great guy and very helpful in answering any questions that we had.

PRICE - A great bargain!

LOCATION - Very conveniently located to the subway.

ROOM - Great for a short stay _ clean sheets, comfortable bed, and new cool lamp

BATHROOM - OK for a guy, cleanliness needs to improve for the ladies[QWERTY123]Edward is a gracious and helpful host. He made me feel welcome and he helped me get to the know the neighborhood. 

Regarding the apartment, it is fine for a short stay. 

Pros: The building and apartment are very secure, and I was given a key for the apartment, room, and building. 

Cons: It is a basement apartment with a tiny window, so it has a cellar-type feel so the room is best for active travelers who plan to spend their free time exploring the city. 

Regarding cleanliness, I would describe the apartment as slightly weathered, but definitely not dirty or unclean. I wouldn't bring a date to the room, but there really is nothing that should discourage female travelers from this place. 

If you are on business or on vacation I would get a more expensive room but if you are a traveler you will be getting a great value for a secure and private place to sleep.[QWERTY123]Affordable and conveniently located near the subway. We just met Edward once (the late night of our arrival in NY) and he was helpful and nice. The bed was comfortable and the bathroom kind of tiny and obviously run by males...But we didn't spend much time in there, so who cares...Great neighborhood, quiet street...We only regret the fact that we couldn't taste a good ramen soup at the Minca Ramen Factory (next door), but we'll do it at one point, that's for sure![QWERTY123]To tell the truth - it was  our worst stay ever!

The room's locate in the basement (that was not explained in Edward's descriprion and we were struck on coming there after arriving in NY).
A dusty room of a closet size with a tiny window, through wich one can enjoy an unforgettable landscape of stinky trash cans. Don't believe the view of  Manhattan in one of the pics in the room's description. It's fake.

We made a grave mistake when having booked the room for our entire NY vacation (2 weeks). We could hardly spend there a couple of days - in that stuffy room with bed sheets that seemed not to have been cleaned ever.
The last drop was when Masha got an allergy attack and became covered with rash (though no cases of such strengh had take place earlier).

Se, we were forced to move ASAP.

BUT!! Attention - we lost approximately 300$ on it. The AIRBNB compensated only 50 % of the total sum for the rest days with Edward's(yeah, you won't believe!) and detained their fees. We had to urgently find another place through BNB and pay their fee again (is that fair?).

So, please, be careful with this choice!

P.S.On leaving Edward, we stayed at another place - for the same price - it was excellent![QWERTY123]we had a great time in NYC
we had lots planed and we were gone out for most of the time, so the apartment was only used for sleeping.. for us, that was fine. the cleanliness could be improoved. you get what you pay for...
Edward is a nice and helpful guy.[QWERTY123]We had a fantastic stay at Edward's place. Room was very simple and was all we needed. What made our trip best was Edward and they way he was able to make our stay so amazing. Thanks for showing us all the cool places in NY and making our stay so comfortable. Anyone staying at Edward's must go to the roof top for the amazing view of NY.  Such a great location too. So easy to get anywhere from East village.  Make sure to go to the amazing Two Boots pizza place just a block away.[QWERTY123]i've stayed in Edwards home for 7 days, and i've been very good... Edward is a very nice guy, very easy.
the room is confortable and is areally good price.the location, is alfabet city, is very interesting!!![QWERTY123]I stayed in Edwards place for three days and had a great time. A simple room, but suitable for my needs and at an optimum price. Edward is a really nice guy, hospitable and easy-going. On top, the location is prime, right in the middle of my favorite part of the city.[QWERTY123]The place was great, excellent location.  Everything that I needed.[QWERTY123]Small, but clean and convenient basement apartment. Comfy bed, friendly and attentive host. I had an excellent stay here, much nicer than the YMCA at less than half the price!

Nicky Hamlyn.[QWERTY123]I had a nice experience staying at Edward's apartment. The room is just as advertised, small and clean, and in an a superb location. Also, it is surprisingly quite considering all the nightlife around.[QWERTY123]I spent 33 days at Edward's place and I thank him for making his home available.  

The room was clean and adequate for what I needed, somewhere to sleep, write my notes and make my water colour sketches and other mini artworks (and the bathroom and kitchen were always available also) ---.  

East Village is an excellent location to get the feel of New York with Edward's place in the Village being central to other areas of interest in New York for me.

Once I got my ""New York Feet"" I found it very easy to move around Manhattan from Edward's on foot and then I graduated to riding on the Great New York Subways with stations close by Edward's place ---.

Edward is a genuinly delightful humanist, he was very helpful with any questioins I had and I wish him every success in his career as stage actor.

Thank you Edawrd for the discussions we had (often into the early hours of the morning) I consider you a friend and who knows maybe in year or so I'll be back ---.

I have no hessitaion in recommending staying at Edwrad's place and in closing Edward has a saying ""Enjoy"".  I did - and you will.

Four Stars.

David T from Down Under.    

[QWERTY123]Room and furnishings were as described.  We had a great time staying with Edward.  Location is convenient and everything we needed was provided.  It was great to be able to have access to a kitchen/dining area. 
Highly recommended, especially for those travelers just looking for a base of operations.[QWERTY123]Ed's place was a great hideaway in the East Village. Amazing location in the thick of it. My stay was a really quick one night stopover so I didn't get to meet Ed, but his apartment was nice and clean and hospitable. Highly recommended. 
[QWERTY123]Edward is a very good host. He allowed us to check out late and helped us a lot during our stay there. His place is cool, everything is there. Even though it's quite hot down there you can always steal his portable fan ! :)[QWERTY123]This apartment was really the bad side of our trip in NY, we advise you against it at all costs. 

When we arrived, we saw the real lack of windows (in fact the apartment is in a kind of basement), and it was not really clean, overall the bathroom.  But the room seemed to be clean (sheets and towels clean).
It was ok for us, because we only stayed there for sleeping. 

After a few days, we saw cockroaches in the bathroom, there were more and more until we left.

The worst arrived when I discovered mouse's droppings in our room. After a few days, we saw the mouse in the kitchen, and the last night was really terrible : we didn't sleep at all, hearing the mouse walking in our room, and saw it on our bags...

Edward was in holidays and wasn't there during our 10 days in NY, but was available by email, and was really nice... but that didn't solve anything, the apartment was dirty and we wanted to stay there the less time possible.[QWERTY123]Edward and his place are exactly what you're looking for in NYC. That is if you want a communal, clean and simple crash pad, an outgoing and gracious host who is will make sure you find everything you need, and piles of interesting eye and mind candy (and food, drinks, bodegas) within walking distance.[QWERTY123]Edward is a really nice guy and very flexible regarding time. We arrived at a time Edward was working, so he couldn't be there to give us the key, but he arranged for us to pick up the key upstairs so we could drop off our stuff. Checking out was easy as well; we could leave our stuff at his place untill we actually left New York.
The room is perfect for when you're staying for a couple of days and just need a place to sleep. The bathroom really reflects it being in a basement (pipe running through the room, a bit rusty and I saw some small bugs), but this was no problem for us. Oh and the towels we're nice and soft! :D[QWERTY123]Ed is a great guy - the room is very modest but serviceable.  It also has a lock and key, so you can leave your stuff there.  Keep in mmind that these buildings are rather dated, so this is a basic living arrangement.  The area is really quite cool and has a funky vibe to it - lots of cool cafes and coffee shoppes, lots of young folks with a great chill attitude.[QWERTY123]My partner and I have stayed with Edward twice now. He's a great host, his cat a serious bonus, the space is clean, and the neighborhood is alive! For the price, this accommodation can't be beat![QWERTY123]Edouard offre une chambre pas chère pour une ville telle que NY en plein East Village. La chambre est correcte et propre. Edouard a été disponible et toujours prêt à nous aider durant notre voyage.

[QWERTY123]The place is very great and Edward is a very great guy as well. It is a very friendly, nice environment. I was definitely lucky to have stayed here. 
[QWERTY123]Edward was an amazing host who is knowledgeable and friendly - the room is perfect if you need a place to crash and is close to so many great bars, cafes and restaurants.  I would stay there again anytime![QWERTY123]Edward's apartment is perfectly located in the East Village, close to just about everything I wanted to do and everywhere I wanted to go. The apartment itself is a small basement unit that gets very little light. But that wasn't an issue since I was barely there during my three nights stay. It was the ideal place for me to drop my stuff off, go out, come back to for sleeping and showering. 

I met Edward for a brief time. He was really nice and courteous, much like his cat Joshua, who was very friendly and playful. 

All in all, a good and comfortable experience.[QWERTY123]Great location and price, Edwards' a champ and I highly recommend it as an alternative to hostels or more expensive options.  I had a bit of work to do and it was quiet and peaceful there as well.

Cheers Edward![QWERTY123]Edward was extremely accommodating, left his keys at the restaurant downstairs so I wouldn't have to drag my luggage around until he was off work.  His cat is adorable by the way.  Would definitely recommend staying there![QWERTY123]Ed is a great host and a very open-minded person. I stayed six nights there - the room is small but the price is awesome when you consider that you are in the middle of crazy hopping East Village!
Klaus - Denmar[QWERTY123]I had a great time in NY staying with Edward. Edward, his girlfriend and Dennis (the guy living next to me) are nice and helping people. They know the neighborhood and all the good places to go and they're happy to share. So if you're a tourist like me, ask them where to go and what to see.[QWERTY123]Definitely a place for 'backpackers'. A bargain for NYC! Excellent location, near to the coolest places of the East Village and easy to get in and out by Subway & Bus. 

Edward is a very nice person, respectful, easy-going and ready to answer your questions.  The room is fine, very comfortable bed and we even found there a very interesting guide for New York that we used a lot. 

The only DOWNSIDE of the place are the bath and kitchen amenities that you share, which are not always in the best conditions. Since it's a basement and there's lots of humidity, you may find bugs or moisture in both. So be warned if you can't stand bugs or small insects (roaches)... you could be surprised when going to pee at night. If you are OK with this GO ahead and book![QWERTY123]The bed was good and Edward is a very nice host.[QWERTY123]Price/quality is good. We recomment this place.
We have had a very nice and pleasant week at Edward's place. He and  his girlfriend are very nice people. The room was small and dark, but then again, we were not in NY to stay in the room all the time. We enjoyed the wifi and the tv in the room. 
The only remakrs are that the apartment is very dark and could be a little cleaner.
The neighborhood is very nice with lots of nice bars, restaurants and deli's. It is about 10 minutes walk from the subway to the apartment.
Edward, thanks for a nice week![QWERTY123]Ed's place is great for the cost. It's a sweet location and I never had any trouble getting back to it. It's smaller, but I'd have to describe it more ""cozy"" than I would ""cramped."" Everything was in good order and there were even magazines and cool guide books to seeing the city. I dug it. 

As for the host himself, Ed was great. He wasn't intrusive nor was he elusive. Very kind and helpful with suggestions of things to do.  Down to Earth friendly guy. I'm glad it worked out so well. This was my first time ever using Airbnb and I had no idea what to expect. I can only hope that all my future trips work out like this one![QWERTY123]Edward was a wonderful host ! 
The room is great, private and all. Ask anything to Edward, he knows a lot of stuff about the city, what to do, you can find guides in the room, etc etc. So great !
The bathroom is a little bit small, but overall it's still a great !
The appartment is in a basement, you have to go through a backyard/garbage hall to get in, but once you're there it's OK. Located in a vibrant neighborhood of the city, very nice to wander in !
The basement location can feel cramped or such to some people, but really, if you come to visit NyC, you don't want to stay in your room all the time ;-)
Overall, a bargain for the location, a real great value, and Joshua (the cat) is so cuute and friendly !
Highly recommended for a good quality/price ratio !

[QWERTY123]Great room and apartment, and Edward is a very thoughtful, helpful and friendly host.  Location is pretty good, too (near pleasant restaurants, several minutes walk from a subway stop).  The only problem is outside of the apartment:  the courtyard and hallways you have to walk through to get to Edward's place are full of loose garbage.[QWERTY123]We enjoyed our stay by Edward's. First experience with airbnb and definitely not the last!
Edward is a friendly and helpful host. The appartment is in a basement, the room quite small but very clean and comfortable! The location is perfect to enjoy NYC especially by night. The price is amazing for travellers with low budget![QWERTY123]Edward's place is in a fabulous part of the city!  The price was a steal for a place in Manhattan.  The sheets were clean and the atmosphere quiet and chill.  Edward is very easy to get in contact with, super friendly and a great host.  He offers up everything - towels, NYC books, kitchen, fridge, tea, house keys - that you need to make your trip comfortable.
Although the room is clean, the guest bedroom's window is ground-level on a garbage-filled alley, so if the window/fan is left open, the smell in the room will reflect what is going on outside - one evening we could smell vomit (however, the next day no problems). To avoid this, keep the window closed if it's not hot.[QWERTY123]I had a really great time at Edward's place, him and Kara were amazing and we got along pretty well. They are amazing people and I felt so comfortable in the house because even if it isn't big it felt cozy and cool for me.
I would definitely keep in touch with both of them and I really hope to see them in the near future.[QWERTY123]Edward a été accueillant disponible lorsque nous en avions besoin. 
L'appartement est bien situé à East Village, le point négatif est qu'il se situe en demi-sous-sol et qu'il est donc sombre.[QWERTY123]Good and cheap location to visit Manahattan.[QWERTY123]Hey! Was really great meeting the guys, very nice to stay over, the area is great. Definitely a place to stay!!

Thanks Edward!!
[QWERTY123]Edward is an awesome guy, I only met him briefly as he was going to Cali but he was always generous helpful and welcoming on every occasion we met. His room mate Denis is lovely aswell, always happy to stop and have a chat. The room and apartment are exactly like they are in the photos on the website. Perfect for me, in a great location, close to a lot of little deli shops and a laundrette. The East Village comedy club is just around the corner and the view from the room alone is enough to take this apartment. I stayed here for a month and loved every min of it. No complaints at all.[QWERTY123]We had a good time with Edward and his (Hidden by Airbnb) who were really friendly, laid-back and helpful. The room is pretty basic and doesn't get much natural light but it's comfortable, clean and fairly quiet - perfect if you just need a bed and an internet connection. The location is fantastic and overall it's a really good value place to stay[QWERTY123]Preis und Leistung sind angemessen
allerdings sollte man mit seiner Partnerin nicht unbedingt  dort übernachten da es doch sehr einfach ist.Wer ansprüche hat sollte woanders buchen. Der Gastgeber war nett  und man kann in 30 minuten den Timesquare erreichen . 
Es war sauber allerdings gab es im Bad kleine Mitbewohner (Ka....)[QWERTY123]I always love staying in the Lower East Side. It's close to some of my favorite eateries.  Ed's place is simple and no frills but you get a private room with a queen bed in a great location.  What more can you ask for? I would definitely stay there again.[QWERTY123]Great room! The location is awesome, walking distance to everything great downtown, on a quiet street. Edward and Kara are extremely nice and helpful, and their cats are so sweet! Tidy place, small kitchen area to share, can get a bit hot at times with the water pipes but crank up the fan and you'll be fine. I definitely recommend it and would stay there again. Thanks![QWERTY123]Great place and awesome hosts! Perfect location, close to everything in the EV and very accessible. The room was clean and comfortable and all the basic necessities were covered. Fun loving cats with great personalities too, very entertaining. We really enjoyed our stay and will definitely be back.[QWERTY123]Myself and my gf stayed over the first week of december.

Good points:

The shower worked with hot water and the bed was comfortable, Edward and his room mate were really friendly and helpful.
Location is great with many resturants and bars nearby that do happy hours, half the price of midtown. Tube is 10 mins walk away which wasn't too bad. 

Negatives:

Room temperature was up and down, some nights it was cold, other nights very hot.
For two people (who did quite alot of shopping) we struggled for space in the room however I would see it as perfect for a lone traveller or for people with not alot of stuff.

If you don't like cats then I would not recommend staying there, you cannot avoid the litter tray and the friendly inqusitive cats![QWERTY123]Edouard et Kara ont été formidable tous les deux. Extrêmement arrangeant puisqu'ils nous ont hébergés chez eux dans leur nouvel appartement pour une nuit.

L'appartement est idéalement situé (East Village) et permet l'accès à pied aux incontournable de Manhattan. 

Seul bémol (que de l'eau chaude dans la baignoire :)[QWERTY123]It was a small room in the basement, not that much daylight but very peaceful and quiet. The temperature was either very hot or chilly. Still very   affordable and Edward was always nice and helpful when we needed help.[QWERTY123]Edward has been very nice, reliable and helpful with recommendations on where to eat and what to do in NYC. The room is clean and very functional. There was enough space for my luggage, a very comfortable bed and everything I needed, even a TV. The bathroom has a good shower with constant hot water. The best thing about the apartment is its location. It's located in the east village, a nice and vibrant neighborhood, close to sweet shops, plenty of restaurants, NYU, subway stations... I can totally recommend staying there if you look for an inexpensive place to sleep and relax in Manhattan.[QWERTY123]Definitely the genuine NYC experience here!
This is the perfect place for those looking for convenient, inexpensive & no-fuss accommodation. Edward was a gracious host, quick to respond to any queries I had & only too happy to play guide & share information to a traveller.
Would try to book again when I return, such a unique vibe![QWERTY123]What an odd little place.  It's exactly as described - a very small place buried in the basement at the back of a larger apartment building. Apparently there are lots of apartments in NYC just like this, so you'll really get a feel of what it's like to be a typical New Yorker that doesn't work on Wall St.  It's a great place to crash, but don't expect to get too comfortable (who wants to stay inside when you're in NYC, anyway?).  The bed was a bit on the firm side, and my girlfriend ended up buying a small mat to take the edge off and it was fine.  One thing to be aware of: sometimes the heat in the building is turned on, and since the main line radiator pipes pass through the apartment, it can get really hot in there really fast.  We walked in from 50 degrees and raining to a dry 90 degrees inside the apartment!  Once we got the fan and the window unit rolling, it became comfortable enough, so it wasn't any big deal.  Overall the place is super functional, not fancy, and perfectly located close to just about everything.

Edward was a gracious host, and gave us a few tips of where to go and where to catch some good food in the neighborhood.  

I'd recommend this place to anyone who is looking to spend most of their  time exploring the city, isn't too concerned with creature comforts, and doesn't want to spend a lot of money.  Thanks, Edward![QWERTY123]Edward was such a great host! The place is exactly as it looked, and Edward was really accommodating about letting me check in and out when it was convenient to my friend and me. I would definitely stay here again -- you can't beat the price or the location.[QWERTY123]Semaine très agréable. 
Nous n'avons croisé Edward qu'une fois (très sympathique) mais il était très disponible par mail, par téléphone.
Bon emplacement de l'appart et bon rapport qualité/prix.[QWERTY123]Hosts Kara and Edward were super lovely and happy to help. The room is rather small..well, for someone like me who had 2 big suitcases, a carry on and a big bag. For someone who wanted a room and a fairly big bed with a bit of room, no problem. It wasn't really a problem for me either. I'm pretty easy when it comes to things like this. It was just a bed for me to sleep in really. Big clean bed. Comfy. No natural light in room though. I didn't spend much time in there as i was too busy seeing NYC. Bathroom was small but do-able. I'm only little. I'd say the place was quite clean. I caught Edward cleaning out the rooms once people had left to change the sheets, etc and clean the kitchen and bathroom and vaccum, so i was pleased. There were however a few cockroaches which have seen roaming around in the room and bathroom. No biggie though. The room has some hangers for your clothes if you need them. I didn't use them. There is a tv and a dvd player which i didn't use either. There is a small bedside table with a few drawers if you need it and there's a mirror too. It's not a hotel room so don't expect too much but is perfect for the simple traveller like myself who really just wanted a bed in a nice location. It's safe and it's near the corner of 5th St and Avenue A. There is a supermarket a block away and i always walked to 14th street to catch the L train to get to places. I thought the area was close to everything i needed. Kara was helpful when i arrived and waited until i got there as i got a little lost. Met some lovely people who lived in the room next to me too. This is my first time using airbnb so i didn't know what to expect, but i'll surely be using it again!

Only minusing points for the small room and cockroaches :) Though, i'm sure the small room part was already stated so that's my fault.

Thanks Ed and Kara![QWERTY123]We had a great stay here. The room is quaint but exactly what you need, and super peaceful for something in Manhattan! The area has a great vibe, with cafes, bars and restaurants all at close reach. The burger bar next door was quite possibly the best burger bar I went to whilst in NYC. 

Edward is super friendly, helpful and accommodating; and has some great stories to share of all the people that have stayed there.

Definitely recommend this for people looking for cheap and convenient.[QWERTY123]Very accommodating on short notice. Fast responses. Great place thank you[QWERTY123]The only good thing about this place is the location.[QWERTY123]My boyfriend and I stayed with Edward for two nights recently and we were both happy with the experience. The room was cool enough to sleep on two hot days in July, aided by the fact that it is a basement apartment and Edward’s fan set up. The towels and sheets were clean and seemed to have been purchased relatively recently and the common space was tidy. Edward was very nice, stopping to talk with us for a few minutes when we first go to the city and when we were on our way out. If he were in my city I would certainly meet up with him again. 
The only downside I can think of is that the tiny bathroom was not quite as clean as I could have preferred, but it was fine and had everything we needed. The room wasn’t big, but the bed was firm and comfortably slept the two of us. It was also nice that the door to the room locked, so we felt safe leaving our suitcases there while we were out. The location was the high point for sure, as we were easily able to walk through the majority of lower manhattan, catch the subway, and on our last day we got a cab to the airport in no time. 
I hope this is helpful to anyone considering staying with Edward. Have a good time![QWERTY123]I stayed here with my girlfriend for four nights. Edward was terrific and the room and apartment were exactly as described. Edward is more than accommodating with any of your needs and is a wonderful host. The apartment's location in the East Village is great. NYU, Washington Square Park and great East Village stores, restaurants and boutiques were all within walking distance. The Delancy St and 2nd Av subway stations are both close by. From there, you can reach almost anywhere in NYC in 30 minutes or less. While the apartment is not luxurious, you are close to just about anything you'd want to do in NYC. Also, Edward gave us great info on where to eat, how to get places and what things to do in the city. Highly recommend staying here for anyone planning to visit New York. The experience was great.[QWERTY123]Nous avons été accueillis par un ami d'Edward car celui-ci était parti faire du camping. Là, mauvaise surprise : le logement, que nous avions compris comme étant un rez-de-chaussée, était en fait une cave dans une cour pleine d'ordures, de poubelles, et de meubles usagés.
""L'appartement"" ne comportait aucune fenêtre, aucune aération, était vraiment d'une propreté douteuse, le frigo ne marchait pas...Le premier soir en faisant la cuisine, nous avons eu la désagréable surprise de rencontrer un cafard, puis deux, puis trois...Pareil dans la cour où ils pullullaient. Le deuxième soir, nous nous sommes aperçus qu'il y avait des puces dans la literie, donc nous sommes partis. Alors que nous avions payé pour cinq nuits.
Nous n'avons jamais rencontré Edward, qui nous a quand même envoyé un mail pour savoir s'il y avait un problème...
J'oublie : les rencontres avec les clochards du coin qui se lavent au jet dans la cour ou qui fouillent dans les poubelles quand vous sortez le matin. 
 Même si elle est éminemment bien placée dans NY (quoique l'East Village prenne des allures de cour des miracles en journée, avec des rassemblements de marginaux), peu chère, et pas loin des transports et d'une supérette, une adresse absolument à éviter donc, sauf si l'on est un routard très très très endurci.[QWERTY123]Edward was a great host! friendly and very relaxed. Our expierence there was great! the department is located in a really convenient place. Even though it doesn't seem too luxurious at first sight, it is very confortable and it has everything you need.[QWERTY123]Edward really made the most of this small basement apartment. He was very accommodating, and The place made for a nice stay.[QWERTY123]First of all, I put 3 stars to our stay, but I could have put 2 or 4 stars. Edward is a really kind person, he really takes care of his guests. But the apartment is not so good ! The appartment is really dark, there are few cockroaches, the bathroom is quite old and not so perfectly clean! BUT, the apartment has a great location and for this price you can't find any hotel in NYC. For students, it's a quite good location ![QWERTY123]My brother and I stayed in NYC for one week and we were really happy with the apartment. It's located right in the middl of East Village which is a very good place for people who love bars, pubs and restaurants. Also, it's just a 5 min walk away from the subway station, so you can go anywhere in no time.
Edward was very helpful with giving us directions, especially when I first called him at the airport. We met up twice, so he told us some more things about where to go and what to do.
Altogether, I really recommend this apartment.[QWERTY123]We stayed with Edward for 2 weeks and we had a great experience. The room and apartment provides you with all the basic things you need in NYC. The apartment is located in the basement of a very popular part of town where there are always things to do and is close to the tourist shopping and sightseeing areas. Edward gave us tips about where to go and provided us with a subway map and tourist guide. Edward was a great host, we could reach him anytime if we had questions or needed some info about something. Overall, a great experience[QWERTY123]Edward was very friendly, helping carry our heavy bags down to the room & providing maps/ nyc guides. The east village is an awesome location, surrounded by quirky little restaurants & bars & fairly close to the subway. Our stay was affected by hurricane sandy & he was very quick with communication due to travel changes that occurred. The room was small but comfortable, bed linen & towels provided were nice.[QWERTY123]Edward and his girlfriend did everything to make our stay very welcome and enjoyable.
The apartment is very simple and we only used it to sleep and if you want it for that reason it's okay. It is not a place to spent much time, because it's dark and not too cosy. At night (in winter) it is very warm and there is not much daylight. The privacy is not high because we shared the kitchen and bathroom with another (by the way: a very friendly man) resident (which was not mentioned).
The place is clean en kept tidy good enough. The neighbourhood is friendly and nice, and there are some good cafes (the croissant cafe is excellent!) and coffeeshops and stores.
We recommend the place for those who want a very affordable place to sleep and shower and who do not want topquality or luxury.

Our experience is that we had a good host who gave us value for money and above all: who was friendly and generous.

Thanks Edward for the experience![QWERTY123]Edward was very cool about letting me and my friend check in earlier in the morning, having just jumped off an overnight redeye flight from LA.  Very easy going, gave me a quick rundown of things to enjoy the apartment and our stay.  We were not home often so I didn't really see Edward after but he made it clear that we can call him if we needed anything.  Great location!  And as his description said, he did have roommates and they were cool and friendly!  I'd definitely come back here again.[QWERTY123]Very good experience in the flat of Edward ! it was very nice to met him ! It's a very nice ""hote"" ![QWERTY123]Edward was a great host: good communication even before booking and throughout stay. And he is a very nice guy!
The room was exactly as pictured. It is very basic but had everything I needed.  I was going to be out enjoying the city and wanted a clean, safe place to shower, sleep, and charge my phone. I wasn't planning on hanging out in the apartment, so location and price were much more important to me than having a deluxe spa accommodation. The location is great: lots of good food within walking distance (even on the same block), supermarket 1 block away, post office nearby, deli on the corner. Easy access to the subway. The apartment does not get a lot of natural light and the tub is old so the undercoat shows through the porcelain even when it is scrubbed. For such a fabulous location at such a reasonable price that was fine with me. (as they say, "" Location, Cheap, Fancy: pick 2"") This would not be a place I would send my (conservative, suburban, corporate) parents to, but if you are young, hip, and on a budget this will put you in the middle of all the East Village/Alphabet city/ Lower East Side action. 
Edward is very honest, reliable and up front, so if you are not sure if this is for you, ask him your questions and he will give you a straight answer. For what I wanted (cheap, safe & awesome location) it was great![QWERTY123]Edward's place was perfectly located! That was the good point. Edward was also quite available for us. Some other points are not so good. The room is in a basement but the air is very bad, or you get so hot you can't sleep, or you get so cold that it wakes you up too! The bathroom was not easy to use. It was old but also dirty and lots of hairs left in the bath and in the sink... Quite disgusting, even the roaches were running out of the bathroom... You also had to go through the trashes backyard to get to the basement. Well, we could handle two nights, but more woud have been harder! You pay for the location, not for the place![QWERTY123]Great host. Nice and affordable room.[QWERTY123]The apartment was as described in the photos, the neighbourhood very quiet and safe, surrounded by lots of shops and bars. The room was very small, but it was enough to leave our cases and go out all day. The bed was great, very comfortable and soft sheets.. we could sleep with no issues. The kitchen had all what was neccesary, microwave, electric oven, fridge working perfectly. Dennis received us into the apartment and then we met Edward, both great guys who helped us everytime we needed.[QWERTY123]My best friend and I stayed in Edward's apartment for 5 nights. He has been very nice, reliable and helpful. The room is clean and very functional. There was enough space for our luggage, a very comfortable bed and everything we needed. The best thing about the apartment is its location. It's located in the east village, close to sweet shops, plenty of restaurants, subway stations... I can totally recommend staying there if you look for an inexpensive place to sleep in Manhattan.
[QWERTY123]Edward was very nice; the place was clean.  It is a basement flat. There were rodents in the basement courtyard.  There was a ""regular roomer"" Dennis who was very nice and helpful and two other people from Australia.  A very good  deal for the price.  The neighborhood is full of good value restaurants and  it is safe.  Enjoy![QWERTY123]Edward is a great host. Very helpful and accommodating. Location is perfect in a very safe neighbourhood. The apartment was exactly as described. Highly recommended![QWERTY123]Best thing about this appartment is the location!! Lots of restaurants and bars in the area and really nice atmosphere in the evening. The room was good for sleeping. Bathroom was quite wet as some water dropped on the floor despite of the shower curtain and the other guests didn't bother to dry the floor. Edward was really nice and helpful host.[QWERTY123]I had a very nice stay at Edward's place. He waited for me til late for my arrival, he is very nice, even if we didnt have the opportunity to talk more.
The bed is confy, there is the AC if it is too warm.
The place is exactly what you need for a week to visit NYC.
[QWERTY123]Edward is a great host and a really cool guy to talk with. The apartment is in a great neighborhood, close to public transportation, easy to get a cab, lots of food and bars/pubs. In fact when I got there, the bar next door had put ads in front of his apt for a first free microbrew... Sold! Great way to get things started. The room is not bad, very functional, has a tv if you want to watch it. Bathroom is small, but hello, this is NY, all living spaces are small. Edward's roommate Dennis was also a really cool guy to talk to. Overall, a great experience and I'd strongly recommend to any of my friends who are visiting the city.[QWERTY123]Edward was great. He worked with me to find a good check in time to accommodate both of our travel plans and was a really great guy to talk to, even though we never had the pleasure of meeting in person. He seems really nice. The apartment was in a fantastic location for the price - plenty to do nearby and easy to get to other parts of the city as well. The room is in a basement apartment = absolutely no natural light. It also seemed to be more humid inside the apartment than outside, which was surprising every single time I got back. However, there is a window ac unit in the kitchen that worked and successfully cooled the place down. The bathroom wasn't that clean, and you had to walk through the garbage courtyard thing to get to the front door. However, it was easy to look past all of this for the price/location. This room would be best for people who want a convenient, cheap location in Manhattan and only need a place to sleep and leave their belongings. Overall it was a fantastic choice for me.[QWERTY123]It was a very nice place to stay and comfortable as well, my friend and I liked the place, plus is very well located and more importantly, safe. Though we only see Edward once he is a very cool guy.[QWERTY123]We stayed at Edward's place for five nights, he was a great host ! The apartment is in the perfect place to see all downtown and midtown (on foot for the bravest ;) ), we really appreciated that !
Thank you Edward for your welcome ![QWERTY123]Edward was a good host. Cool guy and accommodating. The place was as advertised, and no surprises is a good thing. The only thing guests should be aware of is that one of the rooms doesn't have AC (don't worry, no false advertising about that). Overall, good location and decent place for the price.[QWERTY123]Good guy, nice and simple place,  quiet,  cheap,  private,  convenient spot, enjoyable .[QWERTY123]An amazing experience for me and my friends. We stayed in Edward's place more than a month and we found a great hospitality, friendship and courtesy. Edward was so nice and very available with us. The apartment is comfortable and quite. It's in the heart of the East Village close everything you need and about ten minutes walk from the subway. I recommend it to all people that wants to stay in a friendly place. Thanks for everything. I enjoyed my stay in my loved New York!!![QWERTY123]A modest room in a good location and very reasonable priced for staying in Manhattan. Everything was clean and prepared and Edward was an excellent host.[QWERTY123]Edward fue muy acogedor, nos explicó todo lo que necesitamos.
Tuvimos un pequeño problema en la casa, que Edward no tardó nada en solucionar. Muy buena atención! 
La casa es muy básica, localizada en zona tranquila y sin ruidos.
Para repetir![QWERTY123]Edward was a great host, friendly and communicative.  The listing was exactly as advertised- an (extremely) comfortable bed, clean linens, and fantastic location.[QWERTY123]If you've found this place it's because you're looking a budget apartment with all the basics, and that's exactly what you will get. 

It is well-located and secure (the neighbourhood as well as the apartment / room). There is a full kitchen, bathroom and desk available to use. The bed is comfortable and the door locks, the neighbourhood is quiet except for emergency sirens, but you get them everywhere. 

It is perfect as a launching pad to explore the east side and greater Manhattan. It's about a 10min walk to the subway. And walking distance from lower east side (LES) district & east village which means lots of bars, coffee shops, vintage and boutique clothes. 

Edward doesn't live there any more but is very friendly and facilitated the check in with ease (he has been doing this for years) and gave us a few tips. The building manager lives there but you won't see him very very often. 

A few downsides:
- as a basement apartment there is no natural light , so not good vibe if you're spending lots of time in there (but why would you be??)
- like all older buildings in NY, the heating turns on / off based on outside temp, so sometimes it is too cold or too hot
- because access is via the interior courtyard, you have to walk past rubbish dumps to get in (on rubbish days)
- a few baby cockroaches around, also unavoidable in basement apartments. The apartment itself is clean and well kept. 
- we had a problem with the draft coming through the window because of the new AC unit but Edward is going to fix it. 

All in all, great value, not for the fussy traveller, but great for anyone who is keen to get immersed in NYC and wants a safe place to sleep at night! 
[QWERTY123]appartement tres bon marche qui rempli a la perfection son role.
Edward est charmant, sympathique disponible et donne de precieux conseils sur le quartier.
la chambre est propre les draps sont changes avant et apres notre depart.
Edward laisse l acces libre a son ordinateur.

Thank you very much Edward[QWERTY123]We enjoyed our trip at Edward's place. The apartment is in a great location, close to everything. No noise in the room, we can drop off the suitcase for the last day. Edward cleaned the room and changed the sheets before that we moved in! Thanks[QWERTY123]Edward is a great guy.  I only used the place to shower and sleep and felt very safe.  The neighborhood is quiet and has a great ramen place right next to it.  Would stay again![QWERTY123]Small room in big city.[QWERTY123]I stayed at this location from 11/27 - 11/30.  Edward was a good host...clean sheets, offered suggestions, access to Internet and bed was real comfortable.  Not far from subway station and about a 15 minute walk from great bars and restaurants.  Overall, a great stay[QWERTY123]Edward's lower east side apartment was perfect for what we were looking for: good, safe location, near subway/bus, clean bed, shower, a place to keep our stuff and CHEAP! This small basement flat has a kitchen if you like to cook for yourself, there is space in two other bedrooms but we had the place to ourselves almost the whole time we were there. The key hand-off was great and Edward accommodated our early arrival with no difficulty. There is a lot to do in the immediate vicinity & awesome ramen 10 ft from the front door (Minca, yum!). Thanks for making our stay in New York so great, Edward.[QWERTY123]its convenience to everywhere
good for short stay[QWERTY123]Edward was incredibly easy to work with. He is very attentive at answering his phone. The room was clean, the bed was comfortable, and it felt very home-y. This is a great place to stay if you want to explore Manhattan- very accessible to most forms of transportation. I'd definitely recommend this room to any traveler, and should I come back to NYC any time soon, I'll be checking with Edward first when making reservations.[QWERTY123]Cheap, easy-going and in a great location. It was snowing outside and the room was still really warm. Great for anyone who only needs a place to sleep, wash and store their belongings.[QWERTY123]Slightly confused on when I arrived how to get into the building, and who to contact. Other than that, absolutely wonderful experience and location. Probably one of the quietest blocks in NYC, right next to one of the best ramen restaurants[QWERTY123]This was our first stay in New York and our first time using AirBnB so we don't have much to compare it to, but Edward was very friendly and accommodating. We were forced to stay an extra day because of the terrible weather and he even offered us a discount on the last night we stayed. The location is cool, there is a great burger shop attached to the building and bar down the street. The subway was nearby and the neighborhood was very interesting and safe. Definitely the best possible experience for someone looking to really get to know the city.[QWERTY123]I went by Edward for the week-end. His apartment is conveniently located clean and affordable. Good deal.[QWERTY123]Edward was extremely kind and helpful. In the first moment we had a little issue with communication (most part we were the guilt), but he solved it, and we have absolutely nothing to complain about him. Actually, we are very thankfull for his support.

The place is tiny, but (as the title says) cozy and clean. The neighborhood is great, and we really enjoyed all the options we had to buy things.

I recommend.
[QWERTY123]Had an AMAZING time in New York City thanks to the hospitality of Edward and Dennis, the Super.  The bed is literally like sleeping in a hug.  The best bed to sleep in  after hitting up the city.  Very close to everything the city has to offer.  It felt like our own place, which was wonderful.  Edward was very accommodating and always made contact to make sure we were comfortable.  Unlimited hot water for showers!  Always a plus!  The best first experience with AirB&B one could ask for.[QWERTY123]We enjoyed our stay - the apartment is centrally located in the cool east village, room was warm& comfy provided a good night sleep. Edward is really friendly and a great conversationalist! He was flexible with our check in/ out time and always helpful. Thank u ![QWERTY123]Edward is an awesome host, easy talk to, and knows the great places ( e.g. : Cafe, supermarket, how to go to subway stations ) in the area. The location is very good it isn't crowed area filled with tourists, so you can stay the usual life in NYC. I highly recommend staying there. Thank you for wonderful so many experiences there! His Apt is nice atmosphere, clean room, bed is super comfortable. Thanks, Edward!!![QWERTY123]A very basic room which has just what you need - the main attraction is great location. A good option if you want to save on New York accommodation. Friendly and helpful host. Clean, quiet to sleep. Very good wifi.[QWERTY123]An affordable room, convenient location, mostly a place to sleep at night, take a bath in the morning and prepare your breakfast (but what else do you need if you are visiting NY?) Edward is a nice and easy host who always is ready to solve any of your requiriments.[QWERTY123]What you see is what you get, small room in basement with no view but you stay here for the location and nothing else. Shared bathroom and kitchen were clean enough and Edward was a very nice and friendly host. Maybe the wall between the two rooms was a bit too thin. Anyway, I wanted a place in the middle of my favourite NYC area where I could sleep and keep my stuff and it's a good and affordable option for a weekend or a couple of days.[QWERTY123]Edward is very kind and generous.   The place is so great and convenient to other famous locations.   For me, I love most of the things here.   However, you have to understand this is NYC.   So, if you have enough experience in NYC, you will know that this place is very good.   For me, I visit NYC over 10 times.   Thus, I can tell you from my experience.[QWERTY123]Very accommodating on very short notice (2 days!). Edward was very fast at communication, was flexible with the check-in/check-out. The place was just as described. We were very happy with our first airbnb experience. Thanks![QWERTY123]The host was fantastic. Edward was very helpful to me. I had to stay somewhere last minute and it was a very nice room.[QWERTY123]Edward was a lovely host. Very helpful and easy to get hold of. The place was just as described. No nasty surprises. Which is exactly what you want on your holiday. The location was great. Not far from everything. Nice quiet (considering it's in NY) and safe neighbourhood. but it's not a boring neighbourhood. Good eating places right at the front door. Everything went smoothly which I'm so grateful for! Thanks Edward![QWERTY123]Edward was super helpful throughout stay. I really enjoyed the location of the apt and extended my stay for 2 more nights after I got here.[QWERTY123]Edward's room was absolutely perfect for me… the bed was very comfortable, the air conditioning worked like a charm, and it was located in a very trendy part of the East Village. Transportation just a short walk from the apartment, and the price was right for my stay. I'll be looking up Edward again when I need a place to stay.[QWERTY123]Great location, excellent neighbourhood, close to the sights and lots of dining places around. Nice room with AC, definitely recommend this place[QWERTY123]I've had a great experience with Edward. He is kind, gentle, sweet, always responding to my needs and I felt really taken care of. I like the apartment, the bed, the location, everything. He only let in really nice people as roomates and we had so much fun together. Edward comes every week to make sure its clean, comfortable and we're doing fine. Nothing but amazing.[QWERTY123]Great Location, comfort bed, nice kitchen. 

We didn`t had much contact with Edward, but he was receptive on arrival, always helpful and even helped me with my delayed luggage (from the airline company).

Lower East Side is the best place to stay in Manhattan, for sure ! And the aptm is very well located, with a few steps from great restaurants, supermarkets and delis.

The place seems a little bigger in the pictures but and the end, it was really enough to us. Nothing different than what Edward describes here in AirBnB. Good place to stay, clean, and for an affordable price.

Recommend !
[QWERTY123]What can I say? Edward was such an amazing host. Very accommodating and easy to talk to. The place that was described is spot on. Great location in the lower east side, close to all public transportation and best of all GREAT FOOD! I would definitely recommend staying at his place if you are looking to explore NYC for the first time or anytime that is.[QWERTY123]The host canceled my reservation after arrival.[QWERTY123]Great room, close to everything.  Most reasonable price I saw listed, and in the center of alphabet city.  It was quiet and pleasant.  I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a place in Manhattan.[QWERTY123]It's a small space but all we really needed for a cheap yet comfortable stay in Manhattan! Clean and priced for a smaller budget we were happy to stay with such a kind and considerate host.[QWERTY123]We stayed here for 7 days and I would describe the place as a dingy basement apartment that is decent for the price you are paying. Unfortunately, the cleanliness of the shower was unsatisfactory. We regularly stay in cheap motels while traveling. We frequently go camping and shower in public gyms/public restrooms, however we have never seen a bathroom like this.  The picture's of the bathroom on airbnb looked much cleaner.

The shower tub and walls contained yellow and orange stains throughout as well as mold. The shower curtain had stains, mildew and was slimy.  The shower head was not working properly. The shower drain was clogged. We also found a couple of cockroaches in the bathroom and our bedroom, but that may be expected in a New York City basement.

Aside from the bathtub, the rest of the apartment was okay and the bed was comfortable. The location was pretty close to public transportation and food. Edward is also very nice and accommodated our crazy check-in/check-out times. He does not live in the apartment, but we didn't have problems reaching him. We would stay here again if the bathroom can be fixed/cleaned.

[QWERTY123]Basic room in basement apartment in a great location. Room is quiet and bed is comfy. Good base for exploring NYC - close to metro, cafés, bars and shops. 
Great communication with Edward leading up to our arrival and throughout our stay.[QWERTY123]The place is pretty bare-bones but the location is great and the bedroom is more than adequate. Edward is friendly and hospitable, and very easy to get ahold of. The bathroom left some cleanliness to be desired but it was also very old, so it could just be one of those bathrooms that always looks kind of gross even when it's just been cleaned. Overall, a decent place if you're willing to ""slum it"" a little in exchange for a great and budget-friendly location.[QWERTY123]El apartamento está muy bien situado...y dentro de ella tienes de todo. Cierto es q es un sótano y el patio de acceso no está en buenas condiciones. Pero calidad/precio, es recomendable. Edward es muy amable! :)[QWERTY123]The place is very close to great food places and subways not too far to walk from! My brother and I felt that the simplicity of the room to just sleep in and safely store our belongings was great! The bathroom could use a little fixing up but other than that, our stay was great and Edward is a very friendly host! We tried the burger place and ramen place right next to the appartment and they both were amazing! So awesome that it's right there![QWERTY123]This apartment was small, but comfortable. NYC is an expensive place to stay and Edward has done a great job of providing comfortable accommodation for those on a budget. Location was fantastic, near plenty of shops and restaurants with a great calm hipster vibe. The apartment itself is small and dark (being a basement apartment), but this is no issue if you are a busy traveller looking to spend your days out and about exploring. Downsides: the apartment was cold at night, quite old and a little dingy. The wifi was not working during our week long stay, despite Edward's efforts to fix this. Edward however was a great host; always contactable and is doing his best to improve the place. He was always friendly and helpful if we had any questions.[QWERTY123]Had to book on very short notice (same day booking) but Edward answered right away and he organised everything very fast. He is a great host, you find everything you need in the apartment. Thanks again![QWERTY123]The room was exactly what we expected it to be: basic and clean, and the location is perfect for exploring NYC. Edward is a great guy, and he was a very helpful host before and during our stay.[QWERTY123]Edward is a great guy and he is an inspiring actor. Which is awesome to meet. His place is cheap and Edward supplies everything! From the room to bath towels. There are also extra shower stuff supplied, but this was my first time using AirBNB, I ended up using my own stuff. Great place. There are plenty of places to eat and drink! You are 10 minute walk away from LES. You are smack in the middle of Alphabet City, and few minutes away from St. Mark's Place. I will highly consider this place for a budget and enjoy the night life.[QWERTY123]I'm very glad I stayed at this place,  had an amazing time here. very good price and the lower East village is a great neighbourhood to stay in, it's close to everything and safe.   The bedroom is big enough for 2 people and the bed is very comfortable and big.  Edward is friendly, helpful and quick to return messages if you need to contact him.  I highly recommend staying at this place.[QWERTY123]Eric was great communicating with me, and made me feel welcome from the beginning. It is a small and cozy room, and is great for the price - and the central location. This is a great place for someone who spends most of their time out of the apartment![QWERTY123]Edward was a great host. He was responsive to questions and very helpful in resolving any issues that came up. A friend and I visited for a week from Texas and stayed in one of the three bedrooms. The other two rooms were rented out to 4 others. There is a shared bathroom that is small. The cleanliness was satisfactory but there may have been a cockroach infestation as we saw more roaches than we cared to count in the kitchen area and bathroom.[QWERTY123]Great room and great price! The location was perfect for us and near lots of cool restaurants and bars. East Village was the perfect spot for our New Years celebrations. Edward was very helpful and answered all of our questions. The room was clean and cosy and the bed was very comfortable.[QWERTY123]Everything went great, the basement is cozy and the bed is comfortable. The neighborhood has a lot of life, specially in the night.[QWERTY123]Edward' place is in a great location not far from the metro to reach ""uptown"" and ""downtown"" in a very short time. The apartment, however, is not very quiet, lots of noise from neighbors. But, it is functional and clean, the room is simple but practical. Overall, I'm quite satisfied with the value for money. Bedding is very good, and Edward provides towels, shampoo and shower gel, big plus! Thank U ![QWERTY123]Todo muy bien! Edward es genial, y se ocupa mucho del departamento! Todo muy limpio siempre, algunas cucas, pero se estaba solucionando. El barrio esta muy bien! Lo recomiendo! Everithing was great! Edward is an amazing host![QWERTY123]Edward was on POINT!  He was very well prepared and gave me a lot of notice on what to do before my trip. He was kind, very personable, and the place was better than what I imagined!  Even though there was one shared bathroom, I honestly had no problem with it at all!  (me and my long showers)  I never notice when the other tenants were using it, and all of our schedules for some reason offset one another because I honestly never even saw the other tenants!  This place is perfect for someone who wants to enjoy the city and rest in the middle of the day because being a tourist can be exhausting.  This place is super close to the subway stop, and it's next to a lot of great VEGAN restaurants as well!  I love the Lower East Side, and I'm definitely going to try to book this place again if it's available the next time I'm in town.  Thank you so much again, Edward![QWERTY123]The house is so clean and location is great. You can go everywhere by subway. Edward is a cool guy, he helped me to explore the city and neighborhood also.[QWERTY123]Clean and great room. Edward is an awesome host. Will definitely look up this place again when next time around. Recommended.[QWERTY123]Edward is an EXCELLENT host with fabulous communication skills and prompt replies. He is also willing to work with you to accommodate different arrival times, etc. Most impressive were the many thoughtful touches, such as having a computer and printer available, or providing recommendations for eateries, etc. The space is much larger than it appears in the photos and the bed is fabulously comfortable. Plenty of room to hang your clothing with provided hangars. Hair dryers, shampoo, dishes, too many little comforts were easily accessible. Everything is quite clean, including the bathroom. I would stay here again in an INSTANT and highly recommend it to anyone who wants a centrally located, friendly clean, reasonably priced accommodation to enjoy the fabulous city and feel safe. I always felt safe here.[QWERTY123]Hosting more than 300 people means quality: email with all the informations, flexible check in and check out and last but not least Edward helped us to bring our luggages. The house is essential and it has everything. It is located in a great neighborhood with a lot of restaurants, pubs and near the subway. I recommend this place.[QWERTY123]Boendet hos Edward var bra. Vi hade tillgång till ett sovrum och ett gemensamt kök och badrum som vi delade med ett annat airbnb-rum och Edwards kompis Dennis som bodde där permanent. Lägenheterna ligger i en källare. Ett bra badrum med fräsch toalett och dusch/badkar. Generellt sett var det bra städat och relativt fräscht överallt. Något sämre möjligheter till att laga mat och ha någonstans att äta, då vardagsrummet är väldigt litet och utan matbord.

Läget är perfekt. Nära till allt, både kommunikationer, restauranger och bra områden. 
Jag kan verkligen rekommendera boendet hos Edward. Både Edward och Dennis (som bodde där) var enkla att få tag på och tillmötesgående. Vi kommer att bo där igen nästa gång vi kommer till New York.[QWERTY123]Edward is a great host. He communicated clearly and promptly with me. For the price and convenience I have no complaints.[QWERTY123]Edward was a very nice host. I met some accidents and talked with Edward. He gave me valuable advice and we figured my problem perfectly.[QWERTY123]The place was comfortable and clean, and the location was amazing, would definitely stay here again[QWERTY123]Edward is the most professional airbnb host I've ever met. Not only is his place super clean, he is also very hospitable - he was more than willing to accommodate my requests and gave me some tips on NYC. The location of his place is very central in the east village in a safe and quiet area. I would definitely stay at Edward's again when in New York.[QWERTY123]Nice room in a fantastic location. Edward is very nice and accommodating too. Enjoyed the stay![QWERTY123]Edward and his rommates Dennis are nice guy.  They are very friendly to talk to.  We even drink together during our conversation.  I strongly recommend other guests to stay with them in the future.[QWERTY123]I had a great time at Edward's place. The room was clean and cozy and the bed was so comfortable! The location was perfect for what I needed. I didn't meet Edward nor his roommates, but they were easily reachable if I had any concerns. There was a slight snafu with getting the keys: Edward was away on a business trip and his roommate Isai was at work so they left the keys for me at a local coffee shop. However, the wrong name had been given to the people at the shop so when I told them my name, they said there were no keys for me. However, once I managed to get in contact with Isai and got the situation sorted, it was smooth sailing from there. Overall, I had a great experience and if I'm in NYC in the future, will definitely consider staying here again.[QWERTY123]The room was quite humid, even with the a/c on and there were a lot of cockroaches mainly in the kitchen but also in the bathroom and room.
We didn't meet Edward, but he checked in on us by messages and had Dennis, who lived in another room in the basement, to help us.
The neighborhood was great and close to everything, but a bit dirty.
We lived there for two weeks and it  was ok, but we will not stay there again mainly because of the cockroaches.[QWERTY123]Le logement est spacieux, confortable, et l'hôte est à l'écoute, ses instructions sont claires et son tarif raisonnable. Parfait ![QWERTY123]We weren't impressed. There needed a bit of cleaning and it was in a basement with no opportunity to open a window, but there was air-conditioning.[QWERTY123]The location is great; close to many restaurants, pubs, entertainment venues,etc... in east village.

The host is very communicative; I haven't met Edward but he was always helpful in his replies to my messages. I was delayed to arrive to New York and check-in was flexible. I've also had a last minute visit from a friend and Edward agreed to let my friend stay with me for one night.

One negative aspect. The flat is in the basement as mentioned in the ad so it is not very pleasant having to walk next to the building waste disposal containers to go in the flat. But the main unpleasant aspect were the cockroaches in the room, kitchen and bathroom. I suggest for the sake of future visitors to make an extra effort to apply additional spray treatment in the flat for pest control.  
[QWERTY123]Edward is a nice guy, very ""professional"" with useful guide tips. It's a 3-room flat, 2 for rent, shared kitcken and bathroom. Good for bagpackers if just taking a sleep at night after an exausting trip day in NYC. Superior location in Manhattan, easy access to metro, restaurant and grocery.[QWERTY123]Nice host - good location - reasonably clean accommodations.
The room is in a basement suite in the back of the building, and while the place itself is reasonable, the entrance way is a bit stark.
Still a reasonably good place to stay.
[QWERTY123]The room looks exactly like the pictures. The bed is super comfortable and also there's a full length mirror, which I appreciated much so. The bathroom is small, but I did not mind. The location is everything! There are many cafes, bars, and restaurants around the area but what won me over was the people. Everyone I have encountered in the neighborhood was really kind. Edward is very friendly and nice. If I'm ever in New York again, I would stay at Edward's place again.[QWERTY123]Edward is great. He was super helpful and quick at responding, only tries to accommodate. The apartment is clean and well located although a bit of a hike to the subway but manageable. All in all a good experience and would recommend to anyone :)[QWERTY123]Edward is the perfect host, always available and kind. The room is small but has everything needed.[QWERTY123]I had a great stay here . It's really the little things that make a difference . For example : the bed was super comfy , sheet where clean , bathroom was clean. Also my host was very helpful . I would forsure like to stay here . It's in an excellent area and the the apartment was very quiet so I slept well. Also there is the best Ramen place ever right next store called "" Mica ""[QWERTY123]Edward is a very good host. If you want to stay in Manhattan for a great price and don't know anywhere to stay or can't afford a fancy hotel. Edward has the place for you! It is easy to get to, it has a clean shared bathroom, a lockable too
, but you rarely see the other people. I'd stay there again![QWERTY123]Edward was a wonderful host. We had some problems at the airport and it took us longer than expected to arrive at his place. Despite this late arrival, Edward was very cool, he waited for us, gave us a tour and some tips about the city. 
The apartment was neat and came regularly to clean during our stay.
The location was very convenient, close to all touristic places. The flat is provided with everything you need (wifi; computer; printer; towels ...)  
We had a pleasant stay, it was our first time in New York and we will definitely go back this amazing city.[QWERTY123]Edwards Apartment ist ein sehr guter Ausgangspunkt Alphabet City / das East Village zu erkunden. Das Bett ist wunderbar und Edward ein sehr guter Gastgeber. Die Küche habe ich nicht benutzt, im Kühlschrank ist eine Menge Platz. Wi-Fi und gemeinsamer Computer waren ein Top![QWERTY123]We stayed at Edward's place over thanksgiving weekend, and it was a great stay. Edward was out of town the day we arrived but arranged for the super to give us our keys when we arrived. Also, he was almost always available if we had any questions. The place is small but well furnished, and kept very clean. There are two rooms right next to each other, both of which he rents out; our co-guests were very nice! My only (minor) complaint is that there are very few windows in the whole place, which can make it feel very small. Lastly, the location is pretty good; tons of restaurants and bars nearby, if you are into eating and drinking and that kind of thing.[QWERTY123]Great room with a good location. Edward was so nice and helpful! We would definitely recommend Edward and his room.[QWERTY123]I was staying at Edward place only few days and then left. I can't say bad about him as we never met, but one think, for to enter into apartments you have to walk through the trash and inside of apt there is some cockroaches.[QWERTY123]I had an absolute wonderful time staying at Edward's East Village apartment. The room was exactly like pictured. There was fresh linen, towels, hairdryer, shampoo etc. provided. And wifi! Everything was nice and Edward was the perfect host and super easy to get in touch with. Waiting keys in hand as I arrived. The area was perfect, and the street provided easy access to great restaurants, bars and grocery shopping. Would definitely recommend this to friends, and would love to stay again. Thumbs up![QWERTY123]I stayed just the one night at Edwards Airbnb and found him a very helpful and gracious host.
He had a wealth of information about the New York and pointed me in the right direction for the best Theatre shows and where to buy the best tickets online.
All together I enjoyed my brief stay.[QWERTY123]Edwin was very proactive in his communications and made every effort to meet with us to welcome us (unfortunately we couldnt meet as we were running late in our arrival). Nevertheless, he found a way to get us the keys.

The room was of a perfect size - not too small, but not very large either. The apartment came with the basic amenities and was not very difficult to reach (considering some other apartments were 5 floors up a walk-up) and the neighbourhood was good as well. 

Highly recommended.[QWERTY123]We had a great time at Edwards accommodation. We stayed 10 days there. He is a great host! He was perfectly prepared to host us. Edward gave us tons of helpful informations already before arriving. Though he wasn't living in the apartment he was always available and helped us if needed. The place is great located, close to many restaurants and bars and a subway close by. You get what you see, which is exactly what we needed for your stay in NYC incl. a TV with Netflix. Great stay! Many thanks to Edward! We would definitely recommend this place.[QWERTY123]Edward was a great host, very thoughtful and provided what we needed for our stay.  The room and bed were comfortable and the kitchen adequate.  Even though it was small, nobody seemed to get in each other's way and everyone was friendly and helpful.[QWERTY123]This is a nice spot in the East Village, prime location, great value. It's east of the high traffic areas of 1st ave, so very quiet at night and in the morning. Plenty of everything very close by. 

Edward and the building super Dennis couldn't have been more on top of things. No hitches, very communicative, reached out to me more than once to make sure everything was alright.

The place was super clean, which I appreciated. It's a downstairs apt, and you have to walk through a dumpster area to get to the place which wasn't really made clear. It's a minor setback especially given the price. 

All in all it was a great experience. I'd definitely go back.[QWERTY123]Edward was a fantastic host who was always accessible to contact, gave great recommendations for local spots to check out.  The listing itself was perfect for my stay in East Village - a great central location for a lot of cafés, bars and restaurants, and very close to both train and bus to explore.  It also affords a good level of privacy if required and a nice shared space to meet your fellow travellers.[QWERTY123]On short notice Edward welcomed me to his great BnB.  Perfect East Village location.  Nearby great restaurants, bars, coffee shops.[QWERTY123]Wow this was an awesome experience.  I am really happy that we managed to find this little gem of an apartment. The location was great and so was the description.  This place is really good quality for the price.[QWERTY123]Very pleasant stay at Edward's place! 
Edward was there when we arrived and gave us lots of tips about the neighbourhood. He did not stay in the apartment but he made sure to ask if we needed anything. 
The place is clean, you have to share the bathroom and the kitchen.   The room is kind of small, so is the bathroom, but for the price and the great location in East village you can't complain! 
In definitive, I recommend it for anyone travelling on budget and seeking a nice affordable place to stay in Manhattan, close to everything (10 minutes walk to F metro)[QWERTY123]Nice stay in Edward's house ! Very good location in NYC. He was very accommodating with us : we could drop our luggage the morning...
Thank you again ![QWERTY123]Edward was great with communication and clear with the important arrival and departure information. Very clean room and exactly what I expected, great location in East Village![QWERTY123]I had a good experience at Edward's. The location is right in the heart of NYC and there is no disturbance in the (Email hidden by Airbnb) plete privacy. Only the path to the basement was little smelly. Although I never met Edward, I received all assistance from his roommate. Thank you for hosting me.[QWERTY123]Really enjoyed my stay here! It was in a convenient location, well equipped with everything you need and very clean. Edward was super quick with responding to messages and was very welcoming and gave some great advice upon check-in. 

Thanks for having me![QWERTY123]Awesome location in the East Village and a great host! Edward was super about communicating about the room and arrival details, plus he kept in touch throughout the week to check that everything was going well. He was helpful as well, making sure I knew how to get around the city and lending me an umbrella when it rained. The room was comfortable, with room for my suitcase and carry-on, plus a desk and shelves. Photos in the listing were very accurate. Because the apartment is in the basement, when it got really hot outside (over 90 F), the common area did kind of have that New York smell, but the air in the room was always fresh, plus the AC made it very comfortable. It's several blocks' walk to the subway (F line), but there are actually a ton of restaurants, shops, and a grocery store within a block or two, plus plenty of nightlife, so you don't really need to go far if you don't want to. Even so, because the apartment doesn't face the street (and it's a quiet side street), there were no issues at all with noise. I was there a week and didn't spend too much time in the apartment, mostly using it as a home base for coming and going, but I had a great trip, and I'd definitely stay there again![QWERTY123]We did not meet Edward but he did everything to allow us a good stay. The Room was fine and effective. East Village is the best neiborhood, full of different Street foods and clubs.[QWERTY123]Friendly host at a decent location in Manhattan. Walking distance to three different subway lines. Edward was very flexible with our check-in and check-out times, and he was helpful in recommending places to eat and how to get around the area. He checked in with us mid-stay to see if we needed anything and had taken care of it by the time we got back that night.[QWERTY123]Edward is really nice! He provided warm hospitality to us and told us a lot of great places nearby. The room is just like the photos. It's not so big but with everything you need![QWERTY123]El alojamiento en general está muy bien, buena ubicación con muchos locales para salir y tomar algo y un supermercado grande abierto las 24h. La habitación era cómoda, falla que no tenga ventanas. El cuarto de baño estaba limpio aunque era pequeño y a veces resulta un poco incómodo. El anfitrión estuvo en todo momento disponible y atento. Muy recomendable.[QWERTY123]Great area for eateries and drinkeries.
Close access to three subeay lines.
Spacious and clean room with fridge, kitchen and netflix available :)
Recommended![QWERTY123]Eduard is a really great and nice host, he is friendly and really helpful!  the neighborhood is fantastic, lots of bars and good restaurants! the room is pretty small, but you have everything you need for a few days! It was a little bit cold at the beginning in the room, but there is a heater which helped us lot! All in all, it was a nice stay for four days at Eduards place! Thanks a lot! :)[QWERTY123]I never got the chance to meet Edward personally, but nevertheless, he was very helpful, accommodating and responsive prior to and throughout my stay. I did link up with his roommate, Dennis, who was also very helpful and welcoming to me. The neighborhood is very pleasant and there was no concern with any noise, so I definitely had a good night's rest. I highly recommend this place to anyone and I'd definitely come back here again whenever I visit NYC again.[QWERTY123]Edward was very friendly, apartment was in a good location and apartment is pretty decent for the price. We had a good stay. 

Thanks Edward.[QWERTY123]The experience was super good. The apartment is in a great location, especially if you are young![QWERTY123]Quite, warm and clean[QWERTY123]Edward's place is a cosy spot for New York returners, I'd say, for people who are gone all day & come back to sleep. It is close to restaurants & bars as well as the bus line which really takes you anywhere but also to the next train station. It's held clean & the bed is comfortable. I did not spend so much time in the apt. since I came to explore the city. I couldn't meet Edward in person but he was always available & thankfully very easygoing with my checking in & out ~ Thank you very much![QWERTY123]The location is great, pictures and description of the place are acquired.  My hosts would do anything to help out and make you feel very comfortable.  I'd definitely go back again.  Thank you so much![QWERTY123]great location and value[QWERTY123]Very kind and great spot.[QWERTY123]Edward is a great host, very communicative and helpful at all times. The apartment is close to an array of bars, restaurants and shopping. I'd definitely stay here again![QWERTY123]Private, safe, clean and very cool neighborhood. Ed was very accessible, cordial and helpful. Will do again.
[QWERTY123]Wonderful place in thw heart of NYC. If you want a no frills, relaxed place to stay with wonderful transport links this is it. Edward is a great host and really helpful.[QWERTY123]great cozy place, with walkable distance to subway. Edward is responsive and friendly.[QWERTY123]It's a really great location with quite a lot going on within walking distance as well as a subway close by, making it easy to get around[QWERTY123]I enjoyed staying at Edward's in East Village NYC. The room is small, but nice and clean, with a comfy double bed and bonus common area with kitchen.
There is all you need, from USB chargers to fast WiFi connection to hot shower - just no windows as it's a basement apartment.
There is always another guest in the adjacent room, so you may mingle with fellow travelers, but don't worry - your room comes with a lock and key.
Edward is a very hospitable person with excellent communication who can make you feel welcome in an instant.
The location is good with a 5-10 minute walk to the nearest Subway, offering quick and easy access to Lower or Upper Manhattan.[QWERTY123]Puntual, amigable y en una buena ubicacion.[QWERTY123]place was exactly as expected, it worked out well for what i needed, was in a great location. only downside was sharing one bathroom with 6 people at one point. apartment has 3 other bedrooms. everyone was respectful tho. was a good value, super comfy, having roku tv and a mini fridge was nice too![QWERTY123]Edward is a model host -- great at keeping in communication and incredibly flexible. The place is small but neat, perfect for when you need a home base but might not be home very often.[QWERTY123]You have there the best spot for living the east village vibe![QWERTY123]Great place for the location and price. Comfy bed and tv situation. Edward was very responsive and an excellent communicator. Roomies were cool.[QWERTY123]Appartamento piccolo ma tenuto benissimo! Tutto pulito e ordinato! Edward è un ragazzo molto alla mano e disponibile![QWERTY123]ﾎｽﾄのｴﾄﾞﾜｰﾄﾞはすごい親切です｡人柄も良く､ｱﾄﾞﾊﾞｲｽもくれます｡もし､ここを利用するときは､何でも相談すると良いと思います｡[QWERTY123]best neighborhood[QWERTY123]Edward is awesome, his place is quaint and quiet. The ideal place for a short stay or a spot for when you need to find a permanent place. Edward is very responsive and super accommodating to anything you might need.[QWERTY123]Edward is an amazing host! He was great at communicating from the time I booked the room up until the time I left. I traveled alone for the first time in NYC and felt safe and looked out for. Edward was quick to respond to any questions I had and met me to check in and show me around. 
The room is exactly as described and perfect for a light traveler looking for a spot to chill for the night. 
I would definitely recommend Edwards place and will stay here again on my next trip back.[QWERTY123]What a unique find! Location is incredible. Efficient use of space and included amenities. Funky cool. 

This is a basement apartment and has a shared bath with other guests. Cleanliness was an issue for me with the other guest not having the same habits as mine, but I was able keep things clean myself. 

Kitchen has everything, gas stove, large fridge, mini fridge in room. In my room bed took up most of the room, but also included a Roku TV with access to Netflix. Desk, place to hang clothes, side table if needed, coat hooks, lots of built in shelf storage.  So well laid out. 

If you are traveling alone and want an inexpensive place that’s centrally locates in the East Village... Edward is delightful  and his place is a true find!

I’ll be back!![QWERTY123]The place was perfect for our short weekend in the city. We arrived much later than expected and Edward happily greeted us with no issue. All the essentials are here and the location is awesome. The space is perfect for those who plan so spend most time exploring the city.[QWERTY123]Edward's place was the best. It is a simple place to sleep while I spent my days running around the city for interviews and for some sightseeing. It was also very clean. Highly recommended.[QWERTY123]It's good value and 30 min away from most of the famous spots. The neighborhood restaurants closes around 11, so late night offerings are limited during weekdays. Overall if you don't mind old apartments it's a good choice.[QWERTY123]Extremely helpful with checkin/checkout and anticipated my needs[QWERTY123]立地は凄く良く､部屋も広く夜でも賑やかでしかも危なくないです!
ﾊﾞｽ､地下鉄に慣れればﾏﾝﾊｯﾀﾝならどこでも一時間位でいけるので､苦になりません｡
ﾎｽﾄのｴﾄﾞﾜｰﾄﾞも素早く親切に対応
してくれます!
但し地下の部屋なので､若干虫などが､､､全然許容範囲ですが!
おすすめです![QWERTY123]Such a great NYC space. Perfect LES location. All the amenities and more (hair dryer, aircon, iron, netflix. SO good). Edward was an amazing host, quick responses to all my annoying questions and made the check in and check out experience SO smooth and was super flexible where possible. I have nothing negative to say about this place and would def return![QWERTY123]Great location, full of vibrant restaurants and bars. Communication with Edward was great although we didnt actually get to meet. His flatmate David was quite helpful. The room is as it looks, with good functioning AC and wifi. The only negative point were the numerous flies present in the common areas  of the flat (bathroom too) due to the extreme heat outside and the nearby garbage place. Apart from that, all good.[QWERTY123]The perfect place for a short stay. Location is great so you can easily walk almost anywhere. Edward was a nice host and communication was really easy. Thanks again :)[QWERTY123]This was definitely the worst  place i have ever seen . The place is located on the ground floor and created from a cellar , without windows and you have to cross mountains of trash to reach to the main door . Inside the place is completely old , messed up and dirty . Our room itself was very small  and dark , the mattress full of bumps and couvert with old dark bedsheets . On the sealing there are many pipes running and making noise all  night long  , the same for the old fridge . The shared bad room , without window , was very small , old and incredible dirty !!!!!! The place was also full of flies , probably because of the trash in front of the door where you can see also ratts at night .[QWERTY123]Great place to experience true NYC.[QWERTY123]Good location. We enjoyed our holiday)[QWERTY123]Edward was an outstanding host. His knowledge of NYC was comprehensive, he was attentive to my communications, and had a great personality to boot. I would  unreservedly recommend staying with him![QWERTY123]El mejor spot del east village. Todo Perfecto. Mil gracias !"	40.722901227616475	-73.98199038725582	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/12192	2	68.0	0.725
86	25235	"We had the privilege of being the ""inaugural"" guests in The Stuydio 2.  What a wonderful time we had!  The apartment is in a lovely neighborhood, with access to the subway a few blocks away.  We drove from the midwest and were delighted to be able to park our car at no charge on the street and only had to move it once to accommodate the street cleaning schedule.

Nichelle was welcoming, accommodating and a lot of fun.  Every suggestion for a place to eat (""Peaches"", ""Saraghina"", ""The Tiny Cup"") and shop (Food Dimensions) were right on.  From the moment we met her we felt it was very important to her that we have a good time while under her care. And we most certainly felt cared for.

The apartment is a very large 2 bedroom with a great kitchen, a table to eat at and a washer and dryer.  It has lots of light and is very warm and inviting.  I could not believe how spacious it was with several closets and open space.

After reading a previous negative review, I feel I need to respond to some of the comments.  If you are looking for a place where someone is available 24 hours a day, maid service at a moments notice and room service, this would not be the place for you - no Bed and Breakfast would be.  Nichelle is a Bed and Breakfast host, not a hotel.   I make that point because that is part of the appeal for me...it is what helps to make me feel at home - because I am sharing someone's home. It means kids need to be picked up at school, appointments happen, your host may have another job and you work around it all and  remain flexible.  Again, you are sharing someone's home and the very affordable price reflects that.  I have stayed in many Bed and Breakfasts over the years and I have to say that Nichelle is one of the best hosts I have ever had.

Nichelle served us a light breakfast on the weekdays and hot breakfasts with more food on the weekends.  Each breakfast included fresh fruit and some type of pastry. If we had a special request, she was very accommodating.

I would highly recommend both ""Stuydios"" as we had a chance to see her other apartment during our stay.  Since we have family in NY and plan on returning, my first call will be to Nichelle to book a room.[QWERTY123]Staying at Nichelle's Stuydio was great. Not only were her 2 boys adorable, she was a fabulous host. She was there to meet us when we got lost on our way, had great reviews of places in the area and made breakfast that was 2nd to none. My boyfriend and I will definitely be staying here again[QWERTY123]Studio 2 is wonderful appartment. We enjoyed staying there from our first moment. Breakfast was gorgous and delicous. Nichelle is very kind and helpful. We will tell our friends about nice place and Nichelle's hospitality. 
Thanks.[QWERTY123]My apologies for not posting this sooner!  WE LOVED our trip and staying with Nichelle and her family was perfect.  We were four young designers doing shows and selling our wares and the Studyio provided the perfect place to come home to!
It was clean, had the essentials, great bathroom, large bedrooms and common areas, easy for us to spread out and put our stuff together.
We were able to do our laundry, which was nice as we had been on the road for 10 days.  
The family was welcoming, it was quiet but we were able to be ourselves too.  Enjoyed the fact that there was no TV on our stay =)  I am a coffee drinker and Nichelle brought me a coffee maker, there was a full kitchen, so we prepared many of our meals and ordered in one night after a long day out.  Parking was easy on the street and the train was just a couple of blocks and easy to navigate. 

Thank you so much for a great place to stay!!![QWERTY123]As first timers to Airbnb & to the US we were in uncharted territory - but we experienced the best it had to offer - Nichelle's amazing apartment & her hospitality!! It was welcoming for the first contact and continued throughout the stay. The apartment is spacious, with little comforts thrown in! Her boys are gorgeous just like Nichelle is! She was extremely accommodating and her suggestions on dining out were brilliant. If you want a change from the coldness of a hotel and the warmth of a real apartment, throw in some gracious and geniune hospitality and a splash of real neighbourhood - this is the place for you. It's real, and warm and brilliant!! Thank you Nichelle for our baby girl's 1st birthday cupcake tower, wonderful breaky and your generous hospitality - it made our experience in NYC!![QWERTY123]This was our first time of using airbnb having only just found out about it a few months ago and it would be an understatement to say that we were more than skeptical! We weren't sure of how legit the owners would be and also the condition of the actual apartments. However, along came Nichelle (and her apartment) and washed away all of our doubts and fears. Nichelle is SO lovely and responded so promptly to our queries and was helpful. Her apartment is amazing and is in a very good location too (We love Brooklyn). There was music playing upon our arrival and she even left some goodies for us in the fridge. The apartment and experience was more than we could have wished for and we're looking forward to visiting again!

Thanks to Nichelle and Kirk for their wonderful hospitality. You really made our stay a very enjoyable one.

The Ghana girls :)[QWERTY123]It was great to spend time in your (Website hidden by Airbnb) was only a week but i was great.
Samuel and I spent an excellent moment at Nichelle's.Her apartment is perfectly decorated, welcoming and comfortable.
She is of very good advice as regards the neighborhood, the restaurants and place to be visited.
A thing is sure, during our next journey in New York we shall return to see Nichelle.[QWERTY123]This was a 5 star experience!  Nichelle was welcoming even though she herself was not able to be there!  She arranged to have someone meet and greet us and show us around the clean and well appointed apartment!  And then Nichelle called me in the evening to make sure everything was OK!  Just in time cause I couldn't figure out how to work the TV!!  I am challenged!  Not only did she talk me thru how to operate the TV......she called back a little while later to make sure everything was still OK!

I would definately stay again![QWERTY123]The stay at Nichelles' apt was great; she was present and really helpful. The apt is very clean and lack of nothing. The price is really good and you can walk to the Utica subway station (10 min) to catch the A line heading to Manhattan pretty fast; Enjoy it![QWERTY123]the app. is fatastic. You have all what you need. Even Internet. It is clean and silent and is located in a very sympatic area. NIchelle is more than a host and her breakfast is awesome. I have had a fantastic time.[QWERTY123]Nichelle, Nichelle, Nichelle....you are totally awesome. The place was GREAT, comfortable, clean and CLEAN lol. Thanks again for hosting us. We look forward to seeing you again soon. BTW....breakfast....GREAT![QWERTY123]The room and hospitality were great!  We would definitely recommend this to anyone.[QWERTY123]Fantastic place to stay ..Nichelle was very accommodating and truly went the extra mile for us thank you so much Nichelle, We were there during the week so missed out on her weekend breakfast so she prepared a beautiful breakfast for us on our last day it was yummy. and when we arrived back late from Washington DC she agreed to wait up for us 
our only regret was we weren't there long enough. the neighbourhood is great locals were very friendly and helpful.
The A train was great we were able to get to everywhere we wanted to go with ease and on the last day i travel on the subway by myself and felt very safe even had a young gentleman stand and offer me his seat. 
i would truly reccomend Nichelle's place to anyone 
and i will be sure to go back on my next visit

[QWERTY123]I encourage you not to think twice about staying with Nichelle, if its available book it now!! 
We had an amazing time in Brooklyn and really felt like this was our home for the weekend.  The place is beautiful, huge, clean, comfortable. Nichelle's prompt communication prior to our arrival helped ease my fears and when she welcomed us like friends I knew we had made the right decision. Thank-you for our wonderful breakfast, the eggs in the fridge, tea on the counter and for spending time chatting with us.  It was a blessing to meet you and I can't wait to stay at ""our"" Brooklyn apartment again.[QWERTY123]ENGLISH : It was just perfect for our first stay with airbnb. We arrived late around 10pm but she was out even before we could ring, she heard us coming. The apartment was exactly what we needed for us (couple with two kids). She was helpful and everything was perfect.
FRANCAIS : je recommande vivement. Nichelle est adorable, aucune mauvaise surprise, quartier très calme, en 15' on est au métro qui va en express (20' pour Manhattan). 
DEUTSCH : eine sehr gute Adresse, wir waren begeistert. Es ist auch die Gelegenheit Brooklyn zu besuchen. Nichelle ist einfach eine sehr angenehme Person, sehr hilfbereit. 1A.[QWERTY123]There's no much to say about Nichelle and her apartment they both wicked awesome!! I stayed with my sister and my cousin for the Halloween weekend. Neadless to say being in NY is the first time that I felt so cozy at a place, that even though we were in the big apple we  decided to stay home and  watch a movie for the first night rather than going out . Since the begining we felt overwhelmed and instead of making business from owner to tenant we made another friend! Can't wait for the next girls night out :) . Thanks for everything. From Boston: Jenn, Rosanna & Natacha... Besos![QWERTY123]I can only repeat what I've said before: our second stay at Nichelle's place was just as great as the first one![QWERTY123]We can't thank enough Nichelle and her welcoming stay at ""the Stuydio 2"". 

As first time users of Airbnb, we still had our doubts about the apartment, neighborhood, etc... That was until we met Nichelle and her warm and vibrant personality.

She made us feel at home right at our arrival (she was at the front door waiting for us when we got there at 11:30pm). Place was spotless clean, very nice, bright  and confortable. We loved the lovely little details (she left us a basket with granola bars and chocolates for us to munch). 

Installations were A+, we had everything from fresh ground coffee and coffee maker to kitchen and dinnerware. Linens we're clean and crisp. And most important the calefaction was working perfectly now that the chilly days began. We received more than we expected.  

Apartment was only 3 blocks away from subway station A and C that carried us in less than 30 minutes to Time Square 42nd st (with stops at fulton st, chambers st, union square, penn station and so on directly into Manhatan). Neighborhood was fine, with 2 delimarket stores at walking distance.

Her 2 breakfast were just amazing. 

We recommend if you plan to visit NYC to stay at The Stuydio![QWERTY123]we had a great time staying at nichelle's; her house is warm, comforting and very welcoming - so is she, very much :) the place is clean and homely furnished; accomodated for 4, but if willing to share easily fitting 6 people. it's in good walking distance to the subway and in a nice residential neighbohood. thanks so much for having all of us, nichelle, we loved staying with you !!![QWERTY123]My husband and I, along with another couple, had never used Airbnb.com before our week-long stay at Nichelle's Stuydio 2. We were very apprehensive, but both Nichelle and the apartment were great. 

First, let me assure anyone contemplating booking this apartment that this place is a great deal. It is exactly as advertised, and Nichelle is even better. The place was clean, tidy, and well-equipped, and we had plenty of room for both couples. The apartment is located on a nice, quite, safe street, and only a short walk from the subway station. 

Plus, Nichelle made the whole process easy. She kept in very good contact with us both before and after our reservation had been booked. She was always prompt to address any questions we had. And, her recommendations for restaurants and attractions were excellent. We were very pleased with our stay. 

Thank you Nichelle, you really made the whole process/stay enjoyable.[QWERTY123]Nichelle's house is more than beautiful. it's fantastic, big, clean, confortable, full optional. And Nichelle is amazing. She is accommodates, friendly and very kind...simply PERFECT!!! 

in Italian: 
Abbiamo trascorso 10 notti a casa di Nichelle e, che dire, è stato bellissimo! Non avevamo mai usato Airbnb per affittare un appartamento e sinceramente avevamo paura che la casa non fosse così bella come nelle foto. e invece, la casa di Nichelle è andata ben oltre ogni nostra più piacevole aspettativa! è enorme, pulitissima (e chi lo dice è una maniaca della pulizia), piena di comfort tra cui un frigo enorme, il microonde, il forno, la lavatrice con asciugatrice annessa (fantastica) e udite (Website hidden by Airbnb) vasca idromassaggio. Insomma è stata una bellissima sorpresa. E poi Nichelle è davvero una persona fantastica. E' simpaticissima, cerca di metterti a tuo agio, ti aiuta se hai bisogno, ti da consigli su cosa visitare,su dove mangiare o fare la spesa. Insomma è stata più che una padrona di casa. Abbiamo un bellissimo ricordo di lei e speriamo tanto di poterla rivedere prima o poi! Se non sapete dove alloggiare a NY la casa di Nichelle è il posto ideale![QWERTY123]Our first stay using airbnb was great. Nichelle was a great host. The breakfast was good, the neighborhood was nice, and it was only three blocks or so from the subway line.[QWERTY123]It was a pleasure to be able to live in Nichelle's place. She is very nice and the apartment is clean as well. My friends and I find this place is very peaceful for us to fellowship on Christmas.  Thank you Nichelle for the very nice hospitality.

[QWERTY123]First of all Nichelle is first rate, you need it ,she will find it. She accommodated my group with all types of things to do, go and eat.  The apartment was awesome. Very clean and spacious, it was home away from home. The area had everything you needed; grocery stores, subways and restaurants. Peaches and Saragharin's were my favorite. (Damn good pizza) Thanks for Nichelle. If you have the energy to keep up with Nichelle, go for it, you will enjoy your time and stay at a marvelous place. Can't wait to go back, not just for New York, but to  see Nichelle. LOL  Savy

[QWERTY123]The host canceled my reservation 151 days before arrival.[QWERTY123]We had a really nice stay at Nichelle's ! The flat is very clean and comfortable, not far from the subway, so it's fast and easy to get to Manhattan and anywhere else in NYC. Nichelle and her two boys are very friendly, and Nichelle was very helpful when we had a problem with our bag, lost in a bar in NYC.
If once we come back to NYC, for sure I would love to come back to her place !
The only thing I regret is that we didn't have the opportunity to taste her brunch ![QWERTY123]First time in NYC and we had a great time, much thanks to Nicelle´s help and nice apartment. 
The apartment was roomier than we had expected and situated in a nice and quiet neighborhood. It is situated about ten minutes walk from the subway which takes you directly downtown in about 15 minutes. Everybody we met in the streets were very kind and helpful. There are a lot of small food stores nearby, where you can shop grocery. Nichelle made us a delicious breakfast tray on Sundays. We stayed for two weeks and felt at home from day one.
We would love to come back someday. Thanks Nichelle!

Sweden[QWERTY123]We have stayed with 5 persons for 10 days in the nice apartement of Nichelle. The two bedrooms are very quite and spacy. Because of that and the fact we had an airmatrass of our own we did not use the sofa in the living/kitchen room. That was very convenient of course. 
The neighbourhood is very nice and quite and the subway station is 10 minutes (Ralph C-train) and 15 minutes (A express) walk away. Travalling to Manhattan takes about 20 minutes.

As an unexpected extra there is an washing/drying machine, very convenient if you stay for a longer period!

We surely recommend this apartment to our friends. 
[QWERTY123]Beautiful appartement with alot of space. About 4 blocks to the C train. Corner stores with food and drinks are only one block aways. Playground and parks are not far too. We had a nice time and enjoyed our stay at Nichelles house. The time went by too fast :-(([QWERTY123]What a wonderful experience! I stayed at the stuydio with my brother & 2 other friends for a week and we felt right away at home thanks to Nichelle warm welcome! 

The spacious apartment is located in a beautiful Brownstone in a quiet neighborhood, only a few blocks from A & C train and with lots of grocery stores around & nice restaurants (Peaches & Saraghina are the best!).

Plus, we had the chance to taste Nichelle's Sunday breakfast, so yummy and even share a nice dinner at Saraghina's, great Italian place!  We felt so at ease with Nichelle, she's very helpful and so funny, I only wish we could have stayed a bit longer and share more time to know her better... we already want to come back!

Thanks again for everything!

Silvia, Renato, Aurelie & Alex from France[QWERTY123]This apartment is absolutely wonderful! The natural light was amazing and the neighborhood was friendly. I slept in the back bedroom and the bed was super comfortable. We slept with the windows open and were awakened by the morning sun and the singing birds.
Nichelle was very attentive and easy to contact when we were out and about. The only thing I wasn't too fond of was the walk to the train station, but I am used to driving everywhere, so my legs just weren't ready. If you stay here, do yourself a favor and read and follow Nichelle's tips for the train, once we re-read them, it really made for a pleasant walk.
We had a wonderful stay at The Stuydio 2 and would definitely recommend it![QWERTY123]L'appartement est grand et clair grâce au puits-de-jour. On se sent en sécurité dans le quartier. Nichelle est sympathique et chaleureuse.[QWERTY123]The place is clean and located in a quiet and safe neighbourhood. It represents great value for the money. Recommended.[QWERTY123]The host canceled my reservation the day before arrival.[QWERTY123]We had a really nice time at Nichelle's apartments. We have stayed with 4 persons for 6 nights. Nichelle is very friendly and helpful host. The neighborhood is very nice and quiet. Subway is within 15 minutes slow walk. Thanks for everything. I will recomend this Studio2 to all my friends!!!![QWERTY123]Nichelle is very nice and friendly helper. The place is quite and safe, and the studio is clean and renovated, like on pictures.
It was a very good experience to discover brooklyn.[QWERTY123]Our stay at the Stuydio was very nice and comfortable. Nichelle and her husband are great hosts and were really nice and helpful. The Stuydio is fully equipped and the two bedrooms are both large and spacious, with big windows and lots of lights. The neighborhood is nice and quiet. Was very nice to walk towards the Subway and greet our neighbors on our way: we really felt at home. I would highly recommend it and hope to be back soon![QWERTY123]Nichelle was great. We were there for the Labor Day weekend and we felt as if we were home. The apartment was more than we expected, very spacious and beautiful.Nichelle was very helpful and extremely friendly. The only thing is that we didn't expect to be so far from the city, but the train station was just a few blocks away. Overall the stay was pleasant and we can't wait to visit again.[QWERTY123]Nichelle has been a wonderful host, warm and welcoming. We (me and my two grown up sons) spent three weeks in Stuydio 2, which provided a nice, calm retreat after busy days in the city. Living in Bedford-Stuyvesant turned out to be the most worthwhile experience of our trip. This neighborhood in transition showed us a very different and fascinating side of New York compared to the tourist/shopping experiences of Manhattan. Nichelle shares one of my favorite pleasures in life, food. She took me for a tour in Chelsea foodmarket and we had a lovely lunch. She also recommended the two nearby restaurants, Saraghina and Peaches, which quickly became our favorite spots with their wonderful atmosphere and food. We have many fond memories from our trip thanks to you Nichelle, and we would certainly like to come back![QWERTY123]Nichelle's apartment is amazing. Myself, my brother and two friends stayed in the stuydio for 3 nights in  her amazing brownstone.
Great cafes and restraunts all around. Located 10 min walk from the subway A train to manhattan. 10 min cab ride  to the awesome Brooklyn museum .
Nichelle is fantastic for a good chat and made us feel right at home. We had everything we needed and her hospitality made our stay so much more enjoyable.
If you truely want to experience the brooklyn way of life. Nichelles stuydio 2 is the place to stay!
Thankyou Nichelle[QWERTY123]5/5 stars for Nichelle and Stuydio 2! Nichelle is a lovely host, she is always available if you have any questions! The apartment is huge and clean and there is everything you need for a comfortable stay - even a washing and drying machine as well as a great bath tub which was really convenient for us as a family. The neighborhood is nice and safe so the 15 minutes walk to the A (express) train station is not a problem. There are a lot of small corner shops in this area where you can get basic supplies. We recommend this apartment to everyone, especially larger groups and families will not regret their choice!! Thank you Nichelle we will never forget our time in BedStuy and hope to be back one day.[QWERTY123]An excellent and moving experience. New York as I imagined it. With Nelly, a lot of shopping and it was again very soon ...[QWERTY123]We were a group of  five and stayed 13 straight nights between 1-14 November. Everything we have experienced at the place was exactly the same seen at the pictures and explanations. 
 
 Our host Nichelle is very kind, care taking (although nothing was needed to be taking care of) and friendly. She has reacted immediately to every questions we have asked. Sometimes even earlier...:D

 We are ultimately happy and satisfied from what we have got. Thanks to 
Nichelle and her family. We are definitely sure that next time will be with her again. 

 Best Regards,[QWERTY123]We tried Airbnb when we came to visit NYC for our son's surgery - we needed a 2 bedroom space so that we could be with him.

LOVE LOVE LOVE Nichelle's space - it was clean and exactly as pictured - 

Located in an area with lots of families and lots of pride in ownership. Lots of corner markets and a proper grocery 1/2 mile away.

The area was very easy to navigate and I enjoyed 2 morning runs thourgh the charming brownstone neighborhoods...

Nichelle was amazing - I had transaportation issues trying to get from the hospital to the apartment in the rain during shift change for cabs and she was so supportive as my check-in time moved 9 pm.  She was out of town during our visit - but was sure I knew how to get ahold of her...

Would definately do this again!!!![QWERTY123]We booked a 2 bedroom apartment and recieved an Email from Nichelle a few weeks prior to say our apartment had been double booked so she offered us her studio apartment at a discounted rate and we were happy with that. We arrived in the US and recieved another Email from Nichelle, unfortunately she had had some storm damage to the studio apartment and had to cancel our booking however she kindly offered to find us another apartment and found us a studio apartment just two blocks from her. The studio apartment we rented had just been ""set up"" for renting and there were a few minor things that were perhaps not up to scratch (no iron, ironing board, toaster, coffee cups, the TV didn't work very well for the first 3 (Website hidden by Airbnb) name a few). However our host Niamah was lovely and very accommodating (bringing us cups and party favours for New Years Eve) and Nichelle did EVERYTHING she could to help us and make our stay pleasant....Thanks Niamah and Nichelle for all your help.[QWERTY123]Energetic host, and her sons are adorable. Even though it was hard to enter the room due to stairs, once entering, it was so comfortable and I felt it was just like my place.
The studio was spacious, and kitchen was well equipped. Also, there is a window on the ceiling, and sunshine from the window was so great. 
Highly recommended!![QWERTY123]True to the pictures. The apartment was great and spacious enough for a group of people. Shelly, the host, was very flexible with our schedules and easy to communicate with. Overall, great experience!![QWERTY123]This was my first time using AirBnB! I spent a weekend here with a few of my friends and it was really nice! Nichelle is really accommodating and funny. The place is clean and adorably decorated. Just like the pictures!
I would definitely recommend this place to others.[QWERTY123]Our group of 4 spent three nights here and we loved it! 

Nichelle is a friendly host who made us feel welcome (say hello to her twin boys - they're absolutely adorable and so polite too!) and gave us some great suggestions on where to go and what to eat! She also made herself available to us, so whenever we needed help or had a question, we could always text her! 

The apartment was spacious, clean, and well-lit.  Highly recommended![QWERTY123]Extremely nice host and really great neighbourhood. We had a great time and would certainly go back in the future.[QWERTY123]We loved staying in this apartment in Brooklyn. The express train to Manhattan is handy and there are plenty of neighborhood spots to eat and hang out. The apartment is great. Plenty of room. Very clean. Nichelle is outstanding. Can't recommend this place enough.[QWERTY123]We really enjoyed our stay in Nichelles wonderful appartment! It was quiet, large enough for us 4 and really like a ""home"" during our days in NY! Everything You need you'll find in the very charming studyio - even a washing machine and free wifi! A little hint for the arrival - we found the best place to get the first food and stuff to get started, was the key food supermarket at broadway-about half a mile away. Just a short walk and you get everything you need (a bit more than in the groceries at the corner) :o) We had a great time and will definitely come back and tell all of our friends of this perfect place to stay.[QWERTY123]A very honest deal and definitely worth the price!.  Some small details limit our appreciation to 4 stars; a missing curtain in one of the front bedroom window (there is a street  light nearby), an unsteady sofa, no dishcloth, no hook in the bathroom. Would have appreciated a few glasses for the wine. All apparels (kitchen and laundry) are good quality and work well. Nichelle is kind (her kids friendly) and the neighborhood is well maintained. We came by car and could leave it almost in front of the house all day long (free!). Two subway stations nearby: a local one at 600 meters and the express at a little over 1000 meters. This is a place where we would return.[QWERTY123]Nous etions deux couples en visite pour NY pour une semaine.
Une tres jolie petite maison ... l appart est bien situé. c est un jolie quartier. 
Cordialement Michel B.

[QWERTY123]Nichelle was very friendly and gave us a lot of information about everything we needed in the apartment, neighborhood and city.

The apartment was clean and big as explained and shown in the description and photos.  10 minutes walk from the subway station to Manhattan.

The value we got for what we paid was high and we do recommend this apartment.[QWERTY123]Very nice apartment and friendly, helpful people. Metro just some blocks away. During our stay we didnt miss anything and felt like home.[QWERTY123]Vacanza perfetta, Nichelle è stata utile e sempre disponibile, la casa è vicina a tutti i servizi ed in un'ottima zona. Consigliato.[QWERTY123]I have used Air BnB for several years...but never with my family. Six of us stayed @ Nichelle's, 3 children and 3 adults. What a great time! 
The location is tremendous... walking didstance  to the subway, resturants and stores.
 The kids had all day to be out and see the sights. Then they could come ""home"" to a real place instead of a hotel room. They had a beautiful neighborhood to play in, and plenty of space to be themselves. They were making friends the first evening there.
 It was a tremendous money saver for us as we had lunch out and when the kids got tired, we came home, had dinner and got ready for bed! Then, their folks were still close enough to run back into Manhatten and enjoy an evening out while Grandma stayed home to babysit!
 Nichelle is a wonderful hostess...avaliable when needed but not obtrusive. She has a notebook with suggestions, maps, etc in the apartment for general use. She is also able to answer questions when you need help.
 This was a great experience and we plan to return in the future![QWERTY123]This apartment was delightful.  It was clean and comfortable and had everything we needed.  We actually were out more than in the apartment but it was nice to come home to at night.  I wouldn't recommend staying in the summer as we did.  There are air conditioners in the bedrooms but the main room gets pretty warm.[QWERTY123]Très chouette appartement, grand, très propre, confortable à tous niveaux. Nous étions 2 adultes et 3 ados. Quartier très calme et agréable, à une demi heure de Manhattan ! Très bel accueil de la très dynamique et organisée Nichelle ! Ideal de quitter le vacarme de Big Apple et se retrouver au calme dans la maison de Nichelle ! Chaleur accablante dehors mais air conditionné à l'intérieur ! Parfait ! Nous n'hésiterons pas à communiquer cette adresse à tous nos amis et si nous revenons à New York, c'est sûr que nous reviendrons ici !

juillet 2012[QWERTY123]Nichelle was a very nice and informative host. Always a text away.  I mjust admit that I was a little skeptical when we first drove up to the neighborhood, but the people were actually very friendly and helpful.  The place was clean and comfortable.  We actually saved some money by having a couple of meals at home.

Thanks,
Nichelle[QWERTY123]Nice & clean place to stay.  Walk to subway is relative.  Its a little more than half a mile walk to the subway which was no big deal for me but was little too long for my parents to do on a regular basis since we were always heading over to Manhattan.  From looking at a map it looks like it is a lot closer than .6 of a mile.  Nichelle is great! Really helpful! Local places to eat have good food.[QWERTY123]I am concerned that our experience was so different to the people who left reviews.
Shelly and her husbadnd Kirk were delightful and helpful people and they did their best to make us comfortable and welcome. On occasions beyond the call of duty.

Then there are the beds, which we found frankly uncomfortable, I mentioned this and to be fair Shelly did buy a topper which helped.
Finally there is the question of ventilation. The central room, even witha cyclone fan was very very hot and would have been worse if we had come the week before when the temperatures were even higher. It has no windows or ventilation, but has a glass skylight dome which radiates heat from the sun in summer.
There is noisy air con in the bed rooms which makes sleeping bearable but noisy.
So a mixed stay. In all I think we thought it was good value for money, a lot of house for the money  and my gripe is with the Airbnb community who have not been totally frank in their reviews. If they had been we would have made our decision and not felt miffed.
I made some suggestions to Shelly on how to make improvements.

If the area the beds and the ventilation are not a problem for you I would recommend the place. Would I stay again? Only if i was really short of money. Am I sorry that Shelly and Kirk might feel insulted by my review? Yes, becuase they are really nice people.[QWERTY123]One word for my stay... PERFECT. Shelly was amazing, extremely accommodating, and went above and beyond to make my stay comfortable. From being patient during my late arrival, to making sure I had everything I needed... to pointing me in the right direction for the closest wine store! :) And then to top it off, I was able to extend my stay by 3 days with no hassle or issues. It was just perfect perfect perfect for what I needed. The apartment itself is very clean, quiet and peaceful. The bathroom is the (Website hidden by Airbnb) Took a relaxing bath almost each night of my stay. It was the perfect environment for me.. I needed to work with no distractions. Strong internet connection, cable, and AC kept it nice and cool. The apartment had towels, clean bedding and kitchen necessities. I would definitely come back and recommend this place to others! (However i'm trying to figure out a grand master plan to persuade Shelly to rent me the apartment for good!) LOL Its just that great![QWERTY123]Nichelle was a great hostess and we were soo close to the subway that it was fine not paying the high prices in Manhattan.  The neighborhood was quiet which was great after long days touring NY.  The recommended local eating places were awesome as well.  Before checking in we ate at a pizzeria called seraphina which was awesome and also came highly recommended by Nichelle.  We also ate at Peaches and it was awesome.  Thanks Nichelle, we will definitely stay there again on our next journey to New York.[QWERTY123]The reservation was canceled 67 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.[QWERTY123]hola
  hemos estado muy a gusto en casa de Nichelle, ha cuidado de nosotros facilitandonos la estancia, el barrio es muy agradable y nada turístico, pilla un poco lejos de Manhattan, aunque eso va a gustos.
De todas formas hay un metro directo.
Lo recomedamos[QWERTY123]The reservation was canceled 175 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.[QWERTY123]L'appartement est aussi grand que sur les photos. Il est idéal pour se reposer après une journée shopping, mais pour les casaniers, on s'ennuie vite.
Au départ, on a l'impression que c'est un quartier craingnos, mais au final, on a pas eu de problème. Il suffit de faire attention et d'être discret.
Nous avons reçu un accueil chaleureux; Nichelle est amicale, énergique, prête à nous aider.
Appartement recommandé pour les groupes d'amis ou/et en famille.
Merci pour ce beau séjour.[QWERTY123]Wir haben erst zu viert dann zu fünft bei Nichelle gewohnt, insgesamt für etwas über ein halbes Jahr, da wir ein Auslandssemester in New York gemacht haben. Nichelle hat uns sehr herzlich willkommen geheißen und wir haben uns in Brooklyn rundum wohl gefühlt. Die Wohnung ist relativ groß und für 4 Leute perfekt, aber auch mit 6 machbar. Da wir über den Sommer da waren, wird es manchmal ein bisschen warm, aber in New York sollte man seine Zeit eh nicht in der Wohnung verbringen ;) Zur Subway läuft man ca. 10 Minuten und fährt dann direkt nach Manhattan rein, also sehr gut angebunden. 
Wir können das Wohnen bei Nichelle absolut empfehlen und haben es sehr genossen![QWERTY123]We were 4 people staying for 10 days in Nichelles apartment. The place is nice and welcoming. The bedrooms are very big and perfect for couples. There is even a closet where you can store your items. Also the kitchen is well equipped if you want to cook. 
We even got some supplies for our stay (e.g map of manhatten, some fruits, shower gel). 
The subway station is ~15minutes away from the apartment and the ride to manhatten is about 30 minutes. 
Whenever we had questions Nichelle responded within minutes and was happy to help out. Perfect host!

Thanks again Nichelle for a pleasant stay in Brooklyn :)
-Sarah[QWERTY123]Nous avons passé un agréable séjour dans cet appartement sur Brooklyn ! Nous étions deux couples d'amis. 

Accueil chaleureux et sympa de Nichelle. Elle a été très réactive et à l'écoute à chaque fois que nous en avions besoin. 

Appartement fonctionnel et conforme à l'annonce et aux photos. Bien situé à 5-10 minutes du métro C ou A. 

Une bonne adresse pour se reposer après de longues journées de découvertes et visites de NY, à un prix raisonnable.

Merci Nichelle !![QWERTY123]Shelly was extremely timely. As I was looking for a place to stay, she responded quickly to all my questions and concerns. The place actually had more beds in it than expected, which only made the stay better. The place looked and smelled fresh and clean when we arrived. She was easy to communicate with via email and cell phone. She had foreign guests leaving from her lower apartment, and she clearly had taken great care of them for their entire stay. They were very adamant about being able to say a warm goodbye to her. Something that really stood out was how she really wanted to make sure their entire experience was valuable. She went out of her way to make sure the taxi company brought a nice vehicle to take them to the apartment. Overall, it was a solid experience.[QWERTY123]We had 5 adults and 3 kids staying at Nichelle's place and felt very comfortable.  The space is very spacious.

Parking was a bit of a hassle.  It was hard to find a space and had to move the car early in the morning due to cleaning on the street.[QWERTY123]A great place to stay, with a very helpful and lovely host. I can recommend this apartment if you want to visit N. Y. The subway takes you to Manhattan in about 20 minutes, but the walk to the subway is approximately 8-10 minutes.
We came in a car and had no problem to find a parkingspot in the street.[QWERTY123]Shelly was an energetic and excellent host, always available to give us good ideas and for helping us in so many ways ! The appartmemt was perfect : clean, sunny,  very well equipped, located close to subway station...I highly recommend this place[QWERTY123]Nous avons passé une superbe semaine à New-York et nous tenons à remercier Nichelle pour son accueil très amicale malgré notre arrivée tardive. L'appartement est très spacieux, très propre et agréable et très bien situé à environ 30 minutes de Manhattan. Encore merci pour la très bonne humeur et la joie communicative de Nichelle. Nous espérons revenir pour un prochain séjour à New-York.[QWERTY123]She greeted us and was very nice and easily accessible![QWERTY123]Nichelle was very helpful and accommodating with our checkin and arrival time. 
The apartment  was very clean, nicely decorated and conveniently distributed with 2 bedrooms on either end and the common area in between. 
The only thing keeping this from a 5 star rating can be easily fixed, comfort. The beds could have been a bit more comfortable. 
Other than that the apartment was fantastic.[QWERTY123]We really loved the Nichelle's appartement.
The apt was very clean, and enough confortable for 6 peoples.
The apt is well located too, with great amenities, and the neibourghood is very safe and friendly.

Nichelle was perfect too, very helpful, full of advices, a real authentic person. Thx again Nichelle :)

I'd not hesitate to book it again for our next nyc trip.

Hakim[QWERTY123]We had a lovely stay in Brooklyn. Shelly was an amazingly welcoming host and gave us lots of helpful advice during the stay. The apartment was spacious and homely with the subways within 10 min walking distance.[QWERTY123]We would like to thank Nichelle for being such wonderful and helpful host. She was always available for questions and responded promptly. The apartment was clean and exactly as pictured. The location is great with close proximity to subway and many restaurants and stores nearby. We enjoyed our staying and highly recommend Nichelle as a host. We will stay there again.[QWERTY123]Nichelle est une hôte très sympathique et accueillante. Elle est de très bon conseil pour les indications sur les trajets en métro et la découverte pratique de son quartier. Son logement est nickel, tout y est pour passer un bon séjour. Les différents commerces à proximité complètent le tout.

Nous y reviendrons bien volontiers pour un prochain séjour.[QWERTY123]We had a very pleasant stay at the apartment which was clean and spacious. Nichelle has also kindly offered great tips on food and sight-seeing locations. It was a delightful experience overall.[QWERTY123]Nichelle was the KINDEST host imaginable. Upon arrival, the apartment was extremely clean and tidy, along with being stocked with some cleaning products, fresh linen (extras if needed), body wash, almost all you could imagine. Whenever we needed Chelly, she would respond very speedy. This was such a pleasant stay and I would recommend staying with Nichelle to ANYONE. 

Not only is Nichelle an amazing host, she is an amazing woman with vast charisma. (She also has the sweetest and most polite kids)! I really enjoyed my stay.[QWERTY123]The host canceled this reservation 68 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.[QWERTY123]Great experience in typical Brooklyn neighborhood[QWERTY123]Nichelle è molto gentile e ha saputo darci buone indicazioni. La casa è spazioso, molto pulita con tutto l'occorrente.
Il quartiere è tranquillo e non abbiamo avuto nessun problema neanche la sera. Ben servito dalla metropolitana (che si raggiunge con una camminata di 10 minuti) che arriva direttamente a Mahattan. Il viaggio non è breve e, a seconda di dove si vuole andare, ci vogliono almeno 30/40 minuti e, soprattutto in certi orari, le vetture non sono molto frequenti. 
Letti molto comodi anche se facevano molto rumore quando ci si muoveva, forse perché nei materassi c'era ancora la plastica. Camere silenziose.
Unico neo: eravamo in 6 e c'erano solo 4 sedie, quindi, per mangiare abbiamo dovuto arrangiarci in qualche modo![QWERTY123]Mes amis m ont dit que Nichelle est tres gentille et accueillante,l appartement est tres prope et bien situe .Alors ils le recommandent à tout ceux qui vont à Brooklyn[QWERTY123]The host canceled this reservation 8 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.[QWERTY123]We had a wonderful time here. The apartment was clean, spacious and equipped with everything we needed. It is in a great location and only a short walk from the subway. Shelly was a great host, very friendly and gave good advice and recommendations of things to do.[QWERTY123]We enjoyed our stay in New York City. Nichelle was very welcoming. She helped us when we needed. The apartment is spacious and near from the subway, 10 minutes walking. The bedrooms contain two beds each other. We will come back in this flat with pleasure.
Thank you for all Nichelle.[QWERTY123]Nichelle's place is beautiful and she is soo accommodating. Easy to access transportation, well stocked, will book again each visit! 

Thank you Nicole for hosting my parents; they loved it![QWERTY123]La estancia fue muy correcta. Nichelle estuvo en la casa para nuestra llegada al apartamento. 
Lo único que no me gusto es que tuvimos que salir apresuradamente del apartamento y al pedir dejar las maletas puesto q nuestro vuelo salía tarde de NY nos comunicaron que debíamos pagar por tenerlas allí solo unas horas. Eso me decepciono bastante,después de haber estado 10 días y pagar por ellos.
[QWERTY123]Nichelle was an excellent host. Always very proactive, she was quick to respond, whenever needed.
 
The apartment is comfortable and was in good condition.

[QWERTY123]Nichelle is very warm welcoming as soon as you step threw the door, she help guide me step by step on my  arrival to her home which I appreciated soooo much. Also traveling in the hot weather it was nice to arrive at a her home fully air conditioned also she show me how to have access to her WiFi which is big for travelers. Over all if your looking for a home away from home then nichelle home is your spot.[QWERTY123]Shelly was such a great host, and her place was awesome. Very bight, spacious, and clean. Would highly recommend and would not hesitate to book again![QWERTY123]Shelly was such a great host and her place was a home away from home. Very bight, spacious and homey. Price is good. Would highly recommend and would not hesitate to book again![QWERTY123]This space was great for a group accommodation.  The location was perfect and the neighborhood was very welcoming.  Nichelle was a great host very she was helpful in all areas, she even had suggested restaurants and activities we should try.  Highly recommended listing.[QWERTY123]Nichelle's flat is very convenient and it is large enough for 5 persons. We spent à very nice week there.
The flat is few minutes away from the Utica Avenue station (A or C train) and it takes 20 minutes to go to Manhattan.
Nichelle's welcome was great: She took the time to show us the neighbourood and to make sure that everything was OK for us.
The next time we will go back to NYC, we will return to Nichelle's flat without any hésitation.
Olivier, Muriel, Clémence, Louise and Sophie from France.[QWERTY123]The host canceled this reservation 39 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.[QWERTY123]I enjoyed my stay at Nichelle's! To start it off, she was a friendly host who was more than willing to show about the neighbourhood. I seriously love dining at Manny's which was really near her place. The apartment was also big and spacious, really great for a family of for a group of friends! I would definitely put up here again if there's the chance. Nichelle also turned on the air-conditioning for us so it was cool when we got back home at night because the weather was really hot.[QWERTY123]The location of the apartment is simply perfect to go and visit the city. The room was comfortable and had all the basics that were needed. It was unbeatable for the price Nichelle was a great host, she had the place prepared for us and gave us a couple of maps and some tips where to go, eat, have a drink, etc, she was always available if we needed anything. It's safe to walk around and the people are friendly.
I enthusiastically recommend Nichelle!
[QWERTY123]all in all a nice apartment. good space. nothing really to do around the neighborhood. the subway is about 15 minutes walk. Manhattan is about 30 minutes ride. nichelle's friend came to let us in.  she was nice and gave us some recommendations.  we didn't see nichelle the whole time until the check out. our flight back home was only at 6pm.  check out was at 11 am, she let us stay until 12 , and then we had to wait in the street for a taxi.   we had a mouse in the apartment.[QWERTY123]For my first Airbnb experience I must say, I am 100% satisfied with my stay at Nichelle's place. The location was beautiful, very home-like, safe neighborhood, convenient across from the place, an awesome brunch location called Peaches that the host recommended. All of the beds were comfortable, had AC, and were very spacious. The host was easy to contact, very understanding of all the difficulties my group experience. Overall, Nichelle's place and hospitality was a grade A example of what a home away from home should be. Thanks so much, you will definitely be seeing us again soon![QWERTY123]Smoke detector peeping which means not maintained and one was missing with exposed wires hanging from ceiling. Apartment not cleaned - cleaner admitted she hadn't cleaned before we arrived - dirty tissues around entry and bedroom. Kitchen sink drain blocked with plant debris. inappropriate makedo  aircon with plastic hose coming through window that was taped with broken plastic sheeting taped up with duct tape. Day sofa bed was stained and needed cleaning Have stayed at 4 airbnb's this trip & this apartment has not meet the normally expected airbnb standard 
[QWERTY123]We definetly can recommend Shellys home for a stay in New York! :) It was one of our first Airbnb experiences  (the first we booked - the second we did). 

The Host: Shelly did everything making our stay as comfortable as possible! Espacially answering all of our questions, and we also had a lot of stupid questions cause of the missing Airbnb experience :D She is a lovelly host who has a lot tips, she took Restaurant reservation for us, showed us helpful Websites for getting NFL Tickets and finding Rooftop Bars! Two days before arrivel we asked her to come a day earlier which was no problem just as stay one Night longer! You can ask her everything you want and she will try to help you. She replies quickly to messages.

The Apartment: is really like in the description. When we arrived it smelled really good, like flowers. It was clear that the Apartment was cleared. It is a cozy Apartment with 2 bedrooms - 2 beds in each of them. We've been a group of 5 and had more than enough space. The kitchen includes everything you need for cooking, like spices, oil etc. We spend 6 Nights in our home away from home. There is also a lot of helpful Information in the home, like Subway Maps etc.

Parking: if you're coming with an car, like us, you have to find a parking space at the street. There are two days with 1 1/2 hour for cleaning the street for each side  ( Mo/Thu the one Side and Tue/Fri the other each from 9-10:30) During this time you're not allowed to park at the related Side, so you have to change. Parking is free.

Neighborhood: Brooklyn and the streets next to the apartment is a pleasant area. You'll find some Bars, Restaurants, groceries and a supermarked. We often came home after midnight and didn't felt uncomfortable on the way from Subway to the Apartment.

Subway: The next Subway Station (Utica A (Website hidden by Airbnb) Train) is about 15min by feet which is really ok. The Subway needs about 25-35 min (depends on the Train you take -  Express stops at less Stations than the local) to Downtown where you find all the things most New York Tourists want to see.

We definetly would choose Shelly's House again the next time we're coming to NYC. It made our stay so comfortable and easy! thanks a lot for all your help Shelly! Hope we've been pleasant guests! We wish you a enjoyable free week with an awesome birthday ;)

Kind regards,

Jesko, Mareike, Isabell, Volker, Sabine[QWERTY123]Our host personally welcomed us upon our arrival and took the time to show us around the apartment. She provided us with guides that would help us get around the city (we are not from NY, so this was super helpful!), and gave us great recommendations for nearby places to eat! The rooms and apartment were just as described, and the temperature was perfect. Beds were comfortable, and the rooms were spacious enough for us. The host provided us with privacy and space throughout our stay as well. Being 1st time airbnb members, we all agreed that  staying at Shelly's apartment during our trip was a much better experience than staying at a hotel. We will definitely come back and have Shelly's apartment as our 1st choice place to stay when we visit NY once again :)[QWERTY123]Shelly was an excellent host.  She greeted us when we arrived and gave us a quick overview of the apartment.  She was available during our stay to answer questions.  The apartment was very close to two subway lines which made travel into Manhattan very easy.[QWERTY123]Nichelle's apartment served as a great base for us to visit family and the sites in NYC. We also had a chance to stay in more of a neighborhood, family setting in Brooklyn. Nichelle was a great host and the apt. offered ample space for our family. This is an especially good option for those looking for a change of pace from Manhattan.[QWERTY123]Nichelle is a terrific host, and her place is great -- really clean, well-cared-for and in a great New York neighborhood. We had a great time and really enjoyed her tips about the neighborhood. Can't wait to come back.[QWERTY123]When we stepped out of the Utica subway we were very dubious as to what sort of area we had reserved our stay. However we soon realized that BedStuy is a genuine Brooklyn area and is a wonderful place up come back too after a day in Manhatten. Count a ten minute walk and then a 20-35 minute subway into Manhatten.
The appartement was perfect for a family of four although poorly insulated. I'm sure the holes around the window could be easily fixed?
Everything was clean, the beds very comfy and we had lots of space. We cooked in a couple of evenings in an adequately equipped kitchen. Dining out us great at Mannys around the corner.
Nichelle is very welcoming and we highly recommend her appartment[QWERTY123]The host canceled this reservation 13 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.[QWERTY123]Nichelle was very accommodating as we requested to book an hour before! Thank you so much. The place is extremely spacious and a great neighborhood. I would definitely suggest this place and stay here again! 
Thanks again Nichelle for your hospitality![QWERTY123]My friends and I rented Shelly's place for one night for our Friendsgiving get together. The pictures very accurately portrays the space and it was very spacious for the 5 of us. The airbnb was also very clean. The wifi was fast and there was Netflix on the TV. Shelly lives downstairs and was available when we needed anything from her. The location is close to the subway and the neighborhood itself is pretty quiet. Check in and check out was also very easy and convenient. Overall, we really enjoyed our time at Shelly's airbnb and would recommend it to big groups or families.[QWERTY123]The host canceled this reservation 6 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.[QWERTY123]Le logement est assez spacieux mais les fenêtres laissent pénétrer l'air froid. Les ustensiles de cuisine  ne sont pas suffisants et la vaisselle non plus.
Nichelle est sympa et disponible, prête à régler le moindre souci.[QWERTY123]My family truly enjoyed their stay at Shelly's home in bed stuy. My elders were felt safe in the area and walked around quite often. They walked to Manny's for coffee and pastries before starting the day. Than came back for dinner at Saraghina in the same area. Several food shops and essential stores are close which saved a trip downtown. Did the usual venture of going to time square and showing my folks around. Shelly gave us several highlights of the city to check out which we were grateful for. If your ever in the city and need a place for family I recommend it.
[QWERTY123]My family and I had an wonderful time at Shelly's Place.  The apartment was spacious and well kept. The washer and dryer was  a HUGE perk! 
The neighborhood is nice with a few places to eat, we loved Chez Oscar and the coffee shop right down the street. 
There was a grocery store within a walking distance. 
The subway was about a 10 min. Walk. 
Shelly provided a subway map and her guide was helpful. 
*Bring good shoes you will walk a lot in NY. 
We will certainly come back and stay at Shelly's again![QWERTY123]We had a wonderful stay here. The unit is exactly as advertised. Subway stops are close, the ride into the city is convenient, and it's a great value. The layout was perfect for me and my daughters on their spring break trip to NYC. Our host responded to our questions in a very timely matter and was flexible with the schedule. I would definitely recommend this unit to future travelers.[QWERTY123]Shelly was awesome. Her place in the heart of Brooklyn made my family and I feel right at home! 

 Shelly came to check on us and make sure we were as comfortable as possible. Her place being centrally located made getting around NY very easy.[QWERTY123]I had my brothers in visiting, and it being Brooklyn, of course I don't have room to put them up myself! We stayed here and it was the perfect place to land. More spacious than we needed, beautiful Brooklyn block, great communication. Keeping this place in mind for next time.[QWERTY123]Although I wasn't able to meet Shelly during our stay due to her being out of town for work, she was still incredibly friendly, considerate, helpful, and kept in close contact to see if everything was running smoothly or if we needed anything during our stay. The apartment was huge and had more than what we needed for our stay! It was very homey and comfortable. The street that we were on was very cute and the neighbors were beyond friendly! The bus stop is right across the street that can take you to the subway within just a few minutes which was awesome! Shelly also provides maps and pointers for getting around the city which were very helpful and we appreciated it a ton! We will definitely be back in the winter :)[QWERTY123]Gastgeberin Shelly ist immer erreichbar und um das Wohlbefinden ihrer Gäste bemüht.[QWERTY123]This is a good place, while it's a little hard to find the key at first, after all, it's worth to stay and Shelly is very nice[QWERTY123]A really nice place to stay - in a very picturesque and lush neighborhood, but still with a very good beer bar (Wilkes) and a couple off really nice restaurants close by. It's spacious with all amenities one could wish for and the nice neighbor at hand if any questions should arise. Very recommended![QWERTY123]A good house.  Beautiful and spacious place. Excellent beds. T apartament has all[QWERTY123]The host canceled this reservation 24 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.[QWERTY123]We loved staying at Shelly's beautiful and comfortable place. The neighborhood was friendly and safe. We were close to transportation and some wonderful restaurants. Groceries within a block. We will definitely stay there again![QWERTY123]Nice room,nice householder,nice neighbor,easy to Manhattan by subway.Shelly offen give me many useful information on time.That is a good trip,maybe I will come here next time.[QWERTY123]V[QWERTY123]Shelly's apartment is clean, well-maintained, and she goes above and beyond to make sure guests are comfortable and have all questions answered. I especially appreciated the abundance of good restaurants nearby and Shelly's recommendation on places to try. I would suggest that guests bring a WiFi hotspot and/or a laptop if they plan on watching Netflix, as the smart TV in the apartment was unable to play any TV or movies on the apartment's WiFi signal. Other than that, the place is great, and I would very likely stay there again.[QWERTY123]Very beautiful place to live in! Not huge space but enough for a family of 5 or even 6. Convenient location with warm and quiet neighbors.[QWERTY123]Shelly's place is located on a beautiful Bed Stuy block and features some wonderful amenities for your stay. We had a wonderful stay in this home. Thank you![QWERTY123]logement bien situé, proche des transports, deux lignes proche manhattan
confortable pour une famille de 6[QWERTY123]Good place and location[QWERTY123]Shelly,

Thank you so much for being a great host. We had great time in New York. Your place is in great location, clean, quiet and comfortable. Every night we are able to have a good rest after a long day of walking. And you will always help us when we have any question.

I will definitely recommend this place to my friends.

Lei[QWERTY123]We really enjoyed our stay at the appartment! The appartment have enough space for 3 people easily! Very clean, close to the subway![QWERTY123]Shelly was an amazing host. She had great communication with us prior and during our trip. The unit was exactly as described and the house looks like it does in pictures. One the of best things about this place is that there is an AC machine or fan in each room which was a life saver on the days it was hot. The house is also close to many different subway station which was very convenient. The only con was that the house wasn't ready at check in because the cleaning lady went somewhere but the housemate was nice enough to finish the cleaning so we could get settled in. There also wasn't a sponge to wash the dishes so we had to go buy one as well. Other than that, our stay was great![QWERTY123]This is a very roomy apartment in a residential neighborhood. It was a lovely refuge after busy days in the city.[QWERTY123]Is a excellent option for big groups of people.. the apartment is comfortable.. the location is close the subway and the neighborhood is great!
The Shelly support is important and she keep in touch all the time.
Tks again Shelly!
For the travelers, you should try this Airbnb and enjoy NYC..[QWERTY123]Wonderful place, clean, spacious, just what you need. If you come driving to NY, this is your place. The neighborhood is great with lots of restaurants nearby. It is 3 blocks away from C (blue) subway line, 15 minutes to downtown Manhattan about 45 to Central Park. Thumbs up!!!![QWERTY123]Appartement fonctionnel et à coté du métro ![QWERTY123]It was a great trip in NYC with a good appartment. Everything you need are already here, just bring your suitcase !

The appartment was clean and very equipped. Shelly gave us a lot of advice and responds quickly to any requests ![QWERTY123]Very clean & very helpful. I didn’t have any complaints[QWERTY123]The place was really spacious and clean when my friends and I entered. We were all amazed by the place that we were staying at and was already welcomed by the neighbors downstairs.
Walking to the subway station is about 10 minutes, there are many convenient stores in the area, grocery stores, as well as a fried chicken place for last second meal.[QWERTY123]Shelly´s apartment was better than we expected. As per pictures that were attached to the post, the apartment was bigger than we thought and perfect for big groups.

The only aspect to take into account was that, even though it was good for big groups, there were not enough plates, toilet paper and chairs for the 7 of us.

For the rest, we were really comfortable as it was freezing in NY and the heating was very nice when arriving home as well as the bedrooms have space for your clothes.

In general, very recommendable for people visiting NY as it is very well connected via underground, only 7 min waking from the apartment. Definitely convenient for big groups![QWERTY123]It's always a pleasure to stay at Shellys house whenever my family and I come to Brooklyn. At this point is like staying at an old friends home. Close proximity to the trains, awesome local fare and restaurants. No complaints whatsoever![QWERTY123]丁寧な対応､きれいな部屋を用意してくれて心から感謝しています｡[QWERTY123]I didn't get a chance to meet Shelly but my friends did and we think it was really nice of her to drop by and meet us. 

Shelly was very proactive in keeping us posted around the way about, commuting, places to eat, groceries, etc. The flat is completely equipped (with all basic amenities) for a family or long stay. The flat even has a few books to use for tourism in the city. 
In terms of location you are away from the hustle bustle and in midst of the locals which was a good experience. There are 2 sibway stations within 10 to 15 mins walks from the flat that get in you into Manhattan & Brooklyn Bridge.

Also we had a small change in our situation and Shelly was very kind in accommodating a late check out.

I thoroughly recommend the place.[QWERTY123]The host canceled this reservation 20 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.[QWERTY123]Shelley is a very responsive host with a great property. We really enjoyed staying here![QWERTY123]Shelly was very welcoming and gave us tips for nice places in Brooklyn. Great place to stay.  House very close to the subway station.[QWERTY123]To future guests: this Airbnb is of historical importance, a piece of all of our history! In order to preserve this value for further generations please treat this place with respect.  
Shelly was away so we never got a chance to introduce ourselves. However, others in the building were aware of our presence which made me feel not only at home but safe. Additionally, she kept in contact promptly answering three of our emails. As a result of Shelly’s attention to traveler needs we will not need to over-pack the next time we visit. The space is impressively big, spread out, quiet, clean according to my ocd standards, linens fresh, towels extra large, hot water never ran out, detailed instructions on subway location lines. The neighborhood is welcoming,  up and coming. Shelly also provided quick healthy markets/cafes with detailed directions in the area. By far the best stay on Air bnb. Easy detailed check in/checkout instructions. TY~✌️❤️Cecelia[QWERTY123]Here’s what i would want to know:  the place is on a quaint brooklyn Street full of brownstones, and trees that arch over the street.  Very picturesque and typical NYC.  Nice deli on the corner to the right, across the street, with delicious coffee and some healthy options.  If u travel to the train station u go through a neighborhood that feels unsafe.  
The inside was adequately clean.  The beds were ok if u like really firm mattresses.  No central ac but there are units in the bedrooms.  Curtains in bedrooms were sheer so sleeping in is only an option if u bring a sleep mask.  

One bathroom, clean.  The place is dated, the floors squeak, but it’s a good value for the area, in my opinion.[QWERTY123]The host canceled this reservation 2 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.[QWERTY123]Shelly place was very comfortable and homey with all amenities needed to feel at home. Shelly went way above and beyond with any questions we had in regard to Thursday and how to travel about the city safely and enjoy your visit. Would highly recommend her apartment for future guess and would definitely return in the future. Thank you Shelly"	40.683731618345774	-73.92376888978245	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/25235	7	125.0	0.8

Really quiet and safe environment with a lot of nice coffees, restaurants, bars and young people. Abdul is a great host, he answer all of our questions and recommended fun things to do. We will definitly return to Abdul's place. Thank you for the perfect trip!!![QWERTY123]I had an amazing experience at Abdul's wonderful apartment . I can only describe it as a five star experience. Abdul is an excellent friendly and accommodating host and was very helpful with information and advice . The apartment is delightful , stylish & comfortable in a superb location . I will definitely return on future visits and highly recommend to anyone heading to New York , Brooklyn has so much to offer and Abdul's apartment is close to the subway for exploring . There are numerous excellent restaurants and bars less than a stone's throw from the property. An unbeatable location in the nicest part of Brooklyn close to the park also.[QWERTY123]Abdul was very communicative leading up to our trip, answering emails and texts whenever we had questions. He met us upon arrival and even helped us with our luggage. Throughout our stay he remained in touch and even emptied the trash for us. He was very gracious and accommodating, we really enjoyed staying at his clean and spacious apartment, located in a lovely convenient neighborhood with many nice shops nearby. Thank you for making our NY trip such a pleasant one, Abdul![QWERTY123]This was exactly what we hoped for. The area is family friendly, mostly residential, with good restaurants and coffee shops nearby. Being one block away from Prospect Park is great. Highly recommended. Abdul has a wonderful and convenient apartment.[QWERTY123]The host canceled this reservation 19 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.[QWERTY123]Abdul was an excellent host. Everything was just as he described. Great location with lots of food options close by. Will definitely stay here again.[QWERTY123]Abdul was a very nice and accommodating host. The bedroom was a little loud at night, as it is right on a corner intersection - not a dealbreaker but something to keep in mind if you are a light sleeper.[QWERTY123]Nice apartment in a great location.  Good communication from host.  There is some traffic noise, so earplugs can help with sleep.[QWERTY123]Abdul's place is clean, big, and in a fantastic location. Quiet building with tons of bars/restaurants/businesses in easy walking distance. It's a great spot.[QWERTY123]Abdul's place is perfectly located, one block away from Prospect Park, two blocks from the subway and surrounded by charming tree-lined streets, great restaurants, neighborhood stores and bars. The apartment is filled with cool and soulful art and colorful walls. It's super stylish while remaining comfortable - a perfect combination in my opinion. Abdul was wonderfully responsive and generously accommodated a late check-out. I'd move in in a heartbeat and I look forward to coming back. Don't miss out on Prospect Park, BTW. It takes 4 minutes to walk to the famous ""meadow"" where you suddenly feel like you're in the countryside. It's a slice of heaven in the big city."	40.66277874790975	-73.97966003099255	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/12299	2	120.0	0.733333
88	12303	"Yolande-a most gracious host. Great flat and location.

[QWERTY123]La casa di Yolande è molto piacevole e confortevole. Lei è una persona estramamente disceta e rispettosa dela privacy. Il mio soggiorno come ospite è stato ottimo.[QWERTY123]Bellissima esperienza casa stupenda e pulita[QWERTY123]Very obliging host and a great place to stay - apartment and location.[QWERTY123]I absolutely loved Yolande's apartment and the neighborhood. The apartment is spacious, clean and beautiful. The room and bathroom are very comfortable. The neighborhood - Fort Greene - is my new favorite in New York. Full of restaurants, shops (quite a few organic supermarkets!), brownstones, parks and well connected to Manhattan. Yolande is a wonderful host, her presence being both comforting and discreet. Her great taste makes this apartment very suited for architecture and design lovers. I highly recommend it![QWERTY123]Perfect host, perfect place to call home whilst in Brooklyn. Yolande is one of those people you feel like you've met before. She has created a beautiful home, I really enjoyed my stay. Fort Greene is a great neighbourhood, with an abundance of cool cafe's, bars and restaurants. I highly recommend booking Yolande's place if you have the opportunity.[QWERTY123]Wonderful place in a great part of Fort Greene. Yolande is a very gracious host and her skill as a stylist is present in the aesthetic and atmosphere of the apartment, with every square inch thoughtfully furnished. Our paths rarely crossed as we were both out much of the time, but she was very helpful when I asked for information. Would highly recommend her apartment to those heading to NYC.[QWERTY123]Yolande's place was gorgeous, clean, and quiet! Located in a gorgeous building and an amazing neighborhood. I was in town for work and barely at the apartment, so I never actually encountered Yolande (how crazy!)...but she kept the place incredibly tidy and was welcoming from the start.[QWERTY123]GREAT apartment and uber stylish as is lovely Yolanda, a fabulous host.  Huge light filled room with 2 cupboards and a desk, perfect for laptop if you happen to be working... Private bathroom a bonus, close to great restaurants, bars, cafes, subway in tree lined streets of Fort Green. Super easy access to Manhattan by subway, Highly recommend!![QWERTY123]Yolande’s more than beautiful and tidy apartment is in a very pleasant, save and quiet neighborhood in Brooklyn/Fort Green – Manhattan can easily be reached by Metro. We (the hirable room is big enough for 2) actually didn’t meet that often during our stay, but she ever was an amiable and helpful host. We would highly recommend her place![QWERTY123]Wir haben uns sehr wohl gefühlt! Yolande haben wir nur zweimal kurz gesehen, sie ist aber sehr freundlich und hilfsbereit und antwortete sehr schnell auf Anfragen. Die Wohnung ist geschmackvoll eingerichtet, sehr hell und sauber. Die Schlüsselübergabe verlief unkompliziert über Portier. Die Nachbarschaft ist sehr entspannt, nett und sicher.[QWERTY123]Yolande's apartment is absolutely fantastic. Everything is beautifully decorated and very clean. The bed was comfortable, lots of space in the room, and you get your own bathroom. Yolande was very friendly and helpful. She had lots of great tips for things to do around the area and was willing to help out in any way. The apartment building itself is very nice, in a good area, with a doorman and an elevator (!). There are lots of shops nearby - supermarkets, dining options etc. It is close to BAM (Brooklyn Academy of Music) which has lots of great shows, and also close to the flea market on Saturdays. My favourite cafe was Smooch (suggested by Yolande) and The General Greene for salted caramel ice cream. There are a few subway stations in the area servicing different lines - all about a ten or fifteen minute walk. A cab into Lower Manhattan cost me about $15. I would definitely stay here again. I was sad to leave.[QWERTY123]Yolande's apartment is gorgeous, spotlessly clean and extremely comfortable. In a fantastic neighborhood. Yolande herself is kind and lovely and welcoming. I can't say enough good things about her or her place. This was a fantastic experience.[QWERTY123]Yolande has got a really nice appartment in a very safe and beautiful neighborhood with a lot of brownstones and some nice shops and restaurants. Although a trip to Manhattan takes some time (it is not very close to the subway stations), it is always a pleasure to return to this area.

Yolande was out or in her own room a lot and gives you enough privacy, but she is open to have a chat and give advice or help you out. This was very nice and helpful! You can use the kitchen and living room. The mattress is really good.

Note that the bathroom is yours but not accessible from within your room, just two steps from the room though. Overall, we had a great stay and would definitely recommend it.[QWERTY123]Everything was perfect. The room and bathroom were exceptionally clean and comfortable and the neighborhood was beautiful and charming. Fort Greene is an excellent place to stay - close to the pharmacy and numerous shops and restaurants; only a short commute to Manhattan. Loved staying here.[QWERTY123]Yolande's apartment is incredible, she has great taste and has made her home insanely comfortable and stylish. Its a great NYC experience. The room is large as is the bathroom and impeccably clean. Yolande interacts with you as much as you like and makes you feel comfortable to do your own thing while you are staying at her place.

Fort Greene is also a wonderful, leafy, quiet neighbourhood, Its great to come home after a day in Manhattan to somewhere a little more quiet, especially if you are staying in NYC for a while. Having said that, it's still is a vibrant area and theres lot of great restaurants, bars and cafes in the area. 

In my case, I relocated to NYC for grad school and stayed with Yolande for a month. I felt very at ease, I was studying/working a lot and she was happy for me to do that from her place. We got along very well and I see Yolande as a new friend in New York that I will continue to stay in touch with. I highly recommend staying with Yolande, she's is a wonderful host.[QWERTY123]Ons verblijf bij Yolande is geweldig goed bevallen. Het appartement is ruim, sfeervol en authentiek wat maakte dat wij ons er direct prettig voelden. Het was iedere dag weer het gevoel van thuis komen. Ook de omgeving droeg daartoe bij.  Het appartement is gelegen in een hippe, groene wijk met direct om de hoek een hele reeks leuke restaurantjes. 's Nachts is het er heerlijk rustig waardoor we sliepen als roosjes.
We hebben Yolande maar weinig gesproken doordat wij zelf de hele dag op pad waren en doordat het appartement zo is ingedeeld dat zij vooral in haar eigen privé ruimte verbleef. Wellicht hadden wij het wel leuk gevonden om iets meer contact te hebben en haar bijzondere tips te benutten. Maar als we elkaar spraken was ze altijd behulpzaam en vriendelijk. 

[QWERTY123]FABULOUS apartment; clean, warm, beautifully decorated. The photos don't do it justice. Kitchen and bathroom are great, bed is comfy. Yolande is easy going and friendly - you'll enjoy her relaxed hosting. The only downside is the distance from a subway station (door to door it was about 45 minutes into Manhattan) but in the summer it would be a nice walk. Groceries, fantastic bars, parks and cafés are all very close! Thank you Yolande. We'll recommend you to family and friends!!![QWERTY123]The reservation was canceled 41 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.[QWERTY123]dear yolande, many thanks for the nice stay in ny. beautiful apartment, good location and very cozy.[QWERTY123]My experience at Yolande's has been amazing! I travel a lot to NY and this is the best place I've stayed at so far. The apartment is in a very nice area of Brooklyn and in a safe building with doorman. Yolande is an artist so her apartment has a very good taste. It has a lot of light and is very spacious. My bedroom was amazing: bright, clean, plenty of space and the washroom is private. Which to me makes a lot of difference. Yolande is a lovely person: sweet, private and respectful. I will come back![QWERTY123]Abbiamo soggiornato per una settimana nel bellissimo appartamento di Yolande ed è stata un'esperienza perfetta!
La stanza è curatissima e molto accogliente, proprio come nelle fotografie, e Yolande è sempre stata molto disponibile nel dare suggerimenti ed informazioni su qualunque cosa. La casa si trova a 10 minuti a piedi dalla metropolitana più vicina da cui poi si raggiunge velocemente Manhattan. Il quartiere in cui si trova è molto tranquillo e sicuro, con numerosi bar e ristoranti ad un paio di isolati di distanza.
Se siete diretti a New York questa è una bellissima opportunità per godere anche del quartiere di Brooklyn. 
Consigliato!![QWERTY123]The room is comfy, the apartment is nice, very clean and tastefully decorated. Yolande is very nice and the neighborhood is great as well.
Thanks Yolande![QWERTY123]I really enjoyed my time at Yolandes place! She created a relaxed and easy going atmosphere. The apartment was clean, Yolande gave me a chip card for the laundry room and I could use her kitchen when I felt like cooking something, from time to time :) I highly recommend her as a host and I'll definitely text her next time I'm in town.[QWERTY123]Para nosotros fue el lugar perfecto 
Un barrio muy interesante, a un agradable paseo para cruzar el puente de Manhattan y Brookly.   
Cerca de Vinegar Hill
Nosotros lo hicimos andando. 
La casa es preciosa ,limpia y con un olor fresco y relajante. 
Con tu propio cuarto de bano limpio con toallas nuevas y suaves. 
Yolanda estuvo fuera,pero estuvo pendiente en todo momento de nosotros. 
Nos sentimos como en casa."	40.69673094528168	-73.9758385907271	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/12303	2	120.0	0.825

All the comms were fantastic and the place and the facilities were better than I expected from the photos. Great option for anybody wanting to be in Williamsburg. Its a really comfortable apartment with an AWESOME kitchen.[QWERTY123]We had a great stay at Eric's place in Williamsburg, Brooklyn.  Everything was exactly as advertised.  While we did not get to meet Eric, he left very detailed instructions on how everything in the apartment worked and how to get around the neighborhood.  The subway was less than 2 blocks away--very easy ride into Manhattan.  Overall, a great experience![QWERTY123]We had a wonderful day at Erik's home- it's on a quiet street which is exactly what you need after a day romping around the city.  It is clean and comfortable- almost set up like a showroom so you dont feel like you're invading someone's personal space. It is clear he is a passionate traveler and his decorating reflects it. Once you see his map of places he's visited, it  will undoubtedly inspire your next trip. He was very easy to deal with and everything went smoothly. His flat is walking distance to the tube, and several restaurants including a little market right on the corner with delicious sandwiches. It is a lovely walk to the easy river ferry, and you will see a lot if what Williamsburg has to offer on your journey. Bedford, the main drag is only a ten minute walk and is full of life, pubs and shops. We would definitely stay at Erik's place again- thanks for the hospitality Erik!!![QWERTY123]I had a great 4 days at Erik's apartment. Really smart, clean, everything you would need and homely to boot! Great kitchen if you want to do some cooking, chilled out lounge area and comfy bed. The bathroom's Jacuzzi tube is a real treat after walking the streets during the day. The location is perfect, near to the subway but also in a hip area with coffee shops and street life. I would def recommend staying here. Excellent choice.[QWERTY123]My wife and I spent five nights at Erik’s apartment.  It was our first Airbnb experience.  An excellent choice!  While we didn’t meet Erik because he was travelling, he left us detailed instructions on the use of his place and made arrangements to answer any other questions that might arise.  We’ve been to Manhattan on numerous occasions but had never stayed in Brooklyn.  We enjoyed the neighbourhood.  The apartment was great, the bed very comfortable.  His kitchen is a bonus.  The street is quiet.  The subway is very close and the East River Ferry dock is a ten minute stroll.  Union Square is only ten minutes away by subway. We’ll stay here again – thanks, Erik.[QWERTY123]We only stayed a night in Erik's place, but this was an entirely pleasant experience. The communication was easy and pleasant and we found all as described. I can recommend Erik as a host and his place as a place to stay in NY![QWERTY123]Perfect. Erik was always very easy to get in touch with and left us meticulous notes about his apartment, proactively addressing any questions we might have had. 

Best of all - his place is amazing - lovely bright space and a bed that feels like a strong and wonderful cloud. Highly recommend! 

[QWERTY123]Great first experience with AirBnB, Erik was extremely accommodating and the place exceeded all expectations. The place was immaculately clean and the location was to die for. There is alot of places to eat/drink around the area and was a great place to stay in. Highly recommended +++[QWERTY123]It's a shame I didn't get to meet Erik in person. He was very friendly & efficient in his communication. 
The apartment is tailored to every modern traveller's whim. You also have the privilege of being situated in one of New York's hippest neighbourhoods. The L train takes you into Manhattan within minutes. All in all you will get great value for your money.[QWERTY123]We had a great stay at Erik's place. The apartment was spacious and had everything you could need. The place is conveniently located within walking distance of the subway, Bedford Ave and the East River Ferry. Erik was very helpful and a pleasure to deal with. Highly recommended![QWERTY123]If you're looking for somewhere to stay in New York look no further! 

Erik's apartment is even better than the description & has all of the amenities to make your stay extremely conformable, particularly the bed which is amazing! It's in a perfect location with plenty of great places to eat and drink all within 5-20 minutes walk (most within 10 minutes but a few recommendations from Erik were 20 mins and definitely worth the walk!). The subway is less than 5 minutes away making the journey into Manhattan very quick and easy.

Erik is an excellent host, providing lots of helpful information for your stay including great restaurant recommendations all over New York. While we didn't meet Erik or his brother (who helps manage things while Erik is O/S) in person, communication was great before, during and even after our stay. 

I can highly recommend Erik apartments & have already passed the details onto a few friends who are heading to New York next Spring! I would definitely stay again.[QWERTY123]Our stay at Erik's apartment was very enjoyable. The apartment was exactly as the pictures portrayed and was very convenient to the subway. Erik was a terrific host and we had no problems at all getting in. He left us terrific notes about the apartment and neighborhood. Erik's communication before and during our visit was prompt and helpful. The neighborhood is quiet with a small market, wine shop and bagel shop within a block or two. We had dinner at a cute restaurant just a block away as well. We would certainly stay here again the next time we are in Brooklyn.[QWERTY123]Erik was a pleasure to communicate with, and his apartment was the best I've stayed in as a visitor to NYC. I lived in Manhattan for two years and have stayed in several different apartments in Brooklyn and Manhattan. Erik's place stands out as the best both for its built-in comforts (blackout shades, excellent TV, luxurious kitchen and bathroom) as well as smaller details (remarkable cleanliness, ease of communication with the host). 

Its proximity to the subway makes it easy and convenient to get to Union Square in ten minutes, and from there to most notable locations in downtown and midtown Manhattan in another ten minutes or less.  For someone like me - with friends and activities in both boroughs and visiting New York just for a weekend - this location allowed me to make the most of my time in the city by minimizing the amount of time spent on Subways and cabs, or - worse - walking to find a Subway or cab. 

Erik could not be better as a host. He was 100% professional and welcoming, and made my experience completely hassle-free.[QWERTY123]We had a great stay in Eric's apartment! The neighborhood was busy but safe and very convenient for us ! The Subway was about 2 blocks away and we enjoyed the corner deli and a very nice bakery for morning coffee  and cookies . Although we didn't meet Erik he made it very easy for us to get the key and left detailed instructions regarding everything we would need. I felt  that we could contact him if we had any questions or problems but we didn't need to![QWERTY123]Très belle expérience dans l'appartement d'Erik. Il est bien situé, à deux pas de deux lignes de métro, dont la L qui permet de rejoindre Manhattan en 15mn. Le quartier est calme, mais il suffit de peu de temps à pieds pour trouver restaurants et animations. On circule de nuit sans crainte.
Erik est sinon très disponible et serviable. Nous nous sommes juste croisés à JFK pour la remise des clefs (il partait en France pour le travail :-) ), mais il a tout fait pour rendre notre séjour agréable. A conseiller.[QWERTY123]Our stay was excellent. All directions and guidelines concerning appliances, technology, and dos and don’ts were very clear. When we arrived, we were about 2 hours late because of crazy traffic! However, Mark (Erik's brother) was very nice in waiting for us at the apartment and asking us if we had any questions about the area. I was traveling with 3 other people, 2 of which were my older children. Once Erik learned that I had 2 older children, he immediately was kind in offering them an extra air mattress to sleep on. The apartment itself was a little dusty so we had to dust and clean before we felt comfortable. The apartment was located close to the train station and was very convenient for travel. Both Erik and Mark were prompt to reply to any emails we had sent them. Erik also let us stay later than the check out time because our flight was at 6PM. Overall, we were very satisfied with our stay and are happy Erik allowed us to stay in his apartment.
[QWERTY123]Didn't get to meet Erik, but his brother was super helpful getting my parents and my sister checked in. The space is just lovely, we all enjoyed how the space looked and talked forever about how much we love the decorations and the space Erik created around the living room/kitchen. The apartment is also super conveniently located for getting around, great experience :)[QWERTY123]I have recently returned from New York and had the pleasure of staying at Erik's flat in Brooklyn.
It was a great spot, very close to Lorimer Street station so 15 mins or so on the subway to Manhattan and also a short walk from Bedford Avenue where there are some really  nice bars and restaurants.
We were 3 guys staying there and it worked really well.

The flat was very clean, lots of towels and a good sized bathroom as well.
The flat itself is great, very modern kitchen set up and whilst I didnt cook whilst there there it has a good benchtop and space to sit and eat.
Really good sized apartment for 3/4 people staying in Brooklyn.

Erik was a very helpful host, giving me lots of information and recommendations of nice bars, restaurants in the area.  He always responded promptly and I visited quite a few of his tips and enjoyed myself at all of them.

Brooklyn is a fun place as well quieter than the hustle and bustle of Manhattan and after long days out it was good to be able to relax in the area and the apartment.


I would definitely recommend this apartment to a couple, or 3/4 friends travelling together.

Thank you Erik for your kind hospitality and ensuring we had a good stay in New York.  
I hope to visit again sometime!!

Marco
[QWERTY123]We spent a beatiful time in Erik's apartment. The location was perfect to stay in Brooklyn or to move to Manahattan. The apartment was clean enough.

We didn't meet Erik, but his brother Mark was very friendly.

Thank you guys ![QWERTY123]As soon as we made our request to stay in Erik's apartment, we felt like we had made the right decision.  His communication from the very beginning was consistent and we even received a ""Welcome to Brooklyn"" text as soon as our flight landed.  His home was clean, nicely decorated, and included a very detailed list of how to navigate all of the amenities.  This made us feel very at home!  In addition, he provided an extensive list of recommended restaurants which took the pressure off of us to do our own research.  We went to several of them and were never disappointed.  The neighborhood is great with easy access to the L train that took us into Manhattan within 10 minutes.  This was overall a fantastic stay an we hope to visit Erik's place again soon.[QWERTY123]Had a fantastic time at Erik's place! Very clean and homey! He left a really nice itinerary and even left out complimentary tea and coffee! The travel theme in the apartment was really impressive and interesting! Plenty of space too- and the futon was really comfortable! We also enjoyed the entertainment system, complete with Netflix! Thanks so much Erik! :)[QWERTY123]Great stay in this lovely place. Location is fantastic, close to subways, and Williamsburg is a great cafe town which has a hip and safe vibe.
Host brother picked us up from the air port which was a great stress relief, he was super friendly and helpful. 
The host checked up on us through out our stay.
The place is really nice, feels homely and is a nice place to chill out after a day of adventuring in New York.
[QWERTY123]Great place. The four of us fit we'll (two in a queen size bed, one in the sofá bed and an air matress. Great connection to Manhattan by the L train[QWERTY123]Excellent location, quite, close to the undergroud L and at few minutes walk from markets and shops. Really nice apartment, very welcoming, high level equipped. 
Communication with Erik was always prompt and easy. He and his brother were always reachable, they have been nice and helpful all the time.
Such a lovely stay, we hope to be back soon and would highly recommend it.[QWERTY123]Erik's home is placed in a quiet and safe neighborhood, and in a strategic location to reach Manhattan in a short time: just four subway stops away from Union Square, one of the most important hubs in NYC. We didn't meet Erik, but his brother Mark responded effectively to our request: even if the apartment is fully heated, one of us needed another blanket, and we received it promptly. The place was faithful to the description on the Airbnb site, with attention to every detail: I appreciated so much the double curtains, tailor-made for blocking out the morning sun and keeping the bedroom dark. A positive experience, we happily recommend.[QWERTY123]If you want to stay in Brooklyn it's hard to find a better place. Erik's place is close to the L which will give you easy access to the entire city. There's great food, cafes, and bars nearby.[QWERTY123]Erik's place was great! Very clean!! Located so close to the L train that was only minutes from Manhattan. Check in was easy and quick. Everything we needed was there! The neighborhood was good and safe. We had such a awesome time there we will definatly stay there again if we return. If your looking for a place when visiting NY this is it!!!![QWERTY123]home away from home with amazing comfort! Can't get a better location! 10/10[QWERTY123]Great accommodations and value for the space. The close proximity of the apartment to public transportation was key. Overall great experience."	40.7145913915401	-73.94844313020789	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/25406	4	139.0	0.833333

It is located very close to a subway line so it was very easy to access the rest of the city. Dena, was a lovely hostess and gave us the low-down on the city since it was our first time visiting. I would recommend her place to anyone.[QWERTY123]The room and bathroom were fine. Dena is a great host, she has been very helpful in giving us directions to get to her apartment. The location was great and very close to the subway.[QWERTY123]The space was large and spacious, and Dena was a nice hands off host. Let us do our thing and gave us a nice intro to the place. The apartment was in good condition, nice kitchen and overall cleanliness. The building was really nice with an  upscale feel and art on the walls, with a doorman and an elevator. Parking was convenient and the neighborhood had lots of places to explore. 
A/C and Elevator made it a really nice place to stay during the summertime in the city. We would definitely return.[QWERTY123]Apartment is as-advertised, with the minor exception of sharing the 2nd bathroom with Dena's roommate - no problems there, it is very clean and has great hair products (haha). Dena herself is very nice, and my experience was a good one - would definitely stay with her again.[QWERTY123]I was quite pleased with my stay at Dena's.  She was honest about her apartment and quite clear in her instructions for getting the key.  We didn't get to meet this trip but her courtesy and clarity along with  the quality of her building including doorman insure that I will avail myself of her apartment again.[QWERTY123]Dena's location is just as advertised and more. The location, comfort and proximity to the MTA couldn't be better. Dena was a great host and extremely responsive to any questions. The cats were a great bonus!

I highly recommend Dena.[QWERTY123]The reservation was canceled 76 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.[QWERTY123]Thank u dena for maki g our short stay so warm and comfortable!  Ifelt so at home here with you ladies and ""tbe boys"" (kitties) who were much more like dogs tban any cats ive ever met!  Ur place was perfect for us- comfortable bed, living room with interesting  blackboard and nice tv.  We loved having brealfast at yoir retro diner booth from paris!   Thank u for communicating with us so frequently before we arrived.  It made our trip much easier.  You are such an interesting and kind person that i would like to be your friend if we lived in the same city.  We very much appreciated the neighborhood, and would recommend jacobs restaurant across the street for interesting and good ""soul food"" mixed with a lot of creah fruit and salads.  Price was amazingly low.  I would like to have tried some of the more famous restaurants in the area but we didnt have enuff time.  We hope to meet you again in our life journeys..randi & randy[QWERTY123]Dena was a great host! Super welcoming and friendly.
I had a fantastic time staying here on my first trip to NYC. Anyone looking for a place to stay in manhattan who does not want to pay the very high hotel rates should consider staying here. This has been my 1st AirBnB experience and I know based on this I will be using the service again.

Thanks Dena![QWERTY123]Dena was a wonderful host: she was very helpful and friendly. My sister and I had a good time there. She was also really flexible with check ins and check outs. And finally, she has two totally cute cats - we love them :))[QWERTY123]She is a gracious interesting host; very pleasant to be around.[QWERTY123]The apartment is excellent (better than the pictures), also the building (with doorman, elevator and gym). We love the neighborhood, 4 shorts blocks to the express 2,3 subway (15 minutes to Time Square), supermarket right downstairs, plenty of bars. Dena is an excellent hostess, recommend for all, one of my best experiences using airbnb, thanks![QWERTY123]Dena is a very kind person and I feel really honored to meet her. The place is very clean and also very artistic. We fell in love with the black board and the booth in the living room. It is impossible not to fall in love with Dena's cats. We really enjoyed our stay and made very good conversation with Dena and she helped us a lot about where to visit in nyc.[QWERTY123]It is realy luxury flat in luxury building! With original design:)
Dena was very kind and hospitable, as if we did not come for the first time!
Hope we could stay with Dena next visit in NY and will be able to communicate more:)[QWERTY123]Dena is just a wonderful, warm person. I was using her space for a photo shoot and she was very accommodating and the space itself is beautiful. And so big! Great all around.[QWERTY123]Dena was great! We felt very comfortable in her apartment and helped us with directions and locations. We will miss Timmy and Gizmo![QWERTY123]Dena was a great host.
She was very cool and always available.
Her cats are also very adorable.
We will definitely come back to her house :)
Thanks Dena
[QWERTY123]I really like the room decoration! it's very cool! room is clean and tidy, everything is perfect except the location, it's a little bit far from the attractions but the subway is very convenient.[QWERTY123]I feel so much secure during my stay at Dena's house.  She respects my privacy, and with some nice advice and concern.  Thank you so much for your hospitality.[QWERTY123]A beautiful apartment, a warm welcome in a really cool area of Harlem, this has been our first time in NY and the very first experience with Airbnb. We thank Dena for her availability and suggestions, people make the difference between an ordinary stay  and an unforgettable experience![QWERTY123]Dena was great. This was my first airbnb experince and I was very pleased. The apartment and room were exactly as advertised. Dena was very accommodating and  helpful. I would definitely stay here again and would recommend this experience to anyone looking for a safe place to stay in New York.[QWERTY123]I found Dena to be a cool chick . She was very friendly, helpful ,accommodating and easy to get on with .  The accommodation was very comfortable , clean and close to shops and transport . I would therefore ,  recommend her place to anyone looking for a similar experience[QWERTY123]Our stay at Dena's place was very comfortable, Dena is very easy going, helpful person and everything was coordinated before our arrival. The apartment is just as on the pictures, nice and clean. The location is brilliant due to near subway stations and shopping opportunities on nearby streets. We will definitely stay at Denas place if we visit NYC again.[QWERTY123]Hey, we had a great time at Dena'place: perfect location close to the metro, very nice appartment and we felt welcome. I would definitely recommand it![QWERTY123]Enjoyed my stay in Dena's comfortable, clean condo. Both she and her room mate are easy-going, interesting, and fun, and I felt at home. Loved how convenient it was to downtown Manhattan. Interesting to see Harlem, a neighborhood in transition. I always felt safe.

Also, Dena was great communicating with me prior to booking. Made a big difference. I look forward to returning.[QWERTY123]We felt very comfortable and welcome at Dena's appartment. The room was very clean and spacious and we had our own toilette. The appartment is very close from the express red line that takes you to times square in a few stops. Dena was very nice and friendly to us and we totally love her cats!! We highly recommend to stay at Dena's place.[QWERTY123]This is the second time that we stay at Dena's appartment. As we already mentioned, the place was spacious and clean and Dena was a nice host! There are also many nice restaurants in the área and the subway is very close. We would happily stay again any time![QWERTY123]Dena is very kind. We had a good time getting along with her. Staying at her house is comfortable and relaxed. She helps us with any question we had. You can easily get to her house by metro. It is our first airbnb experience and we definately had a great time here! :)[QWERTY123]Dena is a perfect host : nice, helpfull, she let us do what we needed to do in the apartment. The bedroom is enough big for two people. The area is secure and we really loved Central Harlem!! There are always people around, liveliness and for me, it's more breathable than in the heart of Manhattan. I would recommand this place. Thank you Dena![QWERTY123]L'appartement correspondait exactement à ce qui nous avait été décrit. Dena est une personne charmante. Elle était à la fois discrète et toujours prête à nous aider et à discuter.
Le quartier est beau et sympa, les gens y sont chaleureux. 
L'appartement est proche de deux lignes de métro et de plusieurs arrêts de bus. Il y a un supermarché juste en bas de l'immeuble (ouvert jusqu'à tard).
Les chats de Dena sont très amicaux (dès les premiers instants), si vous avez des chats cela vous donnera l'impression d'être à la maison.

L'appartement, la salle de bain, la cuisine étaient propre.
[QWERTY123]Dana's place is perfect if you want to visit New York City. It is exactly as described, the public transport just a couple of blocks away, the cats are cute (and only at night a bit weird in their behaviour ;)) and Dana is a wonderful host. She's very friendly and helpful and we really enjoyed our stay. Thanks for having us.[QWERTY123]Dena was a lovely host very welcoming. Her apartment in Harlem is in a good location, close to a subway stop and there are some nice bars/restaurants near by. I loved the Sunday jazz brunch at Sapphire. the food and vibe there is good.

The apartment is big, lots of space and retro. The room is how is appears in the pictures. The bed was a little uncomfortable (and led to a few restless nights) you can feel the springs in the mattress. Nothing that a mattress stopper couldn't sort out.[QWERTY123]Had a great stay at Dena's apartment!  Area is very lively, did not one feel unsafe and uncomfortable. Due to our busy schedules, I didn't get a chance to actually meet Dena, but she was very easy to reach via email. I would stay here again and recommend this unit to a friend.[QWERTY123]We stayed at Dena's place for five wonderful days at October 2014. It was very easy to find the apartment and Dena helped us with the bus from the airport and gave us great tips. The apartment is very comfortable and cosy. Dena made us fill like we're home. We highly recommend and hope to come back soon.[QWERTY123]Amazing apartment, clean, modern and great location. Very close to metro which connects you to all the major sights. Dena was a lovely host,  very welcoming and the cats friendly too!! Would definitely recommend. Great coffee shop accross the street - bagles for breaky were great![QWERTY123]Dena was nice and very friendly. The apartment is comfortable and clean. Dena had some helpful tips for us and we would stay again with her. Recommended.[QWERTY123]Dena's spacious home is an excellent site for exploring Harlem with easy bus access to both east and west sides of Manhattan and restaurants, markets, coffee shops, etc. close by. Her two friendly cats made us feel right at home. Although we did not meet Dena, her roommate Vanessa was helpful in answering our questions. We look forward to returning to NY and staying with Dena again and recommend this location highly.[QWERTY123]Dena's apartment is very well located in Harlem, close to subway, restaurants and big avenues. It is in an almost all-inclusive luxury building, you will need nothing else but food. Just complaining a little bit about guest room curtains and Dena's pets, hair cat is all over the house. 
Everything else, perfect! 
Very good relation between cost-benefits![QWERTY123]Everything was like in the description: subway station close to the apartments, the room is exactly like in the photos. Dena was very friendly and helpful. Good place to stay and feel the real Harlem's spirit![QWERTY123]Great place to stay in NY! Dena was very hospitable and get to communicate with. She gave us clear instructions on how to get there from the airport. There is a subway close by and some nice coffee shops opposite.
Thanks again[QWERTY123]Our stay at Dena's was wonderfull the neighbourhood and the appartement where great! Dena was very helpfull and we enjoyed the time  at the appartement.[QWERTY123]Dena was bright and cheerful upon my arrival.  She made sure that the room had everything I needed and that I knew where everything was.  She helped make me feel at home which was nice.  I also liked the cats waddling around.[QWERTY123]After I had stayed in Brooklyn for 4 nights, which was my first Airbnb experience, I stayed with Dena for 6 nights. I just wanted to see two different areas during my stay. I travelled alone, took the subway for transportation ( 2 and 3 trains within a few minutes distance at 125st ). The doorman opened the doors when I arrived and checked out, it was like entering the Waldorf :-) Dena welcomed me and showed me around. I was welcome to use the kitchen and living room as well, great to sit down after a long day of sightseeing. Bed room was good, bed slept well and there was enough space to put away your stuff. WiFi was available, flat-screen TV in the living room ( that was big, like the rest of the place ). Dena and her friend Vanessa were very friendly and so were Gizmo and Timothy, my furry friends in Harlem :-) Ok, when you don't like cats or have an allergy this is not the place for you but they are very friendly and certainly not shy.  There is also a gym on the same floor which looked good but which I also did not used with my tight schedule. I visited two nearby 'soul-food restaurants', Sylvia's and The Red Rooster and I can recommend both. There is also a supermarket downstairs and a nice coffee-shop across the street ( Lenox Coffee ) . Try the almond croissant, jummie! This place gives you a bit of a Harlem experience, a luxury one, I have to say but who cares :-) Thank you Dena for the welcoming feeling you gave me during my stay, I had a good time and would certainly recommend your place to future guests. Say hi to Gizmo and Timothy, they also gave me a good feeling everyday when I entered or walked around the apartment![QWERTY123]Dena is an awesome host :) 
Her place is just as advertised and more. She's friendly and always willing to help. 
We totally recommend her.[QWERTY123]Great stay in New York, safe area and good metro connection to downtown. Dena was helpful and a good host, the cats were also good company! We would stay here again during our next visit![QWERTY123]We had a great experience staying with Dena. She's an amazing woman with what seems like an exciting life.
We could come anytime we wanted because the doorman could hold on the key so that was really nice.
The apartment itself is huge, basically the kind of apartment you see in any serie or sitcom with a cool decoration.
The room was great and we had everything we needed.
We'll make sure to get in touch with her next time we go to New York City.[QWERTY123]Dena's place is fabulous! And she's very welcoming and accommodating! We enjoyed our 5 night stay and highly recommend staying at Dena's place![QWERTY123]The apartment is right like it looks in picture, it´s a very comfortable room. 
Dena is a kind and discreet host. She provided us everything we needed, so that we spent a very nice stay. Her two cats are incredibly cute and friendly, they welcomed us as members of the family. ;-)
We recommend this place![QWERTY123]My first time using airbnb with Dena was quite pleasant. She and her cats are very friendly. The place is clean and is just like the pictures. We didn't get to interact much with her and the other roommate since we spent most of our time exploring the city. So I guess it is just what we needed, a comfortable place to crash.[QWERTY123]Dena was a great host. Room was clean, bed very comfortable. Great bathroom.  Very accommodating with check in and out.  Had a nice conversation about the neighborhood.  Would definitely go back.  Really cool art and furniture[QWERTY123]Nous avons passé 2 semaines chez Dena, et c est génial!!! L appartement est super sympa, exactement comme sur les photos, la chambre est très bien, et le lit très confortable!!!!? Dena est très agréable, très gentille, disponible pour nous conseiller pour le métro ou autre....
Nous avons fait la connaissance de Guizmo et Timy, ne les oublions pas, qui sont trop mignons!!!!! Notre séjour était parfait, tout comme Dena!!!![QWERTY123]Dena and her roommate were friendly, welcoming and helpful.  The apartment was modern, well-maintained, and conveniently located with subway and bus nearby.  With a doorman downstairs it also felt safe. I especially liked that it was a corner apartment with large windows and there were coffee shops and restaurants within walking distance. Plan to return when in NYC.[QWERTY123]Nous sommes ravis de notre séjour chez Dena, elle nous  a accueilli chaleureusement et a toujours été très gentille. 
L' appartement correspond aux photos, il est propre, et il y a très peu de bruit de l'exterieur. 
Le quartier est très sympa, il y a tout ce qu'il faut à seulement quelques pas de l'appartement : restauration rapide, restaurants sympas; et le métro est à quelques rues. 
Il faut environ 15 min pour rejoindre Time square en métro. 
Je vous recommande vivement cet appartement ![QWERTY123]El barrio muy cerca del metro a 3 cuad (Website hidden by Airbnb) senti muy bien y comoda[QWERTY123]This place was definitely all that and then some!! Its located walking distance from great restaurants and the subway is about 3 blocks and will take you anywhere you want to go in NY. Easy and convenient!! We took the public bus from the airport which was another perk. Dena's condo is just like the pictures and her cats Gizmo and Timmy were great company! Laundry and gym on they same floor was a super bonus. Oh and I can't forget the grocery store, another perk! We met Dena on our last day and she's just as awesome as her place. We look forward to another visit soon.[QWERTY123]The host canceled this reservation 38 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.[QWERTY123]Dena was extremely helpful while our week long stay in NYC. Her place was very conveniently near by a few subways as well as good restaurants. The actual place looked just like the pictures and everything was well kept. Gizmo and Tim were very friendly and playful. Thanks again Dena![QWERTY123]L'appartement est conforme à la description et assez grand. La chambre dans laquelle nous étions donne côté rue donc très bruyante,   le lit n'est pas super confortable.

Le quartier est donc Harlem, ça ne craint pas mais l'ambiance est spéciale et c'est un quartier assez pauvre.

L'appartement est situé près d""une bouche de métro donc ça c'est parfait mais est au nord de Manhattan, donc métro indispensable pour se déplacer tous les matins;

L'appartement n'était pas hyper propre. De plus, nous n'avons vu Deana que deux ou trois fois durant notre séjour, nous avons très peu échangé avec elle et nous n'avons pas forcément senti qu'elle désirait échanger plus que cela, même pas du tout en réalité. 

Bref nous étions des hôtes de passage pour Deana qui n'a pas été très chaleureuse ( à sa décharge elle travaillait durant la période de séjour, donc très peu présente, nous étions également absents toute la journée).[QWERTY123]Trotz dem Dena uns nicht persönlich in Empfang nehmen konnte, hatte sie für alles notwendige gesorgt. Notwendige Informationen waren in einem für uns hinterlegten Brief zusammengefasst und bei Fragen war sie für uns auch immer mobil erreichbar.

Die Wohnung war, trotz der zwei (liebenswerten) Katzen ""big"" Timmy und Gizmo, sauber, aufgeräumt und modern. Das Gebäude liegt an einer belebten Hauptstraße in Harlem, an der es am Wochenende auch mal etwas lauter sein kann. Bei geschlossenem Fenster ist die Lautstärke für eine Stadt wie New York aber durchaus akzeptabel. Die nächste (Express) U-Bahn ist nur wenige Gehminuten entfernt.

Dena selbst ist eine sehr freundliche und weltoffene Person mit der man sich sehr gut unterhalten kann. Bei Bedarf konnten wir uns aber auch komplett in unser eigenes Zimmer zurückziehen und für uns sein.

tldr: Dena war eine vorbildliche Gastgeberin mit einer schönen Wohnung. Jederzeit gerne wieder![QWERTY123]We had a wonderful time in New York,  Dena and her roommate were very good hosts.  The apartment was as described and it was close to the subway station, buses and grocery store.  I felt very safe going to and from the subway stations anytime of day or night.   Dena answered any questions we had and helped with advice if asked.   Overall a good 1st experience on airbnb!

[QWERTY123]When we arrived at the appartement, Dena was not there but she left us a clear message with the doorman (which gave us a safe feeling about the place). We texted her in advance a few times and she answered us really quickly. Dena is a kind born and raised New Yorker. You can ask her anything.

The room was perfectly fine. We only missed a closet/shelf to put our clothes in. Because we stayed 7 days, we had a lot of clothes and stuff. The bathroom is shared with a roommate. That is something to consider, but Dena told us clearly in advance. There are two awesome, very nice cats. We loved them.

When we booked we had some doubts about Harlem but it seemed that we were completely wrong about that. The people are very nice and helpful. If you are a light sleeper you should consider bringing earplugs. New York really is the city that never sleeps ;-)

Tip: go check out the public rooftop of the building. It gives you a very nice view of Harlem.[QWERTY123]Nous avons pu récupérer les clefs très facilement. Nous avons rencontré Dena le deuxième ou troisième jour, les rapports ont été cordiaux.  
L'appartement a été au delà de la description, très beau, très grand, dans un immeuble avec portier. La chambre est agreable. Attention une seule salle de bain avec les toilettes dedans. 
Il est situé à 4 blocs du métro et le quartier est chouette. On rejoint facilement le sud de manhattan et il y a un autre métro,  plus pratique pour les musées à 10/15 mn à pied.[QWERTY123]漂亮的房子､親切的屋主､方便的地點､可愛的貓｡[QWERTY123]Dena was awesome!  Since we arrived so late at night, she left a detailed note about the apartment, where to find things, how to recycle, etc.  She stayed in touch via text when she wasn't around, very welcoming when she was.  Her roommate is also very nice and her kitties were a joy to have around.
Apartment was well -maintained, secure and comfortable.  Room was cozy and clean.  Bathroom spacious, clean, and always had hot water available.
Can't beat the neighborhood.  Coffee shop across the street, grocery store underneath apt building, iconic restaurants and fun new cafes in all directions.  4 short blocks to subway, quick jog to central park.[QWERTY123]Lovely apartment. Handy location a mere 30 mins from central New York. Would recommend.[QWERTY123]Me and my boyfriend really had a great time there in Dena's house. The neighborhood is very dynamic; streets are pretty safe even it's late at night. It's also very easy to have access to any type of restaurants, cool cafes and subway station, the best things is the supermarket is literally on the 1st floor of the building! Our room was very spacious and clean. The kitchen is easy to use, and it basically has everything you need. The experience with Dena and her cutest cats is exceptional![QWERTY123]very nice host,very nice house,very cute cats.[QWERTY123]Dena was such a great host! Her place was clean and conveniently located, she gave me recommendations, and even talked some music with me. Her place was as advertised and I'd definitely recommend it to anyone that is interested in a NY trip. People often have questions about the neighborhood, and I'll say that I felt fine the entire time.[QWERTY123]Dena is amazing! From the first day until the last she let us very comfortable in her apartment. The place is very nice. Since her place is near to a subway station, everything got easy! I really liked it! Ah, I loved her cats as well[QWERTY123]L'appartement était super, on s'est vraiment sentie chez nous. Chambre très agréable. Appartement spacieux et bien décoré.  
Dena est accueillante et nous a donné beaucoup de conseils. Les deux chats sont tranquilles et apaisants. Tout était très simple et efficace (pour les clés par exemple). Nous avons adoré connaître un peu Harlem de l'intérieur. On conseille ![QWERTY123]Deana was a lovely and welcoming host, she made us feel at right at home, and her two cats Timmy & Gizmo are gorgeous! Highly recommend! Thank you Deana![QWERTY123]Awesome location and apartment, Dena was very helpful and nice to us and we loved the cats. Totally recommended.[QWERTY123]The host Dena is very nice,the bed is very comfortable,cleaning,Apt with doorman,pretty save,there are two adorable cats,anyway,it's worth to live.[QWERTY123]Deena was a great host, she recommended us many nice places, always willing to help! The bathroom was clean and the room confortable, with two very friendly cats :) The location is very close to the metro (5min walking) so it was very easy to go downtown. We maybe would have liked to have some free closet space to hang our clothes, but we managed to put them on some hangers available we found. Overall was a great stay and would definitely recommend it.[QWERTY123]My girlfriend and I stayed at Dena's for 6 nights and we had a blast! Even though Dena was out of town she was still helpful and checked in regularly. Her flat is in the heart of Harlem and makes for easy access to the subway! Her cats greeted us right when we first opened the door and made us feel at home the whole time :). Couldn't have stayed at a better place. 5 stars forever.[QWERTY123]Had a great couple in days in NYC and Dena's apartment met our needs. Handy for the subway and a few lovely restaurants. We will be back.[QWERTY123]The flat looks exactly like in the pictures and it is very well located. It's a five minute walk to train lines 2 and 3, and 10 minutes to A and D. I wish I could have stayed longer to get to know the area better because it has a very interesting history! The cats are very friendly.[QWERTY123]It was a great place to stay with good connection to the city. 2 lovely cats and a great hostess. If we ever go to New York again, we will surely visit this place again.  Harlem was a lively neighbourhood and we did not feel unsafe at anytime.[QWERTY123]My friend and I enjoy your stay in New York. Dina was very efficient and very accommodating for our needs. We were in and out at all hours. Attempted to be quiet but the timing was not a problem with anyone. The neighborhood is great during the day. Best to catch a taxi, Uber, or the nearest subway stop past midnight. But that just May reflect my experiences in the past. The cats are great! There's an awesome grocery store on the first floor of the building.[QWERTY123]Dena was such an incredible host and her home is beautiful! She was so welcoming and made us feel right at home. I would definitely love to stay at her place again![QWERTY123]Dena is an awesome host everyone could wish for ! My friend Joelina and I had a blast. We stayed 5 Nights and it was great. Very big and welcoming and she also helped us with everything. Her place is very central, you can reach everything with the metro which is 3 mins away. We highly recommend this place. Thank you Dena for hosting us it was more than great :-).[QWERTY123]T was a great room, close to the subway. Communication with dena was good. We would come back at her place if we visit NY again.[QWERTY123]Dena a été une excellente hôte qui a pris le soin de bien nous accueillir malgré son absence. Cependant un petit bémol quant à la propreté due à la présence des chats ainsi qu'à la colocataire qui n'est pas des plus accueillantes, c'est dommage car nous aurions aimé pouvoir discuter avec nos hôtes. Séjour agréable, le quartier est sympathique et proche du centre de New York.[QWERTY123]Dena was great! Wish we could have hung out more. Her pad was awesome as well as the location. We walked to and from her place to Yankee Stadium and felt perfectly safe. Great food and museums all very close by.[QWERTY123]My friend and I had a great experience staying at Dena's place! She was very welcoming and helpful with all the questions we had about staying in the city. We also loved hanging out with her 2 adorable cats, Gizmo and Timmy! We definitely recommend staying with her. :-)[QWERTY123]We realy enjoyed very well the appartement of Dena. The flat is very spacious, also our room we slept in. We only saw Dena at the day we arrived, but her roommate was very friendly and helped us when we had questions. Everything was very clean and neat. The rooftop an the view were super great and we could have dinner there. The flat is very close to the bus (30 min to the airport) and tube and its easy to get everywhere from there. The two cats are super cute. We would defenetly come again! :) Thanks again[QWERTY123]Very close to the Metro line 3 and a variety of choose for coffee and restaurants nearby. To Times Square only 20 min. Dena was really nice and helpful and I would recommend to experience again.[QWERTY123]Dena's apartment was wonderful. Great location, close to stores, subway, grocery, coffee. Dena was a great host. Welcoming, friendly, accommodating, and gave us our space. Would totally recommend Dena's place to others![QWERTY123]Wir haben uns sehr wohl gefühlt in dem Apartment. Dena war eine tolle Gastgeberin und hat uns viele hilfreiche Tipps für unseren Aufenthalt in New York gegeben. Das Apartment war sauber und gemütlich. Direkt unter dem Apartment befindet sich ein Supermarkt und die Bahnstation ist nur 4 Blöcke entfernt und brachte uns in 10 min zum Times Square. Ich würde das Apartment in jedem Fall nochmal buchen, wenn ich wieder nach New York kommen sollte. :D[QWERTY123]La estancia ha sido perfecta. La casa es preciosa. Dena y Vanny estupendas. Y los gatos muy cariñosos. 
El barrio esta muy bien, muy animado y el metro muy cerca.
Muchas gracias por todo!!
The stay has been perfect . The house is beautiful . Dena and great Vanny . And very loving cats .
The neighborhood is very good, very lively and subway nearby.
Thank you very much for everything!![QWERTY123]Dena is a great host - she made everything for our comfort. 
The key was left at the first floor as Dena wasn't there when we arrived. 
There was gym at the apartments floor. 
Apartment looks exactly as pictured - nice bed and bathroom, big living room.
Cats are amazing :)
Dena is friendly and positive - was nice chatting with her. 
We really enjoyed our stay![QWERTY123]Great location- very close to the 2 & 3 express lines and lovely apartment. Although the host, Dena, keeps busy she was very helpful and available via phone if we needed anything. It was great being able to use the kitchen facilities and enjoy the apartment's unique style while we had breakfast. We were made to feel welcome and the two cats were really friendly. Thanks Dena![QWERTY123]It was a great experience! The place is very nice, close to a subway line, with a caffe and a market 10 steps close. Dena was very helpful and Vanessa too! Also the two cats are very adorable! 
Thanks Dena :)[QWERTY123]We really enjoyed our stay. The apartment itself was absolutely beautiful and in a convenient location. Dena was also super friendly and helpful. We would definitely stay with her again.[QWERTY123]Dena had a letter ready for us at the front desk which had all the information we needed. The apartment was conveniently located close to a subway station and also had many bus routes within a short walking distance. overall we had a great stay for the price we paid.[QWERTY123]We really enjoyed our stay! Dena was very friendly, our room and the appartment where great and the subway was really close. We definitely reccomend this place to everyone. We also loved the cats :) Thanks for everything Dena![QWERTY123]Dena war eine tolle Gastgeberin und hat uns nett empfangen! Die Wohnung und Lage sind perfekt für einen Aufenthalt in NYC!
Jederzeit gerne wieder![QWERTY123]Dena is a great host. She helped us during our trip to find the best way to come to her flat. The flat is close of the subway and it's very easy to go to the downtown. This area of Harlem is also very safe. We had a pleasant travel. Thanks a lot and thanks to the cats (whose are very nice !) ;)[QWERTY123]buen alojamiento, bien situado y calidad precio[QWERTY123]The walk to the apartment from the 2 & 3 train is so close, just 4 blocks and easy to navigate. I think people get nervous about the NY subway system but it was super convenient and made our trip all the more enjoyable, especially being so easily accessible from Dena's apartment. Dena was super accommodating, even with our late arrival. Her welcoming and inviting spirit is truly a breath of fresh air--she's a NY native & has great recommendations for things to do & how to get around. The apartment is awesome, Harlem is incredible (had no worries about safety, it's very up and coming! Gave us a real local taste), and NY was fabulous. Would 100% stay here again. 
And I won't dwell on it too much because Dena would be awesome without them, but the cats are a huge bonus & we loved them so much!  
All in all, an awesome stay for our first time in NY![QWERTY123]Dena was a great host. She always responded on messages and gave very clear indications and useful tips. The place is very well located to the subway and bus stations. The two cats were just gorgeous and come as a bonus! Definitely a place I would go again when I'm back to NYC.[QWERTY123]Dena is very friendly and open minded person who is ready to put all her effort to make you feel like home. The only issue we had was regarding the heating - as it was pretty cold in NYC when we were there, it was pretty cold in the apartment as well. We were allowed to use the heaters at our room but the other parts of the apartment were still too cool for me. Consider this if you are sensitive to the cold issues as I am. Other than this was all fine and I would recommed Dena as your host in NYC.[QWERTY123]This is a great place to stay. Close to Time Square, food and other things to do in NYC. Host was very kind and friendly. I would definitely come back next time.[QWERTY123]La estancia en el apartamento de Dena fue muy buena, Ella siempre fue increiblemente amable y dispuesta a ayudarnos en todo, Incluso pudimos llegar en la madrugada el primer dia y dejar nuestras maletas el ultimo dia hasta las 10pm, esto sin duda fue de gran apoyo.
El edificio es muy bonito y esta muy cerca de la linea roja del metro en 15 min ya estas en el centro de Manhattan . la zona es muy pintoresca y esta justo enfrente de un restaurante de comida sureña que funciona como Buffet (muy buena opcion para una comida llenadora) y tambien tiene varios Deli Store cerca, ahi encontraran fruta, ensaldas, leche y cualquier tipo de comida que les resulte util sin gastar  tanto.  Dena tiene dos gatitos que son verdaderamente adorables.  Muy satisfecha de elegir a Dena para nuestro viaje a NY[QWERTY123]Dena apartment is the right place that you must stay, metro near, good restaurants near, easy to arrive. Dena was honest since beginning that made things easy. If you need something just text her or call her. Her two cats are adorable and made you feel part of her home. Dena thank you for support me with my questions and being patient.[QWERTY123]Dena is a great host and the apartment is very nice and well located. I definitely recomend it. 
Dena was very helpful and let us check in and out at the time that suited us, which was great as it allowed us to enjoy Manhattan until the last minute without having to carry our luggage around.
The bedroom is big enough and full of light. The rest of the apartment is enormous, the living room is amazing. 
There is security 24/7 downstairs and the doormen were welcoming and helpful as well.
The cats are sweet. If you don't like cats, there's no pressure at all to let them in but if you do l, you can enjoy their company.
There is a great coffee place right downstairs to get awesome breakfasts.
[QWERTY123]She's just great! And her cats are lovely[QWERTY123]We absolutely loved our stay at Dena's place. As soon as we walked in we felt so comfortable. The apartment is spacious and gorgeous. The location is perfect! It is so close to the subway so it is very easy to get around. We have previously stayed in midtown and we much preferred staying here! Dena is a wonderful host, so friendly, easy going and her communication prior was fab. Cats Timmy & Gizmo are so friendly and lovely we loved spending time with them during our stay! Totally recommend!![QWERTY123]The apartment is very neat and tidy. The room for us is cozy.Dena is so sweet~Helping us a lot with patience. Nice stay here.[QWERTY123]Muy recomendable, buena comunicación y ubicación en pleno centro de Harlem, habitación espaciosa y una gran anfitriona. Nos ayudó en todo momento y nos facilito mucho la visita a la ciudad. Además, tuvimos a grandes compañeros de piso como Tim y Giz que nos recibían cada día al volver a casa. Volveremos sin duda![QWERTY123]pretty close to the central manhattan area[QWERTY123]Great apartment in Harlem and a nice room. We used it as our base for exploring NYC, which worked out great. Dena was very accommodating. You will share the apartment with two cats, so it helps if you like cats.[QWERTY123]What an amazing stay! We loved absollutely everything about Dena's place, and hope she will continue using Airbnb, so we can stay with her on our next trip as well! 

The company was the perfect mix of welcoming, and relaxed. We even 'netflixed and chilled' together one evening! haha

The cats are great, Dena and her roommate and friends are even better! We loved the neighbourhood, and have nothing but great things to stay about our experience in NYC but especially our experience in Harlem. Perfect hosts! 

Great, spacious apartment.
VERY easy to get to, from multiple options.
Situated in a safe, and lively neighbourhood.
Surrounded by restaurants, happy hours, and pubs. 
Doormen were also very friendly and welcoming every time we came home![QWERTY123]Great place to stay and reasonably priced, walking distance to subway, yummy French patisserie on the way my husband and I would buy a chocolate croissant from then further up a coffee from Starbucks before heading out for the day. Other cool restaurants and cafes local as well.  Room was quiet and a comfortable bed. Shared bathroom but never a problem. Felt safe in the area even at night. Overall a fab stay![QWERTY123]Our stay at Dena's was perfect. The place is right by the subway, it was clean and exactly as described in the profile.  Kitchen was fully equipped. Dena is very fun and interesting to talk to. We loved our days there, thanks for all![QWERTY123]My self and my daughter have just got home from a 4 night break in New York. We stayed at Dena's it was easy to find and the security guy was expecting us with a note and key from Dena. All instructions were very clear to follow and we were soon in, connected to wifi (very important!) and settled in with the cats making us feel very welcome laying all over our things on the bed enjoying a fuss. The room is comfortable enough for what we needed, we met Vanessa first (Dena's lodger) she is lovely. We didn't feel like that we couldn't enjoy the lounge area but at the end of each day upon arriving back we were so tired we crashed on the bed and was asleep by 9pm each night. (The joys of jet lag, we are from England) We did meet Dena one morning and had a nice chat with her. Myself and my daughter felt very welcome during our stay. The area itself is ok, we didn't feel vulnerable walking down the street, its about a mile to the North end of Central Park and about a 5 minute walk to the nearest subway, 125th St. We did a lot of walking in our short stay, the first day we walked to the North end of Central Park and then walked the whole length of it, about 4 miles. Definitely worth doing, its very lovely, being from the country the green surroundings were a welcome sight. There are times you don't even realise you are in the centre of a big city. Even though I am a country girl I know how to handle the city. I love the architecture, there are so many buildings, look up as walking around if not you will miss so much. We were amazed at how much free wifi there is everywhere which was really helpful when trying to work out locations etc. The UK really has no free wifi, even in London nothing like in the US. We checked out lots of the classic sight see'ers locations, Central Park, Times Square, Empire State, Rockerfella, Grand Central Station, 5th Avenue, 9/11 Memorial etc etc. If you are a fan of walking most things can be walked to once Downtown after a short subway trip from 125th St near Dena's. We visited the Statue of Liberty which we pre-booked to include a trip up to her Crown, this needs to be booked in advance, we booked in January for our May trip. We overheard that there weren't any free spaces to visit the crown until September now. They only allow a certain amount of visitors per day. It's well worth doing, its a small space to stand in and a walk up a very small spiral stair case, the views aren't amazing, its the experience of being in her crown that's the great thing, when you are standing back down on the ground looking up at her it seems...[QWERTY123]Nice place to stay. Close to the subway and 'Sylvia's Soulfood' , which is a very good restaurant for breakfast and diner. Lovely neighbourhood![QWERTY123]Dena est une hote à recommander, à la fois suffisament presente pour donner des conseils, et suffisament discrete pour ne pas avoir l impression de ""squatter"" :)[QWERTY123]Our stay at Dena's place was great.
Everything went perfectly well from the booking to the departure and everythings in between. Dena is a very good host, l would recommend  her with no hesitation !
Big Thank you[QWERTY123]Dena was a very nice host and the flat is comfortable. We get also good tips for our trips. Thanks for the nice days dena.[QWERTY123]When my daughter and I planned our trip to NYC Dena was extremely helpful, giving us detailed information about how we would get to her place. We really enjoyed our stay at her apartment in Harlem. She was very kind and helpful again giving us good adice about how to get around and what to do in New York City. Although Dena is a busy person we were lucky enough to spent some time with her talking and laughing. 
Good thing: we've changed our plans and will stay with her again on our way back to Germany. 
Thank you Dena - you really are a superhost![QWERTY123]If you're looking for a place in NYC where you can experience a comfortable stay for an affordable price I would point you here. Dena was very welcoming and communicative before and during our stay. I hadn't explored Harlem before so it was a greag place to be. Also, the subway is not far away to catch a ride down to lower Manhattan. 5/5 stay.[QWERTY123]Dena's apartment was awesome. She is an excellent host and her two cool cats will welcome you as soon as you walk in.

It is located in a main street of culturally-rich Harlem, with delis, cafés and restaurants within a block or two. Metro and buses are also super close, and Central Park is about 20 minutes walking.  Late-night Ubers from Midtown run about $20.

Best experience possible in an Airbnb.


[QWERTY123]The room is great and clean, very close to subway and supermarket. Most importantly the cats is cute.[QWERTY123]An amazing modern home with a host who really shared information and her time to get know the areas we might want to visit.  Dena's place exudes the thriving and lively environmental that makes Harlem famous.  You can trust her advice on the best restuaurants snd places to sightsee.[QWERTY123]I had a great time with Dena, she is super nice and she's always looking that nothing is needed. The  apartment is very spacious, everything is very clean and it's very close to the red line.[QWERTY123]Highly recommend this place for anyone! The location of this home is right outside Central Park and Times Square. It's somewhat low-key since it is further north, but it's still close to your favorite locations here.

The home itself is quiet, peaceful, and very comfortable. Navigating through the home is not complicated at all. 

Overall, we are super satisfied with our experience here![QWERTY123]Overall great AirBnB for the area.[QWERTY123]Dena has a great place in NY.[QWERTY123]Was a nice modern apartment[QWERTY123]Dena es una anfitriona excepcional, todo es acorde a las fotos y a la información entregada por la plataforma. Dena nos permitió quedarnos el último día sin problemas, dado que nuestro vuelo era por la madrugada.[QWERTY123]Dena's place was very clean and comfortable. Very safe location and easy access to supermarket and express trains downtown. We were able to borrow her umbrella for the one rainy day which was nice, as small things like that really add up. Her kitty cats were such a bonus and made our vacation extra special. Highly recommend this host.[QWERTY123]Dena's place is only a couple blocks away from the subway, which made getting around Manhattan a breeze. She is friendly, communicates well and gives great tips on what to check out while in the city. The apartment is fun and cozy and she has two awesome cats that made the stay fun. I enjoyed sipping on a beverage and watching the city come to life down below through the large windows in the living room and bedroom. I hope I didn't feed the cats too much during my stay; they didn't seem to mind. :)[QWERTY123]I loved the area. Harlem is a very special place. The cats were sweet, and the appartment very nice. I was very happy with my stay at Dena's place[QWERTY123]Dena was a very kind and helpful host. She looked up things for us and even printed out tickets for us which we really appreciated! She's a super great cook, so the house smells great which made it feel ""homey"". The bathroom is not easily available from around 7- 8:30, as a couple share the bathroom with the Airbnb guests.  (they are super nice though). I say this because if you have to be somewhere in the morning , it will be hard to have access to the shower and  toilet at that time. Thank goodness we were tourists and would just wait.  The 2 cats are very loving and sweet and they let you pet them and hang out with you.[QWERTY123]Dena was really nice and the location of her house is great! You can get to any famous landmark easily. The cats are so cute and friendly. Highly recommend.[QWERTY123]We loved staying here! Close to every thing you could need and a comfortable home.[QWERTY123]It was a AMAZING stayover and I loved the experience. Definitely a suggestion to all for the stay[QWERTY123]Dana and her place are awesome. Conveniently located near the subway and good restaurants in Harlem is a good option for less crowded streets.
Bed was comfortable, linen clean and clean towels provided. The overall apartment is very nice too, just as pictured! We only had a minor delay a morning when we woke up late and had to wait for the bathroom to be free for us to take a shower.
Dana was incredibly responsive and attentive to our arrival, stay and departure, she was very polite and amenable - it was a very nice stay, definitely recommend.[QWERTY123]un peu loin du centre de la ville mais decouvrir south Harlem est une experience a faire d'autant qu'avec le metro,c'est tres facile.
bel appartement spacieux,chambre correcte, mnque de rangement cependant
salle de bains commune,seule point noir de notre sejour!!!!![QWERTY123]Dena's place is located very close to the subway stations and restaurants.  The area of Harlem is super cool and safe.  Dena and her roommates (cats and human) are very easy going, friendly and gracious.

The space is funky, in a good way and the tips and conversations totally worth it![QWERTY123]Staying at Dena’s place worked out perfect for my friend and I. The place was very nice and clean. The subway was only a few blocks away which helped us get to anywhere in the city. Highly recommend this place to anyway staying in NYC.[QWERTY123]This was my first experience with AirBnb, and to say it was amazing is an understatement. Dena is such a sweetheart (not to mention Gizmo and Tim - her cats), her place is adorable, and a super quick walk to the subway. Will definitely be returning on our next trip![QWERTY123]Lugar inmejorable para conocer Harlem, Gospel y Central Park! Restaurantes muy correctos cerca y facil para ir a pie a los lugares tipicos si os gusta caminar! Dena es una fantastica anfitriona! Thks Dena![QWERTY123]Dena was a great host and so were the Cats, the three of them made us feel like we were at home. Everything is just like you see it on the pictures.[QWERTY123]I would give Dena 6 stars if I could. Not only is Dena's pace great but she is an amazing host and made us feel right at home. Her cats Tim and Gizmo were also lovely and the icing on an already great stay.[QWERTY123]El piso de dena esta increible y ella lo mismo! si buscais algo para pasarla bien este piso es perfecto! buena limpieza y buena hubication! el tema de el baño compartido no pesa para nada... porque es muy limpio y moderno! cia (Phone number hidden by Airbnb)[QWERTY123]Highly recommended everything  and her cat very friendly :)[QWERTY123]We loved staying with Dena. Her place is beautiful and she is so helpful and friendly. Next time we go to New York we will definitely be staying with her![QWERTY123]Dena's place is just as described. It is clean and comfy, with two very friendly cats. Everything was perfect except that it is a little bit far away from the subway.[QWERTY123]We stayed in Dena’s apartment for a week whilst in NYC. Unfortunately there was water damage and holes were cut in the walls of the bedroom, one of which looked through to the lounge room. A shame because the room could have been very nice otherwise. The building itself was secure and in a good location within walking distance to the subway and with some great restaurants close by.[QWERTY123]Es war ein toller Aufenthalt bei Dena. Die Wohnung sieht so wie auf den Bildern aus. Die Katzen sind sehr entspannt. Dena ist die perfekte Gastgeberin und hat super Tips. Wir sind mit ihr zusammen in den showmans Jazz Club. War sehr spaßig.
Ich kann dieses Apartment nur empfehlen.
Ein besseres Preis-Leistungsverhältnis wird man nicht finden. Danke für alles :-*[QWERTY123]Dena is very friendly. Timmy and Gizmo are both very cute and it is a really friendly environment. The neighborhood is not sketchy at all. Recommend.[QWERTY123]Dena is a very helpful host and always solves any of our problems sufficiently. But the bedroom is a little bit small and lack of some necessary items like bedside tables. Another little problem is the cats. They always feel hungry at nights and may come to the bedroom to ask your for food if the host is not at home. The neighborhood is very safe at daytime, but there might be some homeless people asking you for money at night. But overall, it’s a nice house and good experience in NY.[QWERTY123]✅[QWERTY123]I chose Dena's place for its great location right in the middle Harlem and for her cats, who were just as great. Dena was also an attentive and helpful host.[QWERTY123]We couldn't ask for more! 
Dena is amazing! The check-in at the front desk, the welcoming at the house, the tips of what to do and where to go, the comfort of the house, the wonderful bed, the sweetest cats, everything so clean. Me and my friend were welcome in this house like we were friends already. We always felt comfortable, we used the common areas, we used a really nice bathroom, and had both privacy and company as much as we would want.
It was perfect. It is in a nice area, we were cautious and still felt quite safe. The subway is right next to the house, aswell as city bikes. The house is big, the room and the bed also. And the two wonderful cats kept us company. They are very nice and quiet, they don't bother at all, and they still don't let you feel alone in the house. 
Dena and Vanessa were very nice, helpful, and the best company. 
The tips were great! Go check out Paris Blues nearby, they are also welcoming!

Dena responded right away, and helped out with everything we asked for. 
Very simple house rules to follow. 
And such interesting people to meet in the house.
Thank you so much Dena! Definitely the best host!
You won't regret it :) just book the room, you have my word.[QWERTY123]Great location in Harlem,close to subway and night life. Dena was kind and accommodating. The friendly cats welcoming us was a plus;)[QWERTY123]Great location in Harlem, very close to a lot of popular and delicious restaurants.[QWERTY123]Great place to stay while visiting the city! Safe neighborhood and building, two wonderful cats and a nice apartment overall. We would definitely come back again and I reccomend her place to everyone.[QWERTY123]A great location, you’re a bit in retreat from the downtown buzz in an area that has a real community vibe and great transport connections.[QWERTY123]O espaço é exatamente como descrito no anúncio, muito próximo das linhas 2 e 3 de metrô, de um holefoods, Starbucks e outros fastfoods. Dessa linha você tem acesso direto a time square e ao brooklyn.

A rua é cheia de restaurantes muito interessantes e voltados para a cultura local do Harlen. A noite você nota que é muito seguro andar na rua, há varias pessoas, tanto locais como turistas.

Quando chegamos havia um envelope nos aguardando na recepção. Nele havia a chave do apto e uma cartinha da Dena com boas vindas e dicas do apto.

Os gatos são o máximo, super receptivos e companheiros. Quem gosta de gatos vai se apaixonar, quem não gosta, basta deixar a porta do quarto fechada que eles não entram. A casa é limpa e não possui pelos de gatos espalhados.

Dena é um amor de pessoa, muito preocupada se estava tudo bem, e ao mesmo tempo respeitando o nosso espaço nos deixando confortáveis para interagir o quanto nos sentirmos confortáveis. 

Recomendo o local pois é aconchegante e de fácil acesso ao metrô."	40.80919824451595	-73.94420996399346	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/25696	2	100.0	0.86
91	12318	"cynthia is one of the most reliable host in airbnb. i had a bad experience with host Anya Babbit( who advertised a beautiful apt n accepted our booking but cancelled 3 days before my arrival in NY)i was terribly stressed and would have been left terribly stranded with my daughter in NY if not for Cynthia who responded quickly to our email and reservation and arrange for taxi service as well at the airport. 

very helpful and nice person...will not hesitate to rec her to anyone looking for a place to stay in NY...[QWERTY123]Great place conveniently located next to subway, restaurants, and bars. Thank you Cynthia for all your help and I hope to see you in the near future. Cheers[QWERTY123]A great experience living the life of a true New Yorker for a week with Cynthia as guide.  The West Side retreat was a wonderful location, near subway, bus, and museums.  Room with bath was fine if a bit short of drawer space.  The setting was quiet and well appointed.[QWERTY123]My stay was delightful. Cynthia met me at the appointed time and showed me the lay out. Cynthia is an interesting and out going person. The apartment in a classic nyc . It had high ceiling and had all the needed comforts. It was great to be a few steps from Riverside Drive Park and just two blocks from the subway. Everything was clean and thoughtfully done. I will sray there again by choice[QWERTY123]Our stay in Cynthia's WEST SIDE RETREAT was a wonderful NYC experience.  The  Upper West Side apartment is beautiful, a work of Art Deco splendor.  Close to subway and busses and lots of restaurants in all price ranges.

Our hostess in the apartment was gracious and accomodating, sharing a treasure trove of ideas and experiences.  And Cynthia herself could not have been more helpful in establishing us in her friend's place as well as being at our beck and call and making us feel very secure in the Big Apple.

We would definitely return to this UWS fabulous abode.  My wife's dream-- after living in NYC almost fifty years ago-- was to live in one of the apartments in the 80's near West End and Riverside Drive, with a door-man and an elevator no less!  Thanks for making that dream come true for four days![QWERTY123]I stayed at the spot off 86th.  Awesome location -just 2 blocks away from the subway station and walking distance from many places to eat, shop, and sightsee.  The bedroom was super spacious and it was definitely nice to have my own bathroom.  Ronette and Cynthia  were extremely nice and made me feel welcome during my stay.  I'd definitely consider staying there again.[QWERTY123]We had a very good time at the West Side Retreat. It's a great location, & we loved the host's balance between recommending, treating us & letting us have our own experience. Now we know what it's like to live on the Upper West Side. Thank you for being the perfect host, all those ten days![QWERTY123]I stayed at the West Side Retreat, and this was my best Airbnb stay yet.  The room and private bath off West 86th Street felt like a penthouse to me. I've never lived in a building with a doorman, and both of the doormen are so sweet and helpful.  The private room is double the size of any hotel room I've ever booked in New York, and the bath is also spacious.  The bed was comfy and there is a rack with hangars so you can easily hang up several outfits.  One reason I have to go back will be to check out Riverside Park because this trip I was focused on activities in Central Park (a bus or subway ride away unless you have time to walk it).  The location is just about a block from a bus stop and two blocks from a subway station.
Riverside Park looked lovely from a block away and everyone tells me that it is a wonderful green treasure in NYC.  This was the first time I've stayed in New York and felt like I could live there.  For the most part, it was like having my own apartment.  The only possible improvement would be a short guide to the neighborhood with Ronette or Cynthia's favorite places for coffee or a light bite.  Since I had my iPhone and Yelp at hand, however, I was fine without it.  Ronette does supply a Zagat guide, but I always prefer first hand recommendations.

I had the opportunity to see Cynthia's place on 97th St. and it truly is a work of art.  If you don't mind sharing a bath and want to lodge in an evolving living space that celebrates creativity, the 97th St. spot would be my recommendation.  For me, I loved all the space I had at the West Side Retreat.[QWERTY123]A home away from home at West Side Retreat!  Thank you so much to Ronnette and Cynthia for your hospitality and being there for us and taking care of booking a car for us to the airport at 5am!  The bedroom is very spacious and comfortable and it was great having our own bathroom.  We hope that the apartment will be available for our next visit to NYC as it is just perfect for our needs.  Thanks also to Cynthia for inviting us to dinner with your friends.  It was great fun!  Thankyou both for making us so welcome.
Charla & Chris[QWERTY123]yes. and yes. it's a treat. indeed. just like downtown and then some.[QWERTY123]NA[QWERTY123]Cynthia was abroad during my stay, so Ronnette did the honors. She's a delightful conversationalist, and we shared our love of architecture (she's a pro; I'm a fan). It did mean fixing your own breakfast with the available fixin's.
     The place is a gem, built in 1909 when they knew how to build luxury apartments (condos came later): big rooms, high ceilings, hardwood trimmings, etc. Ronnette is spearheading modernization, starting with a zippy elevator; she's leaving the marble foyer in all its old glory. Fortunately utilities are up to contemporary standards. (I've owned and upgraded a San Francisco victorian, so I know the pitfalls.)
     Can't beat the price, location, privacy, ambience and hostess. Highly recommended!
     Karl[QWERTY123]I booked the West Side Retreat for an initial 3 days and ended up staying for two weeks. Top-notch accommodation with the most gracious host I've ever met during my travels. My new favorite spot in town.[QWERTY123]Great apartment and was made very welcome In a great area. Just a short cab ride to time square and all the other sites. Will recommend to others in australia Thanks for letting us stay[QWERTY123]Fabulous apartment with your own bathroom and lovely room. Didn't meet Ronette until my last night which was a shame as she was delightful. Great location, apartment and host.I would like to live there! Anna[QWERTY123]I really enjoyed my stay at the Westside Retreat. Everything was planned really well and the apartment owner was lovely. I would definitely stay at one of Cynthia's places again. Thank you.[QWERTY123]Just returned to Oz.  Westside  retreat was such a pleasant surprise, a great introduction to NY. Cynthia and her friend were such hospitable and friendly hosts. Nothing was too much trouble for them and help and advise was always at hand. Many hours of great chat were had. Joy and I highly recommend Cynthia as a wonderful host, THANKYOU so much.
Swen and Joy
[QWERTY123]My stay at Upper West Side Retreat was more than I could have hoped for. Warmly welcomed by Cynthia and graciously hosted by Ronnette, I felt very comfortable. Ronnette's apartment is a purist's art deco delight. The location is wonderful..just a walk across Central Park to Museum Mile, the room is large, extremely comfortable and has everything you need; having your own bathroom and use of the kitchen is a plus. Morning conversations with Ronnette were always interesting; she was extremely helpful and provided insights into many aspects of New York. I appreciated the opportunity to stay here and would highly recommend it. Thank you so much Ronnette and Cynthia.[QWERTY123]I had a wonderful stay and could highly recommend visiting the apartment . Felt as if i was among old friends would most definitly return. A big thank you Alison[QWERTY123]We cannot begin to tell you how wonderful our visit to West Side Retreat was!  EVERYTHING was truly magical and above all WE WERE NOT STAYING IN A RIP OFF HOTEL!! The location was EXCELLENT, facilities in the apartment were like a home from home, it was like staying with FAMILY in New York!  I hate cities, but New York was made truly magical by the comfort and true feeling of security not to mention the fantastic address that the West Side Retreat offered.  Thanks so much for all your kindness, consideration and hospitality during our stay - please do not hesitate to send any queries from future potential guests to us, we will have NO PROBLEM highly recommending you!!  We will also pass on the word to ALL our friends and family visiting New York.  We will DEFINITELY hope to return on our next trip to the city![QWERTY123]I thought both Cynthia Karella and Ronnette (where I stayed)were absolutely excellent.  They were welcoming, interesting and I enjoyed meeting both of them.  The accommodations and location were perfect. Regards, Marc Rosenberg (Phone number hidden by Airbnb)[QWERTY123]The room was lovely, and the building people were nice and helpful.  I enjoyed my stay very much.
Cynthia was very responsive--she answered my questions immediately, and I enjoyed my experience.
I would definitely consider staying here again.

[QWERTY123]Enjoyed my stay very much--the room was large, comfortable and attractive.  Had my own bathroom,
access to kitchen and TV.  Would definitely recommend it to a friend--owner was very nice and accommodating.
Thank you, Cynthia.  Yours, Sima[QWERTY123]in busy december 2010, I stayed in Cynthia's cosy apartment, located in a convenient doorman building,  for six nights; I also  had a great time, meeting with her and some of her interesting friends. Cynthia is a charming and easy going person I will meet again with pleasure on  future trips in NYC. She is able to help you around with any type of questions one may have! thanks Cynthia for allowing me to stay with you..! best to you, Madeleine[QWERTY123]This is accomodation at it's best in New York. A gorgeous apartment in the Upper West, with private bed and bathroom. Ease to subway and buses. Great shops just around the corner. Cynthia is an extraordinary host you have to meet and share your dreams in the big apple![QWERTY123]It´s a good place just as describe. People are nice.[QWERTY123]I had a very nice week in New-York and appreciated beeing at Ronnette's appartment. It was clean, and I had my own bathroom. I could make meals at the apparment which helped to save money. It was near the subway (2 blocks) and I could go home at night feeling completely safe. I will keep the address !

Hélène (30/04/2011 to 08/05/2011)[QWERTY123]We appreciated Cynthia's rapid response to our query and her efficient and hospitable confirmation.  
The apartment is well located, spacious and quiet; the doormen were very pleasant.  Ronnette is a delightful hostess, whose schedule was compatable with ours and made for an easy sharing of the apartment.
We will keep it on our list of places to stay in NYC and especially recommend it to former Westsiders.[QWERTY123]The West Side Retreat has Location! Location! Location!. Only five minutes from times square and fifteen minutes from South Ferry for Statue of Liberty and Elllis Island cruises, on the number one subway line located close by. This apartment is very handy for the New York tourist with grocery/ pharmacy shops etc close by in West End. I managed to take a good bite out of the big apple. Thanks fo5r having me.[QWERTY123]Cynthia was a caring and considerate host who went out of her way to make my stay enjoyable. Would recommend.[QWERTY123]Really nice location, clean and comfortable.. near to the subway, I really liked the district too. Cynthia and Ronette are wonderful hosts ! Advisable place indeed .[QWERTY123]Our trip to New York was more about finding a location that was near our son who lives on West 69th than it was about amenities so the location on West 86th was fine.  

We were only concerned about having a clean bed and bathroom since most of our time would be spent with him outside of these accommodations.  It met those requirements.

I guess we thought the room and bath were a separate entity but it is actually a room and bath that is within the apartment of the owner.  It was like having a separate entity since we very rarely saw the owner.

You can have access to the owner's kitchen  and living room if so desired and there is a coin-operated laundry in the basement.

The owner was very accommodating and went out of her way to get us information on theater tickets.[QWERTY123]What a place. Staying Upper West Side in a nice apartment with own bed room and separate bathroom just two blocks from the next Metro station. Cynthia and Ronette are wonderful hosts and I will for sure stay there again the next time I come to Manhattan. Thanks again for giving me the feeling of being a New Yorker![QWERTY123]Wonderful Upper Westside location. Warm and welcoming host and environment. I would definitely hope to stay here again! 
[QWERTY123]My stay at Ronnette's house was wonderful and my host was so kind and helpful for everything as I thought we were friends for a long time... We were very happy and will come back surely! 

Pour les Français, ou les francophones: 

"" Un séjour dans le merveilleux appartement de Ronette et Cynthia vous fera encore mieux apprécier le temps que vous passerez à New York. Nous y étions comme chez nous, avec une propriétaire passionnante et chaleureuse, au milieu du charme et du confort de son installation et dans le plus joli quartier de New york. Allez-y, les yeux fermés, vous ne le regretterez pas.[QWERTY123]West Side Retreat is aptly named. A convenient and quiet location with a very congenial, interesting host. This is an excellent option for a stay in New York, based in the heart of the wonderful Upper West Side with easy access to all New York's attractions. Highly recommend![QWERTY123]we had a great stay at the west side retreat. the apartment is spacious by nyc standards and the location is ideal with good food, the subway and riverside park all within a couple of blocks. we would definitely go back.
thanks -[QWERTY123]I had a fantastic stay with Roni and Cynthia was so helpful and clear in helping me navigate from the airport to the Upper West Side. The home was clean, charming and located in a very safe neighborhood with easy access to the subway and tasty restaurants. I felt totally comfortable coming and going throughout the day. Would definitely stay here again and will recommend this place to my friends. Thank you for the bath salts for my bath...all that walking took a toll on my toes./ Bobbie[QWERTY123]This is in a great area of New York – far from the zaniness of Times Square; but a 15 minute ride by subway ride gets you there if you want the theatre... You are about a 5 minute walk to the subway from the West Side Retreat. There are plentiful restaurants of all types near-by. Central Park is 10 minutes away. And do visit Riverside Park, it’s just down the block and a beautiful park to relax in.

West Side is great for one or two people – the bed is a double bed. It’s very quiet. There’s plenty of room in addition to your own bedroom – you can use there living room and there is a kitchen (but I hardly used it). You have your own bathroom as well.
[QWERTY123]Ronnette was really helpful. She made my stay extremely comfortable in her lovely home. The apartment is conveniently located close to the subway with lots of good restaurants and convenience stores nearby. Would recommend Roni's place to anyone wanting to stay in Manhattan. Thanks Roni for the grand tour of your office with the wonderful views. Hope to see you soon either in NYC or in Delhi :-). Thanks Cynthia for connecting me and Ronnette and also for all the helpful info you sent via email. Hope to meet you the next time I am in NYC (hope you had a great time in Italy). 
[QWERTY123]This is a wonderful location.  A very quiet residence with a large comfortable bedroom and private bathroom just outside the bedroom.  Very clean and well equipped.  i loved the security of having a doorman and well secured doors to the apartment.

The kitchen is perfectly equipped.

The host is available for questions and otherwise you have your privacy.  I highly recommend this lovely place.[QWERTY123]This is a GREAT place to stay. It's on the Upper West Side. It's a only a few minutes to the subway. There are plentiful and various restaurants nearby. It's a  15 minute walk to Central Park (a New York must see). Also well worth a visit, is peaceful Riverside Park just down the street.

The West Side Retreat is my number 1 choice when visiting New York! It's a quiet and a wonderful location. It meets all my requirements. Everything is nearby!

Cynthia keeps guests well informed and answers any questions promptly (not that I had many).[QWERTY123]This was my first time using this service and I was rather nervous to be honest however Cynthia was fantastic. She replied to my emails in a timely manner, everything was how she explained it would be. The room was clean, comfortable, very spacious and I will most certainly be staying there on my future trips. I highly recommend this choice. The perfect location too.[QWERTY123]A great place to stay.  A lovely large room fronting the street, with glimpses of the Hudson and Riverside Park, and an adjoining private bathroom.  Ronnette’s apartment is charming, and in a lovely building.  The location is great and you can very quickly get around NY, with the subway only a two minute walk along the street, and buses around the corner.  The area has an abundance of great cafes/restaurants/delis etc, particularly around the corner on Broadway and Amsterdam.   Although I was visiting as a tourist, I liked the area because it is not a tourist district.
Cynthia was a delight to deal with when arranging my stay.  Ronnette is a great host, but unfortunately our paths hardly crossed, as we were both coming and going. She is very interesting, and I would have liked to get to know her more.
I would definitely like to return.
[QWERTY123]Very clean room. Private bath.  Never met Ronnette.  Class ""A"" prewar condo.  She worked late every night.  Only criticism I have is the room is cluttered with knick knacks and there is no unused closet or dresser space so I had to keep my things in the suitcase.[QWERTY123]Cynthia and her sister Ronnette are very gracious hosts. Cynthia was in Italy and called me personaly to make sure that I was going to get settled in without any problems. I never saw Ronnette ( like having a live-in ghost who made sure I was always comfortable). She even left NyQuil our for me when I was coughing one night from my asthma. I was so gald she din't throw me out thinking I had the plague. Also she let me store my bags till after check out on Tuesday so that I could do all the paperwork on my new appartment. before I left that afternoon. The digs are great and they opened up some closet space. It right on Riverside Park just minutes to the subway. Very safe, has a doorman. 
If there is better you will not find it.

New Orleans[QWERTY123]Ronnette's place is a real ""haven of rest"" and close to all NY's facilities explorers may
need (bus, subway, shops, restaurants, bars). 
Besides across the street past Riverside Park and 4 blocks away there is the STUNNING Central Park.
The room is clean and very
comfortable. Ronnette is a nice and friendly host and Cynthia was really
efficient to organize my arrival. Thanks all of you for making my first stay in
NY so pleasant.
Thank you Roni for your kind message. Don't worry I will be back in NY and we will see each other soon !

F.[QWERTY123]Had a great time at Ronnette's place. Cynthia responded quickly to my inquiries even though she was out of the country! The apartment exudes old world charm, filled with many decorative arts and art work. The bed was very comfortable, and the kitchen well equipped and modern. A nice feature is that guests have their own bathroom adjacent to bedroom. There's also cable TV in the bedroom. Ronnette is a very engaging, amenable host, but works long hours, so you often have the place to yourself. Conveniently located near 86th St Subway stop and only a few blocks from Zabar's deli.[QWERTY123]This was my first experience with airbnb and I was lucky. The apartment is beautiful. It is also very clean. The location in the Upper West Side is my favorite in NYC. The presence of a doorman makes it feel safe. Ronnette is very busy and you will not see her much. But if you do, she is smart and fun. Cynthia was very patient with all my requests of informations and quickly available to respond to each of them. It is a friendly place.[QWERTY123]I had a guest who visited New York this past week.  He was hosted by Cynthia.  My guest was very pleased.  The room was very clean, attractively decorated and comfortable.  The private bathroom was nicely appointed.  He received sufficient towels and soap products during his stay.  He was also pleased with the location of the apartment and its proximity to public transportation.  My guest enjoys attending concerts and  opera at Lincoln Center which was easily accessible from the apartment.  This is the first time I use airbnb and was extremely pleased with the experience.  I would certainly hope to be able to have access to this  apartment when other guests visit me in NYC.[QWERTY123]The accommodations were very much as represented and
very satisfactory. The bed was comfortable, the temperature
agreeable and the kitchen was very good. The neighborhood is
wonderful with subway and buses close by, all kinds of stores and the most luxurious movie theatre in New York with business class
like reclining seats, 3D and bookable seats (AMC 8th and B'way). We would definitely stay there again. The apartment is crowed with
things, especially china and stacks of newspapers but they do not
interfere with our activities.[QWERTY123]Being a native New Yorker, my one desire was to be able to experience living on the Upper Westside. Well  fortunately my first experience was at this wonderful apartment where I felt most welcomed. The accommodations were perfect. The room and private (Website hidden by Airbnb) could not ask for more. The location was great. The subway was 2 blocks away. Access to shopping was right around the corner. The hostess was welcoming and available. Thank you.[QWERTY123]First off, it's a pretty large bedroom and the picture doesn't do it justice. The apartment is lovely with all sorts of art and artifacts. And the kitchen was perfect for my purposes.
The host was very accommodating and easy to contact.
The location is great: just yards away from the park on Riverside Drive and two short blocks to Broadway and all its shops and restaurants. I'd stay here again.[QWERTY123]Ronnette was a nice host. She is very busy so we met only 2 times I think, but she set up everything to make me feel like at home : the bedroom is very large, everything was clean, and I had my own bathroom ! She was also nice to let me check out on evening to catch my plane. The location is splendid near Riverside, Broadway and Central park : I like this place ![QWERTY123]My stay at Cynthia's home was great. It was my first time that I booked via airbnb and I did not regret it. I had a huge room (two persons would have enough space; there is also a desk in case you have to work, a TV) and a private bathroom. The room itself was really nice (much nicer than in the picture). Everything was clean. There were enough towels. I could also use the kitchen (e.g., refrigerator). I met my host once in person. She was very nice. Moreover, the location is quite good - the 1 train is 5 minutes away on foot.
To sum it up - this is an excellent accommodation (better than any Hilton hotel in NY)! I would book it again.[QWERTY123]Ronnette's room is in a Great (Website hidden by Airbnb) is easy to everywhere in Manhattan by Metro and bus.Cynthia with Ronnette are easy for communication and quick response.They make us like at home.Definitely I will stay  here again when I am in NYC.Thanks Ronnette for all of the preparation and guideline for food,sightseeing and traffic.We are enjoy staying.[QWERTY123]It's very confortable to stay in Ronnette's (Website hidden by Airbnb) is very busy   and she always leave the space for us as freedom.Even we couldn't talk each other this time.We are feeling that stay in home.Cynthia has fast response for question and support.I have a pleasure journey.Thanks Cynthia and Ronnette.[QWERTY123]If I return to New York, I will arrange my vacation dates around the availability of Cynthia's West Side Retreat.  I don't ever want to stay anyplace else in Manhattan!  It was awesome![QWERTY123]This place was absolutely perfect for me.  The room and the apartment are gorgeous, as is the neighborhood; my bathroom small but very well-appointed.  Because of her very demanding job, I didn't actually meet my host until the last evening of my stay (when we ended up talking into the wee hours:).  There was a helpful pamphlet with all necessary information and  we communicated via written notes.  The one time there was a problem she responded constructively within 20 minutes.  For those who need more hand-holding in regards to functioning in NYC, this might be a bit daunting; but as said, for me, it was perfect and I look very much forward to returning very soon![QWERTY123]Cynthia's place was ideal for staying when visiting my daughter in NYC.
The room was bright and comfortable with the bathroom just beside.
Unfortunately I never got the opportunity to meet the hostess.[QWERTY123]The neighborhood is great, good restaurants and bars. The host made us feel very welcome in her house and the room is very comfortable.[QWERTY123]This is my second time there. One of my favorite places to stay. Bedroom is big and the bed is comfy. Love the way the apartment looks. Your own bathroom too and nice kitchen facilities. Great host.[QWERTY123]This was my first AirBnb experience and my first trip to the city and I wasn't quite sure what to expect. But, Cyn and Roni made the experience a pleasant and smooth one and I had a great time staying here. The room is large and having your own private bathroom is a great perk. Kitchen is available for use whenever you need it which is great. The neighborhood is pleasant and can be surprisingly quiet which is nice to come home to after along day. Cyn and Roni both communicated very quickly and made sure I had what I needed to enjoy my stay. Would definitely recommend to others looking for a place to stay in the city.[QWERTY123]I really appreciate the opportunity to utilize the UWS Retreat.  That is exactly what it ended up being for me. Traveling to NYC for business, it was nice to have a place to relax and recharge in between meetings. Thank you so much for your hospitality![QWERTY123]La chambre correspond bien aux photos, elle est vaste et confortable  mais manque un peu d'espace de rangements ( surtout pour un séjour de 3 semaines). L'arrivée était bien organisée. L'appartement est bien équipé, le quartier est très agréable, bien desservi par les transports en commun ( métro, bus ), tout près d'un grand parc au bord de l'Hudson, avec de nombreux commerces à proximité.  Dommage que je n'aie pas pu rencontrer Ronnette, mais j'ai passé un très bon séjour et j'espère revenir chez elle lors de mon prochain passage à New York[QWERTY123]Great location, comfortable bed, very nice host[QWERTY123]This place is great; right near the subway and pretty easy to navigate. Our host was very welcoming and gave us great suggestions and tips on how to get around. Overall, great experience.[QWERTY123]Clean when I arrived but no plans by host to clean the bathroom and replace linen after the first week of my two week stay.
Wifi is extremely slow - slow to load pictures and don't even bother with movies like youtube. Host is already aware of this but didn't seem to have any plans to improve it.
Otherwise it's a charming old world apartment in a good location close to subway station and walking distance to many Manhattan attractions.[QWERTY123]My stay at Ronnette's place has been absolutely perfect. Both Cynthia and Ronnette are two extremely kind women, who respect your privacy but also make you feel at home.
I arrived at Ronnette's after having a bad experience with other accommodations, but luckily I had the chance to spend a week in this beautiful and perfectly located apartment. 
The only problem that you might encounter is the internet connection. It works most of the time, but it may be off during bad weather. 
I will definitely suggest this place to my friends![QWERTY123]Beautiful. Love the art![QWERTY123]Stay was just as expected. Nice neighborhood, close to subway, comfortable room and private bathroom.[QWERTY123]Fabulous location, large private room with comfortable bed and private bathroom."	40.790093746567145	-73.97926932390199	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/12318	2	135.0	0.875

Jessica did everything to make our stay pleasant and enjoyable, including leaving walking guides, transit info, and recommended lists of local shops and eateries.

My only caveat might be for older people who are unable to manage stairs easily since the bedrooms and main bathroom are on the second floor.  It was not problem for us.

Even though it was HOT HOT HOT in the city, we are all in love with Brooklyn and hope to repeat our experience at Jessica's house at some future, cooler time.

We DEFINITELY recommend this lovely place![QWERTY123]Es un lugar muy tranquilo, tienes el metro cerca, supermercados, restaurantes,...
El adosado está muy bien, es bastante grande.[QWERTY123]Jessica's house is a wonderful place, welcoming, calm, perfectly located. Jessica was nice and gave all the necessary information well in advance.  We had a great time there and would have loved to stay longer. We strongly recommend her place, especially for a family, and will definitely go back next time we visit NYC![QWERTY123]Spacious, comfortable townhouse with full amenities and wonderful kitchen and dining area. This house is great for family traveling to New York for a brief period of time.[QWERTY123]My family and I stayed at this lovely apartment in Brooklyn for a week during the summer and had a wonderful stay. It was perfect for our two kids two who enjoyed the toys and bunk beds and the new garden set up with the swings. The apartment is lovely and light and airy and the kitchen is a real highlight. It's located at a perfect spot to explore brooklyn as well as near the subway to go into manhattan. Jessica was so helpful with all her tips and leaving lots of maps and information about the local area, and very flexible generally so I would highly recommend this great apartment to anyone![QWERTY123]Jessica's home was like our home away from home. Despite being winter, when the sun did shine Jessica's home was truly a sunny townhouse. It is a great house in a good location close to wonderful shops, cafes, restaurants, a cinema and parks. We ""lived as locals"" in Brooklyn. A short walk to the subway made Manhattan easily accessible for us. We could not have asked for anything better and thank Jessica for her hospitality.[QWERTY123]Wonderful townhouse in a great neighborhood. We loved the subway access and all the toys for our kids. The kitchen is to die for and we ate meals on the back patio almost every night.[QWERTY123]Great place!  Rented for our daughter's wedding that took place at The Green Building which is just a couple of blocks away.  Three bedroom with a big kitchen and nice deck and backyard which was great with a the family comings-and-goings associated with the wedding. Well-represented online.  Subway stop for F train into Manhattan was  just a few blocks away too. Plenty of shops, restaurants and a Whole Foods nearby.  I'd recommend.[QWERTY123]Everything was fine. We were travvelling with two kids and they were more than pleased to find eveything to play with. Brooklyn is an excellent place to visit both hectic Manhattan and relaxed parts as Coeney island or Park Slope[QWERTY123]Jessica was very helpful and accessible.  The neighborhood and entire location was great.  Easy access to pretty much everything.  We definitely appreciated staying there.  The home was also excellent.  Our kids really enjoyed it there.  Very kid friendly and welcoming.[QWERTY123]We absolutely loved this place: Jessica's descriptions turned out to be accurate, not overstated at all, both regarding the place itself, as well as how well it is situated in Brooklyn, and easy it is to get around (we stayed for 6 days). My family (wife and 3 teenagers) had never been to the United States, nonetheless it turned out to be the best leg of our 5 state trip this year. We did not require a lot of interaction with Jessica, but in every case she responded quickly and adequately, and her recommendations for getting around were very useful. I would recommend this place to anyone.[QWERTY123]Wonderful stay! Perfect for our little family and for hosting some delicious brunches in the open kitchen.Neighborhood is amazing with so much to offer. Thank you Jess!!![QWERTY123]Jessica and Joe’s home is a lovely oasis in the big city. It is exactly as described and even more. The house is lovely, furnished in a cosy way and there is even enough space for five adults. It really felt like home. We are very grateful that Jessica and her family shared their home with us. You’ll find everything you need in the house. The kitchen is spacey, the heart of the house, and the deck is a nice bonus — something you won’t find easily in a big city. The house is near Smith street and there you’ll find both a metro station and lovely mini-city kind of feeling with different restaurants enough for one week. All the arrangements went just as agreed and we got responses to our emails right away. An absolutely great place![QWERTY123]Wonderful house, very clean and with Everything you need. The neighborhood is very nice, and you have subway to go everywhere in 15/20 minutes. I would recommend it[QWERTY123]The house was lovely and had a welcoming atmosphere. My children felt immediately at home and found the lego within minutes. The bedrooms were comfortable ( although the airconditioning units were a bit noisy) and kitchen was perfect. The house was everything we hoped it would be, and was impeccably tidy and clean upon arrival. Its location is great, with gorgeous restaurants and shops only 2-3 blocks away. The subway is a 7 minute walk away. We enjoyed our stay very much and will surely recommend Jessica's place to other families. I won't hesitate to come back here when next in New York.[QWERTY123]Jessica's house is a perfekt place to stay in NYC. Only a few minutes after our arrival we felt at home. The house is very good equipped and we loved having breakfast on the terrace. The neighborhood is good, we very much enjoyed the dining and shopping tipps provided by Jessica. I can truly recommend Jessica's place. Especially, families with children will love it.[QWERTY123]Jessica was very welcoming and helpful when I met her to pick up keys to her apartment.  Additionally, she provides a full write-up about the house and places to eat and so forth in the neighborhood.  Her home is sunny and very comfortable.  It is also filled with fun things to look at including her husband's art.  There is a really nice outdoor space and a surprise sculpture that added to our enjoyment.  We were a group of 5 and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay and wouldn't hesitate to come back.  I highly recommend this place.[QWERTY123]Jessica was a pleasure to work with - she's incredibly responsive, great communicator, down to earth, and her place is beautiful.  Definitely recommended![QWERTY123]The host canceled this reservation 160 days before arrival.

93	26362	"I stayed at this location for 7 nights and I was extremely happy with everything.  Cleber is a genuinely nice guy who makes you feel at home the minute you walk through the door, (in fact he even left out magazines for me which he thought would be of interest).  The apartment is a bit small (like most of them in NYC) but that was not a problem.  Above all it is very well located and is clean, warm, secure and quiet.  That is why I think it is good value for money.

I think the highest compliment I can give this place is that I would definitely go back next time I'm in NY.

Thanks Cleber for making my stay so easy and comfortable.

Hemal[QWERTY123]Great host, was easy to deal with and made me very welcome. Great place to stay and very central to everything you would want to check out when visiting NY, a/c was amazing. Cheers[QWERTY123]I stayed with Cleber for 6 nights.  The apt is very central close to Penn Station.  Cleber was a great host.  Friendly, helpful and not intrusive.  I had my own room with a flat TV and aircon.  The place is VERY clean.  Really enjoyed my stay and one of the BEST value stays in NYC!!!  thanks Cleber.[QWERTY123]Staying with Cleber was a great experience. His apartment was accurately represented and Cleber is a wonderful host, providing enlightening conversation and tasty food too. He made the best beams and rice I've had! I would stay again for sure, thanks Cleber[QWERTY123]we had the best time ever, the place was great clean bud a little smalle , bud most of the time we where not there.
the host was a great guy , we even went out for dinner and a drink

the place is nearby everything zo that was great
we did get a metrocard that was a good thing because we would walkt to far away.[QWERTY123]Cleber was a very welcoming host and everything was as described. It's a bit of a pain having to go out of the apartment to use the toilet, but that was in the description so I can have no complaints. Overall, very handy location and the air con DOES work[QWERTY123]The host canceled my reservation 11 days before arrival.[QWERTY123]The location is great! Walking (short) distance to subways, bus stations, times square, Macys...
The apartment is just like Cleber discribed on airbnb; nice bedroom, with tv, AC, good sized bed and a wardrobe to keep things organized.
Besides that Cleber is a great host. Can give tips and directions because knows NYC very well. Also is a good guy to talk about general subjects.
I surely would stay there again and strongly recomend.[QWERTY123]Enjoyed staying here - very easy to go there from airport, and - when visiting different places in NY - you could walk there or use subway.  Also liked that the wireless internet was fast and stable. Cleber was very kind, made sure everything is OK, and gave some tips as well. Thanks![QWERTY123]Bien por Cleber que habla español!!!! fue de mucha ayuda, el departamento siempre limpio y ordenado, en una zona tranquila de la ciudad. Me sentí muy comoda en su departamento.[QWERTY123]I was a bit apprehensive as this was my first use of Airbnb. I chose Cleber and his place to stay because of the location and was not disappointed .Cleber was also flexible with the check -in time which was tremendously helpful as I flew in to NYC at dawn.

Cleber’s apartment is really what we can see on Airbnb photos session. No distortion no misrepresentation.- it is indeed 5 minutes walk from Times Square and other significant NYC landmarks and 1 minute walk to major bus and subway hub (Port Authority Bus Station).  
 
He kept the place spotless clean which impressed me, was safe  and Cleber was a very hospitable host. 

Definitely  recommend this  place to stay .Very good value for money, internet is fast, with great AC, good sized bed, a wardrobe, and in general a very comfortable apartment with tasteful art and nice decoration. His place is perfect for tourists. It's really a great place to stay. Thanks Cleber!

[QWERTY123]Had a great time staying at Cleber's place. Excellent location within close walking distance to Times Square and subway. The apartment was clean and safe. Highly recommend to anyone looking for great place to stay.[QWERTY123]My flight was delayed on the day i arrived so instead of 6pm it was 1am.  Cleber wasnt there but made it really easy for me to get the key and get in.  Place was compact in true ny fashion, but very clean and had all the basics i needed.  Was easy to get around from the location.  Cleber checked in with me by text during my stay to make sure all was well and I met him on the last night.  Very nice guy, would stay here again.[QWERTY123]Cleber is the nicest guy that you'll ever meet.  Whatever your needs are, he will take care of them.  The apt is in perfect location of central manhattan where you can walk to everything.  The place is clean, safe and user-friendly.  My overall experience was an A+, thanks to Cleber!!![QWERTY123]I Had a perfect time staying at Cleber's apartment. Best location, close of port of authority and  walking distance to subway and Times Square. The room was clean and safe. I leave my value stuffs in room all time, and no problem at all....

It's near to a lot of stores, and just to blocks big eletronic shop.

[QWERTY123]I ended up arriving late in to NYC due to lost luggage on my flight. Cleber was gracious enough to let me in later than originally planned, without any fuss or bother. 

Cleber was able to provide me with local knowledge of the Hell's Kitchen area which was also great, and we even spent an evening chatting away over a few drinks sharing stories of our past.

The apartment is conveniently located just blocks from Times Square; and is also just a few blocks from the Megabus stop, which I found very convenient at 6am on a Friday morning!

The apartment itself is clean and very accommodating. The bedding provided was more than comfortable, with a wardrobe to hang my weary clothes at the end of a long Manhattan day.

I had a great stay with Cleber and would happily recommend him to anyone else, be it travelling alone or as a couple.

Thank you Cleber :D[QWERTY123]Cleber is a great host, invisable yet easy to reach. No problem getting in, you can't get lost. Minimum of what you need is there. Place is clean, nice, and you really get what you see and what you paid for. Place is VERY small, like in the mids of Paris. A bit noisy because it's in the big City that ""never sleeps"". If you are looking for bigger place with a doorman - get ready to pay at least $250 per night. Thank you Cleber! I love NY :)[QWERTY123]Cleber is a very good host. His apartment is small but clean and in a very convenient location, literally minutes to Times Square. As I was traveling standby my time of arrival was changed  several times and Cleber was very flexible and helpful in this respect.
Only downside is there is no elevator so if your bag is heavy its a struggle up one flight of stairs.
I would highly recommend this as a place to stay.[QWERTY123]Cleber was incredibly accommodating and helpful.  The apartment has two rooms separated by a clean/comfortable kitchen and bathroom.  One room is larger and the other smaller - both are well kept and have enough reasonable space for travellers. The actual toilet is in a separate room down the hall and did not present an issue.

The location is central and walking distance to many city sights. I would highly recommend staying at Cleber's Times Square cozy.[QWERTY123]Cleber and Gisela were nice host.
I had a wonderful stay in NY. 
It's a nice apartment and clean but bit small for me. 
This is a convenient location with access to any where in NY.
Check-in is smooth and they have showy landmark there to make it easy to find it.I recommend this apartment in NY!  Thank you![QWERTY123]Cleber and his friend, Gisella, provided me with a absolutely wonderful visit. They really went out of their way to make me comfortable and welcome.

 You can't beat the location. Their are  tons on fine restaurants right here on 9th avenue. It is also  a couple blocks from Javits, so it worked great for my visit. 

  The apartment is clean and Gisella made sure I had fresh towels and linens when I arrived.

  I hope to see you guys again some day. Thanks so much. 

Matt

[QWERTY123]When I stayed at this apartment, Cleber was out of town so his friend Gisela checked me in. I arrived very late in the evening (around 11pm) and Gisela was very flexible with my check-in. She is a great hostess, giving me information and going all the way to make sure I have what I need. The apartment is clean and tidy, the internet is fast and stable. Everything is like what is shown in the listing. There is a wardrobe, TV and a good size bed. The hot water in the bathroom is steady. Going to the restroom in the middle of the night may be a bit of a hassle as it is located outside, but it is mentioned in the listing so I have no complain. Besides, the restroom is kept super clean. The area is safe and close to everything -- Time Square, Port authority bus terminal/subway and the theatres. The museums and central park is just a few subway stops away. I travel alone and felt safe when I walked back alone after midnight.  If you are into broadway shows like I do, this is definitely the place to stay as you can walk home after the show. There are many good restaurants nearby, and a 24 hours grocery store is just a block away. If you are only staying in New York for a few days like I did, this is definitely the place to stay at. Its convenient location will save you lots of time. Plus, being so close to the shops, you can always put the stuff away at the apartment after your shopping trip before heading to the broadway shows or other locations! The apartment is really of great value to the money. Thank you Cleber and Gisela. I had a wonderful first time trip to New York. Will definitely stay at your place again. Thank you again for the lovely and cozy apartment!
Thanks, Ada.[QWERTY123]Thank you Cleber and Gisela. I had a wonderful first time trip to New York and lovely and cozy apartment! Thanks Oksana.[QWERTY123]Very nice accommodation. Superb location. Best quality for price.
I would recommend this accommodation especially to those musical lovers as theaters are really close (like 10 min walking). And it is amazing to wake up very early and walk to Central Park (around 20 min walking) and see the sunrise! :)[QWERTY123]It was fantastic to visit NY the first time in such a good location. The apartment is just what I needed, clean, comfortable, close to everywhere... I felt like I was living there in Manhattan. Gisela and Cleber were very helpful and kind from the beginning. I met Cleber the first day and he made me feel like if the apartment was my own home, and treat me like I was his friend. We share a couple of moments more and always he was very helpful, offering you a coffee, or an umbrella if it was raining...thanks for everything, I arrived at home without problems! I would recommend this choice not only because the place is perfect but also because the owner and his friend are good persons as well. Thaks for everything! I have enjoyed it a lot! See you![QWERTY123]Cleber and Gisela (friend who checked me in) were hospitable and made me feel right at home! The location can't be beat, just outside of all the action without being noisy from the street (there was construction going on across the street but I was pleasantly surprised at how quiet the room was). I didn't take the subway at all as I walked everywhere. YEs, the toilet is down the hall, but since i'm only crashing there and go once before bed and once in the morning, this wasn't an issue for me. Shower is in the suite, so that's perfect. Gisela checked in with me part way through to make sure everything was alright - great host! If I'm back in NYC again I will check the availability of this place first![QWERTY123]Great location - easy to access.  Some people might be bothered by the narrow shower / bathroom in the hallway, but wasn't a problem for me.  I was just happy with the fast wireless internet connection.  Would definitely stay again.[QWERTY123]Nice location, a little small (it is afterall NYC!) but it totally works!  Thanks for the fair price and everything really.[QWERTY123]Cleber I did not get to meet but Gisela who welcomed me to his home and cleaned and let me in early with my bags :p told me a bit about Cleber and she was just amazing! Great spirit! Very warm and inviting And freaking hilarious might I add! And Cleber too I can tell just through messaging back and forth  that these ate fear people :) 

I was so exhausted . My first day when I got in . I slept soooo well . In there . And surprisingly the apt has huge windows with lots of sunlight considering its location  that's pretty amazing! 

I felt like it was my apt for the weekend it was nice . And super easy to coordinate . I will definitely be staying here again! :) thx GISELA![QWERTY123]Gisela have hosted me since Cleber was out of town and she is very friendly and approachable. I did stupid things like locking myself out of the room and she came back and help me open the door without any complains! She also introduced me to what is around NYC and the must dos! Very sweet lady. The flat location is perfect. It is near times square, macy's, port authority bus terminal and all the touristy locations around times square. The only thing is the shower room and toilet was quite small for a fat guy like me! But it was manageable. Would definitely stay there again if I ever go NYC again. Thank You.[QWERTY123]Cleber was away at the time so his friend Gisela met me with the keys.  She was great, she had all sorts of tips and suggestions for places to go and how to get there.  The apartment was spotless and having the toilet out in the hall wasn't a big deal, especially since it's only for use by Clebers apartment.  It's kinda small, but I just needed a place to sleep and shower so I didn't care.  Might not be the best if you've got a lot of luggage or other equipment.  Location is amazing and Fast Sal's Pizza right next door had the best slice I found all week.  There's also a convenient Starbucks and 7 Eleven within a 2 minute walk.  If you're there on the weekend, the Hells Kitchen Flea Market is right across the street; tons of weird and wonderful antiques and oddities.  Can't recommend this place enough, I'll definitely be staying there again on my next trip![QWERTY123]* For the price the accommodation was extremely good value and clean.
* It has plenty of cheap and expensive restaurants nearby unlike closer to Central Park. 
* The main shopping street 42nd Ave, Times Square and the bottom end of Broadway is a stone throw away. 
* There is also a bus station a few streets north. 
* I used the shuttle bus to come to and from the airport JFK which dropped me and collected me from Element Hotel around the corner in 39th Street. 
* The host Cleber was a genial guy and fastidious about cleaning the flat clean. It is not the Ritz ; it's New York.[QWERTY123]It was an amazing and wonderful stay, Cleber truly made me feel like part of the family, giving me advices on where to go and what to do! Very focused on the details and keeping the apartment nice and clean! He would light up some scented candles to create a lovely and welcoming environment! The location was also extremely central, close to all the tourist attractions and means of transport! Would definitely reccomend this place and Cleber to everyone! Thanks

[QWERTY123]Its close to Time Square, Chelsea, bus and train stations, with so many places to go to eat and party![QWERTY123]Staying with Cleber was easy, affordable and in a great location for my visit for social media week. Cleber was there to greet me and make me feel welcome  and take me through the key arrangements, and he was accommodating with my leaving luggage in his room on departure day when another guest arrived. The room came with a comfy bed, large wardrobe and even a tv.  The shower was nice and hot also, and for my use in and out during social media week, this was a perfect cosy place to drop stuff and dash out.  I flew in and out from Newark so it also proved a great location for a walk to the bus stop from his place. Thanks for having me Cleber.[QWERTY123]The apartment is so conveniently located. 9th avenue is very cool. It's clean and comfy, very quiet (rare in NYC) and Cleber is very friendly and easy going. Would recommend this to anyone on a budget in NYC! It is very small and the loo is outside in a room in the hallway but it isn't that much of a problem. Give this a go![QWERTY123]Nuestra experiencia con Cleber fue muy buena, el lugar esta muy bien ubicado, tiene un tamaño justo, es super limpio. Nos ayudo con las valijas, cumplió con todo y fue super simpático y atento con nosotras! Volveríamos a ir sin duda. Realmente recomendable.[QWERTY123]This is a great place and makes an extremely affordable stay in NYC.  The location is a few minutes walk to Times Sq, the subway and bus station making accessibility very very easy.  The apartment is small - but is accurately described in the advertisement. I was very comfortable and well looked after by Cleber, he is a fantastic AirBnb host, who wants to make your stay as pleasant as possible. He was available to help answer any questions and also happily allowed me to leave my luggage in the apartment on check out day as I had a late flight. The apartment was very clean and tidy and nicely decorated, linen was fresh and the heating and hot water works really well so it was nice and cozy inside. There is plenty of natural light, and it's on the first floor so no hauling upstairs! The toilet is just down the hall, as described in the advertisement, but it's private to the apartment not shared. If you are concerned about this you shouldn't be - it's not a problem at all.  I would highly recommend this place if you want to be near the action for a short stay in NYC and lazing about the home isn't on your list of things to do. A ++++.[QWERTY123]Cleber is a true gentleman!
He waited for me as I arrived quite late into the night after my flight was delayed and put off his own plans to do so. Very welcoming and accommodating. The second room while very small is all you need for a place to crash. This apartment is in the perfect spot, 3 or 4 blocks from Times Square and while originally fearful of NYC felt safe everywhere I walked. It was truly amazing to have your own keys to your own apartment in NYC. I will be back to stay again in the future!
[QWERTY123]I really enjoyed my 4-day stay with Cleber.  He is a very friendly and attentive host. and the room cost and quality can't be beat for the location (near Times Square, Penn Station, Port Authority etc.)  I'd definitely recommend staying here if you want a great New York experience and hopefully I'll be down again in the future for a repeat visit![QWERTY123]Cleber is a nice host. His apartment is located in a privileged place and it's true when he say it's safety, cozy and clean. I was very happy to stay there.[QWERTY123]Cleber was a great and accommodating host. Really friendly and easy to reach via text or airbnb.[QWERTY123]Lovely room absolutely fantastic location.[QWERTY123]Great location,small room but nice and clean.
Thanks a lot and hope to come back.[QWERTY123]It was my first airbnb-experience and it was great! I met Cleber at my arrival and he explained everything necessary to me - so I could feel at home immediately. It`s a very central location - just perfect![QWERTY123]Pros: Cleber is a nice and very friendly person, the place is clean and the location is awesome.

Cons: it seems like the building was a Old Inn converted to small apartments and some how this apartment did not get its own bath room and the old common closet in the hallway way became private bathroom for this apartment. Bathroom is extremely small and it is only a towelette and there is no sink to wash your hand. Shower is also very small and old.
This not a very comfortable place to stay.[QWERTY123]What the description is Safe, Clean easy walk to Times Square and Hells Kitchen areas. Cleber met me as arranged helpful and welcoming. Location, Location, Location. A great place to stay.
I would stay here again next visit.[QWERTY123]The location of the appt is wonderful !! You're truly at the heart of everything, and the neighborhood is safe and convenient.
Cleber is an amazing host, very kind and helpful !!
The room was clean, bright and quiet. 
I'll definitely come back someday !![QWERTY123]Cleber is a very friendly and thoughtful host who was there tp meet me and show me the ropes. The room is perfect for anyone just wanting somewhere to lay their head although there are adequate cooking facilities should they be required. Altogether this suited my needs and as an added bonus is just a stone's throw from the subway ( 42nd & 8th ) and also the Port Authority bus terminal.Thoroughly recommended.[QWERTY123]Cleber is a great person. Very attentive and friendly. I recommend 100%. The apartment is really well located. In a possible new trip, I will certainly try to stay in the apartment again.[QWERTY123]What a great experience. Cleber was helpful and courteous, and easy to talk to. His place is clean and cozy, and the location was perfect for where I needed to be. I am so grateful for such a great experience -- this was my first AirBnB stay and it couldn't have gone better. Thank you so much![QWERTY123]Great location - super clean and so easy to get keys- Cleber is an excellent host and is well planned for your stay.  Hope to stay with Cleber again on my next visit to NYC! ![QWERTY123]This place is absolutely perfect for a stay in NYC. Location is perfect only minutes walking distance to ALL major Midtown Manhatten sights. It´s absolutely clean and comfortable. Area is totally safe to stay out until very very late :-) shopping dining and anything u can think off just around the corner.
Cleber is a great host...very friendly and helpful. gives u all the information u need and helps out if he can.

I had a hell of a great time there and i´ll sure be back at this place as soon as i can

[QWERTY123]location, location, location !!! The appartment is perfectly located, very close to Time square and train station, in the very hear tof Manhattan. Yet the neighbourhood is quiet and safe, with a flea market and nice bars close by. The room and bathroom were extra clean, which is def. what you need after a long journey ! Cleber is lovely and very helpful. the room is very small but is ok if you just need a bed where to crash at night.[QWERTY123]Great location; very central to everything you would want to see. Apartment is neat and Cleber was a good host even though I only saw him on the first day. Good experience in all. Would stay again.[QWERTY123]Cleber's place is clean, comfortable, and convenient to everything in Hells Kitchen and the theater district.  Two guest rooms and a shared kitchen--a lot more space than I've had in much more expensive hotels in the area.[QWERTY123]My stay here in Midtown Manhattan was wonderful.  Location, Location, Location.  Cleber, my host was prompt, friendly, warm and gracious. The apartment indeed was, safe, clean and cozy.  I can't wait to return.  I felt at home, the apartment was so quiet, I could not believe it!  It is no wonder the calendar is full, so reasonable and one of the best values on AirB&B.  This is about my 5th Air BB stay and I love using this great, helpful site,[QWERTY123]Clean and tidy appartment,  and great value, for central NYC. Cleber is a kind host, and helpful for your questions. I would not hesitate to visit again.[QWERTY123]First time Airbnb - Fantastic location! Almost everything I planned to see during my time in NYC was within walking distance or minutes by subway. The room (smaller one with full-size bed) was very clean and comfortable to stay in. Cleber was a gracious host and provided excellent communication throughout my stay. Highly recommended![QWERTY123]Cleber is an excellent host.  He was very responsive via text messages, which helped us arrange a precise, convenient time to meet at his apartment, without either one of us having to wait around for the other person.  My stay was for 3 nights.  I stayed in the smaller, non-loft room.  Yes, the room was small, but just the right size for me, even with my large suitcase.  The air-con worked very well to counteract the stifling 100-degree heatwave.  The Hell's Kitchen neighborhood was very convenient, with a wide range of restaurants and amenities.  All my favorite NY bars (Boxer's, Barrage, Flaming Saddle, Industry, Therapy) were all within 10 short blocks north.  The Port Authority bus station is just 2 blocks north, perfect for easy access to Newark Airport.  Much more convenient than Penn Station, which is 8 blocks south and 2 blocks east.  The only downside I can think of is the fact that the toilet is located down the hall (outside of Cleber's unit).  Be sure to carry the apartment key with you, or you'll be locked out!  Also, I'm tall (6'2""), so the shower/sink room (which is located within Cleber's unit) was a bit cramped.  But I don't mind sacrificing some conveniences to save 50% off what I thought I'd have to pay for accommodations in Manhattan.  Other points worth noting: Cleber's unit was tidy and reasonably clean.  No complaints there.
[QWERTY123]Stayed in the smaller room (the non-lofted one) for about a week.  It was a small space but it was just what I needed.  The apartment was quiet--a hard find in the city--and clean.  The bathroom situation, with the toilet in a separate room in the hallway, was a little strange at first but not a big deal at all.

Perfect place for a short stay![QWERTY123]Cleber es un gran anfitrion! todo esta limpio y ordenado, hay café y está equipado con todo lo que puedes necesitar para una corta estadia en NY. El departamento tiene una ubicacion comodisima, me encanto el barrio! 
[QWERTY123]This was my first booking with Airbnb and I'm glad that it turned out so well.  Cleber is a great host and is very easy to get along with.  The place itself is very clean and while a bit on the small side, you'd be hard pressed to find a more convenient location in NYC.  Times Square is just a few minutes away and you can easily get to Port Authority or Penn Station to get to the rest of the city.  If you need a bite to eat, there are TONS of options in that section of 9th Avenue so you'll never go hungry.  Lastly, the location is surprisingly quiet at night and the room is equipped with A/C to take the edge off on a hot night.  Overall I highly recommend staying here if you're looking to spend a few days in NYC.[QWERTY123]Great experience, my first booking international and I must say that I everything went smoothly, Cleber is really kind, always answered all my questions, the apartment the location is unbeatable, just around the corner of Port Authority bus terminal, and the apartment is great really clean, comfortable, exactly what I needed for my days there, good restaurants around, very well communicated and very safe at every hour, I'll definitely stay here again next time. Thanks Cleber for everything!.[QWERTY123]Cleber was a wonderful host! Great location in a very nice neighborhood of NYC, walking distance to everything yet you don't get overrun by tourists. Lots and lots of great restaurants in the area so no need to go far to find something awesome to try. Will definitely stay again in the future![QWERTY123]The reservation was canceled 32 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.[QWERTY123]I had a great stay at Cleber's apartment.
The apartment is spotless and everything you need for your stay is provided (clean sheets, towels, internet, TV, hot water, full kitchen, air conditioning, etc)
Ideally located in a quiet building, steps away from Time Square, Subway and convenience stores just beside the building.
Cleber is a great host, very flexible with check-in/check-out times and wait for the guest in person to hand the keys and show around the apartment.
Thank you Cleber, I enjoyed my stay in your apartment and I'd definitely recommend staying here.[QWERTY123]clean appartment + reliable and great host + central location = a great first air bnb expirence

I stayed at Cleber's appartment for three days to explore New York. The appartment is really easy to get to from the airport with the express bus (flew into La Guradia). 
Cleber is a great and welcoming guy. To me he embodies a piece of NYC's lifestyle and that's the extra benefit when using airbnb which I really like compared to rather numb hotel enviorment.
The apprtment is not the Ritz Carlton but suited the purpose to explore the city and have a nice little, quite sanctuary at night perfectly.[QWERTY123]Cleber was an excellent host.
He has very simple and comfortable apartment , an excellent location to explore all that New York has to offer.  Cleber's warmth and friendliness made my visit enjoyable.[QWERTY123]Regresar a casa de Cleber ya es volver a encontrar a un amigo muy querido. Como siempre su hospitalidad y calidez hizo que la barrera entre host y guest desapareciera. Por supuesto que la proxima vez que regrese a NY su apartamento serà la primera opcion. Hasta la proxima my friend. vou a ter suadades de voce. Ate pronto.[QWERTY123]What a nice stay at Cleber's place. I found not only a nice place to stay and chill out but a genuine nice guy to talk, to have a breakfast and to feel home. Amazing location, quiet, close to everything. Couldn't be better, just great! Thank you very much Cleber![QWERTY123]Cleber's place is perfect for sightseeing. The room is nice and the bed is big and comfortable. The external bathroom is not a problem at all. Cleber is a really great host, attentive and caring. Great experience in New York![QWERTY123]The neighborhood and place has character and charm.  The location is convenient.   It's small and the toilet is located in an interesting place but that is part of old Hell's Kitchen history.  Cleber is a great host.  He is eco-friendly and socially conscious that I learned a lot from him.  Would love to return back again.[QWERTY123]Great spot, close to Times Square and very quiet. Cleber is the perfect host and I would definitely stay here again whenever I'm back in nyc.[QWERTY123]This is a great location to stay for convenience in getting around. So much is in walking distance. The apartment is super clean and comfortable. The room isn't big, but it's not tiny. It's all you need, with a decent wardrobe too, and natural light. The city guide next to the bed is a nice touch.
Cleber is a friendly and thoughtful host, with advice if you need it. He's easy going but professional. I can highly recommend this BnB if you want a comfortable, convenient and clean place to base yourself while you explore NY.[QWERTY123]Amazing location. Steps from Port Authority and tons of restaurants on 9th. Room is small but cozy and comfortable. Especially helpful was the use of the wardrobe and the window sill! Very clean as well. Felt like I was living in NYC. Bathroom was small, but super clean. And the drain works. Nothing worse than a slow draining tub! Toilet in the hallway was fine. It's NYC - go with the flow! Also area is pretty quiet considering. For my first Airbnb experience, I am very happy! Plus as a solo female traveler felt very safe.[QWERTY123]Perfect location. A pub 10 meters from the entrance. 5-7 minutes walk to Times Square. Restaurants all around the area. If you're arriving from either JFK or Newark take the bus to Port Authority and it's a 5 min short walk from there. Felt very secure in the area and no outside noise in the room. Several subways close by.

Room is small, but I felt it was just what I needed. You don't go to NYC to stay in the room? Clean. Comfortable bed. I was a bit skeptical about the toilet in the hallway, but it worked great and I had no issues. 

Good communication with Cleber regarding arrival. Let him recommend you restaurants since he is a local. He recommended a very nice sushi restaurant to me. He is also a nice person to chat with. In total a very, very good experience and this place is highly recommended.[QWERTY123]Clever,  the best host you can get. He is very nice, and open. the place is clean, safe, and cozy. True! Near to everything. Next time in NYC definitely I will stay at cleber's. Thank you my friend.[QWERTY123]Cleber was an excellent host and his apartment is a great place to stay!  His apartment is very comfortable and clean and it was nice to have private room.  It was very close to the Port Authority and Times Square.  I felt like a real resident of New York City which is why I wanted to stay in an actual apartment in the City.  Having to walk up only one floor level was nice but not typical.  I think most people have to walk up many floors!  I cannot wait to return to New York City and stay with Cleber if his extra room is available!  Don't forget to check out the 39th Street Flea Market on Saturdays and Sundays which is very close.  It has some very interesting items!  I love New York![QWERTY123]Had a great stay with Cleber earlier this month! Fantastic location and one of the most comfortable bed's I've ever slept in.

Cleber was very accommodating and a great host![QWERTY123]Cleber is a wonderful host.  Very welcoming and lively.  The accommodation is clean and tidy and perfect for what I needed.  I definitely plan on staying with Cleber in the future.[QWERTY123]Cleber is a very polite and welcoming boy. The room is cozy and the foam-memory bed super confortable. Two blocks from port authority bus station, but really close to times square, bryant park, chelsea, hell's kitchen an so many other places. Very good price. Thank u![QWERTY123]hi... the stay in this appatment togeather with a very nice and helpful host ... thx to cleber everything was very easy (stay/ check in/ keys/ check out ;))  the bed holds what you have promised ;) everithing was clean and i will returne.  everything i needed .. timesquare MSG.. SUB... Bus and train was reached very easily by foot :)  nice lokation with warm atmosphere[QWERTY123]Cleber was totally cool….only saw him once but everything was perfectly clear. His place was ultra clean and functional.
Center of everything. Efficient and cost effective.[QWERTY123]Clean, convenient and cheap!  Great host[QWERTY123]Cleber was a great host. The location was perfect and the price was just right for me. The apartment is cozy, but that's part of the NYC experience. ;) All the info and pictures in this listing are spot on. If my journeys in NYC lead me to needing to be in this part of town again I'll definitely be checking to see if this listing is available![QWERTY123]Most  reliable and welcoming host. Very convenient neighbourhood.[QWERTY123]This was my first airbnb experience, and I was incredibly fortunate to have a gracious and flexible host. My flight was delayed 4 hours, and Cleber left in the middle of a friends birthday party to meet me and provide keys,

The location was clean, well kept, and the mattress was enviously comfortable. Now I have to get a 4 inch memory foam topper for my bed.

Cleber is also a hella interesting person, IF you're lucky enough to hang out with him.[QWERTY123]Cleber's apartment was very nicely located and was great to stay at for part of my time in New York.  It's definitely small and a bit cramped, but that's to be expected in NYC.  The toilet's in the hallway, which is annoying, but overall the place is a great location.[QWERTY123]It was my first time in NYC and I'll come back! Cleber's Apartment has a perfect location to discover Manhattan. It's close to Time Square, Broadway, Port Authority, Penn Station,... Unfortunately I didn't meet Cleber in person, but his friend welcomed me and handed over the keys. The Apartment is very clean, everything is available (Fridge, Glasses, Coffee machine, ...) Even if the room is not big, it was fully sufficient. The bed was very comfortable, is was quiet, a lot of light came through the window, perfect. Everything was as described by Cleber. I can only recommend this room.[QWERTY123]Tres bon séjour, appartement parfaitement située, à 10 mn à pied de Time Square ou convergent tous les métros. L'appartement est agréable, avec la cuisine à disposition. Je recommande pour quelqu'un voyageant seul.[QWERTY123]The Apartment was clean and tidy. Everything was as cited by the host Cleber. The bathroom is small, but functional. 

It has an ideal location in midtown Manhattan close to the port authority bus station, 10 minute walk to time square/ Broadway and near subway train lines; this makes it great to explore New York. 

Cleber is a pleasant chap and nice to talk to, and check in and out was easy as pie. 
[QWERTY123]I had a great time in New York and would really like to come again and stay at Cleber's place: he is very friendly, open-minded and I enjoyed meeting a host speaking my mother language! The room is exactly what is described and the location is more than perfect: I was walking to all points of interest and even the Penn Station, where I took my train to Providence, is just in 15' walking distance. There is a italien coffee shop at the corner, which a visited everyday for my daily ""double espresso"" ![QWERTY123]I had a great time. The location was excellent, the room had everything I needed, and Cleber was super friendly and accommodating. The toilet was down the hall, as others have mentioned, but that wasn't really a big deal to me.[QWERTY123]Cleber was an ideal host, and the location was great.  Highly recommended.[QWERTY123]This was my first timein NYC and my first airbnb experience as well.And I had a really good time over there! I was lucky enough to meet my hostCleber at my arrival as well as at my departure. He is a great host, caring, attentive, helpful,very interested in a lot of things of everyday life and of his (Website hidden by Airbnb) we had lively chats, and I enjoyed some cups of good coffee with him.The apartment comes up to the expectations: quiet, bright,, completely satisfying as you will only use it for sleeping. Its best value is its excellent location near NY's vivid centre and only some minutes on foot to the PABT. And that is what counts and what you pay for! By the way, Cleber is about to improve its look as he cares a lot about his guests' feeling good and well.
So, many thanks to him.[QWERTY123]Cleber was a vey nice and kind host. He was very helpful and welcoming in all times. His room is what u need if u are a solo traveler, close to the touristic places and very comfortable bed. One thing would make it better if the bathroom was inside the house but it was not an issue for me.[QWERTY123]Cleber was a great host and he made everything so easy to me,it's definitely the best location in time square and Hell's Kitchen,only 3-5 mins walk to the port authority terminal,that's much easier for people to take the airtrain or bus to the EWR airport when u have big luggages,and for some reasons,cleber'a friend was not there when I checked in,he cycled 20 mins from queens in order to give me the key,so appereciate that![QWERTY123]I had such a great stay at Cleber appartement! 
It was my1st airbnb experience and it was a massive success! 
Cleber's appartement is very well located, from there you can do everything walking. 
The apartment is super clean and Cleber is a very nice person, easy to get on with. 
I felt very comfortable staying with him for almost a week. 
I recommend to stay with Cleber to anyone![QWERTY123]I enjoyed staying at Cleber's place. His place is clean, quite, and walking distance to many attractions and Broadway shows. Reserve Broadway shows in advance. Buy your MetroCard as soon as you get there and enjoy the whole Manhattan quickly. Cleber's place is just 5 minutes walking from Time Square subway stop.[QWERTY123]The apartment is tiny, tidy and clean. The location is excellent. Cleber is reliable and attentive host. I was touched to find the euro plug power adopter next to the socket in my room:) Thank you!
[QWERTY123]Had such a great time . Cleber kept to himself and was perfect . Meet me with open arms and filled me in on what's near by etc . I was only in town for 4 nights seeing broadway shows and never had a hassle with Cleber was a perfect host ! Highly recommend[QWERTY123]I had a lovely time staying at Cleber's place. Clean and comfy. Very easy to reach by any public transport (close to train, subway, bus...). Walking distance from times square and Broadway. Cleber was  there to receive me and was easily reachable and responsive during my stay.[QWERTY123]It was great! Cleber was really nice und flexible. The appartment was exactly as described. Nice, clean and centrally located in the heart of Manhattan and really close to Time Square. I would book it again![QWERTY123]What a great weekend at Cleber's place. If you want to be right in the heart of New York this place is perfect. Cleber was really nice when we met and I felt incredibly safe the whole time. With a key to the entrance, to the place and my room I couldn't have asked for anymore of a surety that my belongings were secure whilst I roamed the Big Apple. I would highly recommend this place to any single or couple heading to NY for a short or long stay. The shower was certainly small but it worked perfectly was a great end to the day after lots and lots of walking. The toilet situation down the hallway was not worry at all and was very easy to use. Thanks Cleber and hopefully I will see you again in the future![QWERTY123]A lovely apartment with a good sized room and bed in an excellent location. I was made to feel very welcome and will be recommending this place to my friends![QWERTY123]Cleber was an excellent host and his apartment is a great place to stay!   The location is excellent. Very welcoming and lively. The accommodation is clean and tidy and perfect for what I needed. Would love to return back again.[QWERTY123]Cleber is a very great host. He answered all my questions and gave some recommendations for things i should do. The flat was very clean and i got my own room with a/c and tv. He made my New York Trip an awesome experience![QWERTY123]I was very well received by Cleber, the room is small but adequate and it is close to metro stations and Times Square. There is little noise at night time, and I could sleep very well there. Thanks Cleber![QWERTY123]Room is clean, well maintained; it is simple to live there. 
Keys work well and in-and-out are easy.
Quite some food choices within two blocks[QWERTY123]I didn't have the pleasure to meet Cleber during my stay but everything was ready for me on arrive land I felt very much welcome. The room itself itself is small but this is Hell's Kitchen so it was expected. Only downside is the toilets situated in the hall but they were very clean so nothing to complain about here.[QWERTY123]Great experience. Very close to Time Square. Clean bedroom and toilet.
Muito boa experiencia. Pertinho da Time Square. Quarto e banheiros limpos.
[QWERTY123]This is my first Airbnb experience, my first trip to NYC, and first time to travel alone and Cleber's hospitality helped make things easier. Booking was very easy and straightforward, and Cleber is willing to answer queries. 

Room was exactly advertised and perfect for traveling alone. Bed is comfy and aircon makes room cozy. Shower area is small but not a problem at all and so is the toilet in the corridor. No complaints whatsoever especially if you read Cleber's description of room prior to booking. 

What's best with Cleber is he cares for his customers. After not arriving in the apartment 3 hours after I landed, Cleber had the courtesy to call and check how I am doing. 

Same thing with my last day where I was out roaming the city and did not check out at 12nn. Cleber called up just to make sure I am safe. Though my sincerest apologies for the miscommunication!

If you are traveling alone, book this room. Nice host, nice room with wifi, and near subway, bus station, and Times Square. You definitely will get more than you paid for.[QWERTY123]Cleber was very welcoming! Location was very good for the conference I was attending towards Central Park.[QWERTY123]Cleber m'attendait dans l'appartement dès mon arrivée. Il m'a tout expliqué en ce qui concerne les règles de vie dans l'immeuble, les clés pour la chambre, les toilettes, la porte d'entrée. 
Tout s'est très bien passé, un hôte très cordial et amical. 
Cet appartement est également vraiment à 2 pas de Times Square. 
Aucun problème pour trouver l'appartement (description donnée par Cleber très simple).[QWERTY123]Buenísima estadía! Fue mi primera visita a NYC y también fue la primera vez que utilicé el servicio de Airbnb, y la verdad no podría estar más satisfecha, tanto con el servicio como con el departamento.  Es chiquito pero es más que suficiente para el tiempo que se está en él, siempre limpio tanto el baño (el cual estaba siempre perfumado) como el departamento en su totalidad, ubicación perfecta cerca de Times Square y de la gran mayoría de líneas de subte (a dos cuadras hay una estación de varias líneas y también combina con todas las que pasan por Times Square), equipado con todo lo que se pueda llegar a necesitar durante la estadía, perfectamente seguro ya que la puerta de la habitación tiene llave, barrio tranquilo y silencioso por las noches. No tuve la oportunidad de conocer a Cleber ya que no estaba en la ciudad cuando llegué, pero muy amablemente unos días antes de viajar me lo informó y me pasó el mail de su amiga Regina quien me atendió de manera excelente y con quien podía contactarme enseguida por cualquier consulta. En resumen, 100% satisfecha y feliz de haber elegido este departamento y esa ciudad para mis vacaciones. Lo recomiendo sin ninguna duda. Muchas gracias Cleber por toda tu muy amable atención, sin dudas volveremos a estar en contacto.[QWERTY123]In New York you get what you pay for. This is a very budget apt with a budget feel. The bed is extremely comfortable, the kitchen looks like it has everything you need. The shower is fine but the toilet is in the corridor, shared, tiny and whilst I was there - broken. Its quite central, a 5min walk to the subway and 10-15mins walk to the centre of Times Square. I didn't meet Cleber when I stayed, and the communication with his friend was confusing and inconsistent. She didn't meet me to let me in the first time, instead it was another chap staying in the apartment. I do think she should have made the effort to greet me. Overall my stay was good, but not excellent. I am also concerned that the sheets don't get washed between people staying.[QWERTY123]It was very nice to stay at Cleber. The room is like you see, clean and safe. The neighbour is perfect for location in the center of the city, well connected in and out from any airports. I really recommend it. Fast answers and really nice people. I met Regina, Cleber's friend, really nice woman and, very friendly and helpful! Thank you!![QWERTY123]Cleber est un hôte très agréable et sympathique qui vous met a l'aise et fais tout pour que vous passiez un bon séjour. L'appartement est vraiment super bien situé et bien équipé. C'était un plaisir.[QWERTY123]Cleber is a very welcoming host who knows the area very well and can recommend places to see. I would absolutely recommend and if I return I'll definitely look to stay here again[QWERTY123]A great place to stay in Manhattan, close to many sights and nice restaurants. The room was kept clean and communicating with the host was very easy! Would definitely consider staying here in the future.[QWERTY123]Bien situado, cerca del intercambiador de Times Square para tener acceso rapido a diferentes lineas de metro. El apartamento estaba limpio, la habitación sencilla pero adecuada si lo que buscas es un lugar donde descansar. La cama es bastante cómoda. La ducha dentro del apartamento y el inodoro en el pasillo pero privado, limpio y de facil acceso. 

Cleber es muy cordial y dispuesto a ayudar en lo que sea necesario.

Satisfecho con la estancia!![QWERTY123]I arrived a bit earlier than announced, but the host responded to my mobile phone and appeared right away to let me in. The Place is clean, the bedroom is small, but enough space in the bedroom, unless you travel with a lot of suitcases, I had only one. The shower room is small, but there is plenty of hot water. One drawback is that the toilet is located in a corridor outside the apartment. You have to walk up one floor on a narrow staircase, staircases don't bother me (I am used to three floors up), but if you have trouble walking them, this may not be the place. The neigboorhood is close to Times Square, it has a lot of small restaurants, one of them (on the same block) is a nice Italian coffeeshop. It is also close to Port Authority Bus Terminal and Penn Station is within walking distance. The room is quiet during the night since it faces a backyard, even in the morning you can hardly hear any traffic from 9th Ave. The bed is comfortable.[QWERTY123]If your sole purpose to visit NYC is for Broadway then this apartment is great. It's a ten minute walk to TKTS booth and 5 mins to the theatre district. Facilities aren't the best but the location is what you want. Great restaurants nearby and close to a subway station. Cleber was an excellent host with great knowledge of the city and shortcuts to get out of the winter cold. I would definitely stay here again.[QWERTY123]Staying at Clebers place was very nice. The room is clean and ok. Cleber is a very friendly host. The neighbourhood is nice, a lot of restaurants and shops. Easy to reach by metro. Good place to stay!
[QWERTY123]Cleber is a friendly, helpful, unassuming host. The room itself is comfortable, if small. The bed is very comfortable indeed and I slept quite well. The room was also nice and warm in a very cold Manhattan December. In the morning pigeons coo softly outside the window creating an almost rustic atmosphere.
But the space is quite small and can feel cramped. And the toilet down the hall can be a bit daunting, especially on late night visits.
The space is exactly as described. If you are clear on what you want and aware of the drawbacks, it as, as advertised, a clean, comfortable, and affordable space in a convenient location.[QWERTY123]Cleber is a really nice host. He shows you the apartment when you arrive and tells you everything you need to know. The room is very nice and confortable. The location is absolutely perfect for whoever want to visit the city. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone who wants to go to NYC![QWERTY123]Came in on a day with airport delays and inclement weather, Cleber patiently waited for me, despite those delays.   Place was in a great location.  Two bedrooms with a shared kitchen, shower and sink off from the kitchen, toilet was down the hall but in no way inconvenient.    I came in the winter, heat was wonderful, never felt cold in any way.   Cleber kept the place very tidy and clean.   Especially liked the fast wireless internet and netflix on the TV.   You can tell Cleber goes out of his way to make sure you're happy with things.    The neighborhood has restuarants and bars nearby, meaning people frequently come to you rather than you having to come to them (Don't tell Mama is six blocks away, Rudy's is three).    Times square is near enough to go for a fun stroll.    Transporation at Penn Station is nearby, the PABT is even nearer.    What's nice about the PABT being so near is that there are many underground passeges in the subway that mean less walking out in inclement weather.    All in all, great experience, great neighborhood, great to work with host.   Highly Recommend.[QWERTY123]Good clean place. Great host. 
I stayed four days and had meetings during the day, it was easy to get in and get out.[QWERTY123]O lugar é muito limpo, bacana e confortável, o Cleber é muito prestativo e atencioso.
Recomendo o Lugar é 10! A localização é ótima pertinho da time square , a vizinhança é maravilhosa.
[QWERTY123]The best experience ever!! Luiz was so nice and helpful! This is honestly the best place and best choice I made. I wish it was available longer but due to the amazing location and hospitality it's always booked. It was like having my own apt while in NY. I really loved it and I will definitely go back very soon! This will be my go to place from now on when I go to NY if it's available. You will love it!!!![QWERTY123]Great location, comfortable room, communicative host. I had a great experience![QWERTY123]The apartment is great, clean, and really well located. Bed is comfy. You have a fridge, coffee machine and good wifi. Thank you Luiz.[QWERTY123]Très bien situé à côté du métro. Accueil parfait. Appartement très petit ![QWERTY123]Хозяин порядочный, месторасположение шикарное, комната не для привередливых, на несколько дней вполне подойдет![QWERTY123]Staying with Luiz was great, very helpful and friendly guy.

About the aptmt:
+ Cheap
+ Cozy
+ Great location in vivid area
- Small room
- Toilet outside the apmt, meaning you have to cross the hallway to use it.

I was there for one week so the room started feeling a bit too small. However, there is a second room available in the same aptmt which would provide more space.

I would definitely go there again![QWERTY123]Luiz met me on arrival and was very helpful.
The apartment is very small, but it has everything you need for a base in the centre of Manhattan.[QWERTY123]Cleber is very nice and warm, I enjoyed this visit to NY.[QWERTY123]t was a very good experience. Luiz is an effortless and understanding host. The location is great, the apartment nice and clean. Offer definitely recommendable.[QWERTY123]Very clean apartment[QWERTY123]La experiencia con Luiz a sido maravillosa, nunca antes había usado Airbnb y estoy completamente satisfecho con el servicio. 
El apartamento era exactamente igual que en la descripción y Luiz fue muy amable des del primer momento. 
Si vuelvo a NYC repetiré seguro en este apartamento, el qual esta muy bien situado (a unos 10 min andando de times square).
¡Gracias Luiz![QWERTY123]It was a great room everything I expected. Felt very comfortable, very close to everything I wanted to do. Luiz is a very nice guy very helpful. I appreciate the whole experience.[QWERTY123]The place was great—very CLEAN, conveniently close to lots of places, and easy access to the subway. Yea its small, but by no means is it uncomfortable. You definitely get everything you need from a place for your trip. To top it off, Luiz is a really nice guy and very responsive if you have any questions.[QWERTY123]Luis was very sportive, answered all mails I sent to him when I forgot my shampoo in his apartment. Location was nice, the only thing that I didn't like that to go to toilet with keys, as it is outside of the apartment .[QWERTY123]Midtown NY, not too big but good for stay...also very quiet and comfortable,
Thank you![QWERTY123]Me gusto mucho.  Fue la primera vez que reserve por Airbnb. Y tenia miedos. El depto es clean comodo. Y bien ubicado. LUIZ fue muy amame me explico todo. Era por ahi medio incomodo lo del bañito en el pasillo. Pero nada que me alterara la estadia. La cocina esta bien equipada . Para el que cocina. No es mi caso. Igual. Hay heladera microondas. Y todo lo que necesites.[QWERTY123]luiz was super-nice, easy communication--room clean and as described (you can even lock it by key)!!! very central--which makes the neighbourhood a little time-square-stressed but you can easely reach all other NY-hoods by metro or YOU COULD RENT a citi bike and cruise NY!!! overall it was the perfect stay for my tiny time-slot--would come back anytime! GOOD STAY FOR A GOOD PRICE, best, lisa
[QWERTY123]The booking process was without problems. The host's representative was very friendly, and explained everything in detail upon arrival. The apartment was as described ""cozy and clean"" in every aspect. I liked the kitchen a lot, and the small little details in the apartment that made it homey.  The location is conveniently near to many subway stations and many highlights of the city. The proximity to the port authority bus terminal made it a bit noisy, and some homeless people around the area made it a bit ""scary"" to return home late hours. The restroom is located in a corridor adjacent to but outside of the apartment, but it is locked for private use of yourself and your roommate, and is clean.[QWERTY123]Luiz was wonderful! Couldn't askfor a better host. The list was as advertised and the location was perfect. Will definitely stay here again.[QWERTY123]La descripción de Luiz de su apartamento es bastante precisa: Seguro, Limpio y Acogedor. Esta habitación está en un lugar privilegiado, cerca de todos los lugares no sólo para el turista, sino también para el que quiere volver muchas veces a la city. Rodeado de restaurantes y de pequeños comercios, con muy buen ambiente, y cerca de distintos tipos de transporte. 

La habitación está muy limpia, es cómoda y agradable y es silenciosa, teniendo en cuenta el lugar tan céntrico en el que está. Y para descansar, tiene una televisión online, con todos los canales y servicios de internet para ponerse al día. El resto del apartamento, aunque pequeño, es más que suficiente, agradable e impoluto.

Desde ahora es mi primer lugar en la lista para New York.[QWERTY123]Space was small, but in a good location. The other bedroom in the apartment was also being rented out, but the other tenant was quiet and respectful. Toilet is shared among the four apartments on the floor, which was never an issue but is good to note.

Luiz was attentive and on time for first arrival. He was responsive to Airbnb messages and very helpful.

Overall the apartment isn't much but if you're in New York you probably won't be in it very much. For the price and location, it's tough to beat.[QWERTY123]Luiz is a great host. This is a great place to stay in a great location close to public transportation or walking distance to central park and times square. It's clean and cozy and Luiz is very personable and willing to answer questions about how to get around, etc.[QWERTY123]I had a perfect stay at Luiz place, close to everything!
Thank u for my first nyc experience[QWERTY123]Location, location, location! Can't beat the location of Luiz's place! Just a couple blocks away from Times Square, many subway stops, Port Authority, Penn Station. Could not be more convenient! 

The room is exactly as pictured, small but cozy. The bed is comfortable, and the apartment is very clean. The building is old, so it has some quirks, like the toilet in the hallway outside front door. But the toilet is clean and locked, not shared by anyone else, so I wasn't bothered at all. The building entrance is very secure, and I felt safe in the neighborhood.

Luiz was very friendly and flexible with my check in times. He waited for me to arrive from a much delayed flight. He took great care to show me the place and make sure I knew how to open and lock all doors, including the one to my room (I didn't feel that was necessary, but a nice option). 

The place was very quiet and peaceful, even though it is located on bustling 9th Ave. Luiz was very mindful of my space. This was a perfect situation for me, as I was gone all day and really just needed a comfortable place to sleep. 

CANNOT BEAT THE PRICE FOR TGE LOCATION. I will definitely stay with Luiz again if I need a place to crash in Manhattan.[QWERTY123]First of all, Luiz has been the perfect host. He was not too intrusive and also had the time to chat. Although I arrived late, Luiz made arrangements regarding the key to the apartment. Moreover, the apartment itself was ideal for me: not to large, with netflix, hulu and wifi plus the location is excellent for tourists. When the weather got hotter, the ac worked well. Although it was close to Times Square, I did not notice the hustle and bustle of the city until I exited the apartment building. In respect of the toilet outside the apartment- never really bothered me since it was only our apartment using it. The only thing is that one has to exit the apartment and enter into the next door, not an issue at all. All in all, Luiz's apartment is the best way to experience New York for a great price![QWERTY123]When I got to NY I was completely overwhelmed with how busy it was! The place was clean and cosy and most importantly close to everything which was what I needed for the things I wanted to see! 

Cleber makes very good recommendations yet respects your privacy! He is thoughtful as I could not sleep with the aircon on at night so he kept his door open so the airflow from his room would flow into mine. On my final day he also helped me with my luggage and walked it to the bus shuttle pickup to the airport.

The toilet is located outside of the apartment which was clean and was not a problem for me! Thankyou Cleber for your hospitality![QWERTY123]This was a gorgeous apartment in an extremely central, convenient area... minutes walk to the theatre district and very clean & welcoming with all you could need for a short stay. Luiz was lovely, friendly, generous and accommodating. The toilet being outside the apartment was not a problem as it is still private to this apartment and locked with a key... I have paid more to stay in a hostel in Manhattan with all bathroom facilities shared so I would definitely recommend this accommodation :)[QWERTY123]Luiz, the host was really nice to have checked me in past 11:00 PM because of delay in my flight into NYC. He was very responsive to my questions both before and during my stay. The host has his own home, so he was not staying in the apartment. There was another room in the apartment that was rented to another guest during my stay.

Pros: This place is very clean and nice. The big plus is that it is located within walking distance to some many places of interest: theaters, Pier 83 for the Circle Line cruise, Times Square, Empire State Building, the metro station on 42nd Street, Hell's Kitchen just across from the apartment, pizza place for midnight snack, ... the list goes on. The apartment has a kitchen, fridge, and microwave oven, but I didn't cook.

Cons: The toilet is outside the apartment, and has no sink to wash your hands. Bring wet wipes or hand sanitizer. The bathroom has no hooks or hangers for your bath towel and clothing. Take a hanger with clips from the bedroom to hang your towel and clip your clothing, and hang the hanger on the shower curtain bar when you take a shower. Despite the cons, I still give this place a 5 star rating because of the pros that outweigh the cons.

For the room rate, the location, the clean, neat and secured apartment, and free WIFI, I would stay there again. Also, this room can sleep 2 people in the queen size bed (for couples or friends who don't mind sharing a bed). Just check with the host.[QWERTY123]A nice place, clean, and close to many bus lines and subway![QWERTY123]Chambre très agréable, bien que légèrement bruyante (je vis plutôt à la campagne habituellement) mais difficile de copier cela à quelques minute de Times square je suppose[QWERTY123]Very great experience. Luiz and his friend Bruno made everything very easy to do and were very accommodating! It was a good spot, clean and super easy to walk to Times Square! The toilet is in the hall, and even then, it was fine for me![QWERTY123]The neighborhood and room were nice. There was an issue with the curtains when I arrived that Luiz did everything in his power to resolve the issue. Luiz was great. The apartment is close to times square and is  easy to get from and to public transportation. As others have noted, the toilet is down the hall outside the apartment but that is not a problem it works well and there is not a lot people traffic in the building.[QWERTY123]El departamento es muy lindo, la habitación es cómoda e igual a lo que se ve en las fotos.
Esta muy bien ubicado, cerca de varios puntos turísticos importantes a los cuales podes llegar a pie. 
Se encuentra a dos cuadras de Port Authority Bus Terminal y la estación de Metro que te trae del Aeropuerto JFK.
Luiz es una persona muy agradable, esta dispuesto a facilitar tu estadía en la ciudad.
Yo llege a la ciudad a las 9 am y el check in era a las 3 pm, previamente hable con Luiz contantandole esto, y el hizo todo lo posible para que pueda entrar antes al departamento. 
Va a ser la primer opción cuando vuelva a NY, por la ubicación y la comodidad.
Gracias Luiz.[QWERTY123]Very good location, easy to go to PABT subway station, or Times Square. Cozy and quiet for a good sleep. Luiz is very kind and always help with what I need. I will recommend it to everyone.[QWERTY123]Small room and apartment but suited my needs. I didn't go to NY to stay in my room. Description was spot on.[QWERTY123]I liked Luiz. He was nice. Didn't see him all that much because I was out exploring New York. He wasn't in the apartment for too long because another visitor arrived shortly after for the second room. 

The toilet is located outside the apartment in the hallway, but it wasn't much of an issue for me. The sink/bathroom was a tad small for brushing your teeth and drying off after the shower. The bed was comfy and big enough to stretch out your limbs. The location is perfect, though, right near Times Square! There's a restaurant near by called Capizzi that makes great pizza and the apartment is minutes away from a Crossfit gym that I ended up working out in. You're pretty much in the centre of NYC and all the major attractions are pretty easily accessible either by foot or subway. Had a blast! I walked everywhere. Didn't spend much time in the apartment because I was out the whole day, but for the price and location it is a good bargain.  :)

Plus, the apartment had coffee and tea available so that you can make your own cup in the morning if you choose. A little added bonus.[QWERTY123]Ótima localização e apartamento aconchegante. Perfeito![QWERTY123]I enjoyed staying at Luiz. Everything was as described and I had very good communication with Luiz. He would promptly answer to my messages regarding checkin and checkout. 
I don't know about the kitchen and cooking equipment because I didn't use them. I would have my coffee at Starbucks.  
This is a place for someone looking for clean and quiet place to sleep after hours of exploring Manhattan. Almost forgot - I got a clean bath towel when I checked in. Big plus![QWERTY123]La experiencia en general ha sido muy (Website hidden by Airbnb) habitación es algo pequeña pero con espacio suficiente para unos días y bastante tranquila para estar en una zona muy céntrica!!los baños también son estrechos pero la experiencia de salir de casa para ir al aseo al final no fue tan incomoda como esperaba!!y por supuesto la localización es perfecta para poder ir paseando a todos los sitios importantes de Manhattan!!recomendable!![QWERTY123]Best place ever ! Safe and clean
Luiz was very nice 
For sure I will come back[QWERTY123]Sinceramente Luiz es una persona muy amable. Siempre contesto los mensajes, y a la hora de encontrarnos ya me estaba esperando. La zona es cerca de la 5ta av. Esta cerca la estación de tren y de colectivos. La habitación es pequeña, pero excelente para quien quiere salir recorrer Nueva York. 100% recomendable!![QWERTY123]It was a great experience being at Luiz's place. Location was great, bus and train stations in close proximity, the room was clean and well maintained. Luiz is a friendly and wonderful host, he contacted me before my arrival and waited for me even though I arrived at midnight. I definitely recommend his place.[QWERTY123]I would highly recommend this safe private room if your are single and wanting to enjoy the sights of NYC on a budget. The room was a short walk to Times Square, shopping, restaurants, venues and easy access to all types of transportation. The host was able to give me a good experience of NYC! I'll definetly return.[QWERTY123]Luiz es una persona muy agradable, podes consultarlo sobre lo q necesitas en la ciudad y se mantiene en contacto por cualquier necesidad[QWERTY123]The host was of great hospitality. He was very kind and responded quickly. The room was very clean and had much of cute decors. (Imagine the bathroom full of seashells !) The location was great. It was very close to the port authority so easy to arrive, and also close to Times Square so easy to go out. There are a lot of restaurants you can easily visit even if you are alone. The bedroom was small so you do not have enough space to do a business job. For a leisure purpose, I recommend this room as a very starting point.[QWERTY123]The apartment is well located in the center of Manhattan.

[QWERTY123]I was anxious for my first experience and it was super great! The apartment is perfectly located a few blocks from times square, righr next to the bus terminal. I would hang out during the day and if i got tired just got back to the apartment to rest for a bit. The bed was super comfty and late at night I would watch amazon prime courtesy of the host.[QWERTY123]Great location and a great host. Room is small but the TV with Netflix for when you need to rest your legs and switch off is great. Plenty of food and entertainment nearby, safe and secure. Thanks![QWERTY123]The location is great, on a busy street with lots of places to eat and drink, so its very safe.  The room has netflix and amazon prime on the TV which was nice to watch when you're tired.[QWERTY123]Luiz is a great guy and a very thoughtful gracious host. The flat is very nicely located and with good access to the midtown. The flat is very simple and everything is easy access. All you need in one easy spot close to the times building etc. Also the pub next door is full of very friendly people. Definitely check it out if you have a free evening. Nice bunch![QWERTY123]Cleber is a very nice and friendly guy.
Flexible on check-in time because my flight arrival time in JFK was 7pm and 10pm at the apartment.
Flexible too on check-out time, he let me store baggage untilmy afternoon departure in the airport.
Room is very clean. not so big but enough to rest legs during the day or for good sleeping during the night, the bed is very comfortable.
The bathroom inside the apt (sink and shower) is very little but works perfectly, the toilet is on hallway and very clean.
Location is just amazing, very close to Time Square, 42th street, Bus/Train/Subway station. 
I have spent 4 days in NYC without any problems no problem on staying in Cleber's apartment. 
Many, many thanks Cleber ! 
See you next time in NYC at you apt[QWERTY123]Location,location,location. Feeling like I hit the jackpot with Luiz's place. I went to the salon downstairs and even the hair stylist who has been working in this area for five years told me this is the best deal she's ever heard. Few mins walk away from Time square, subway stations,port authority bus terminal and basically everything you will need. Comfy bed, clean room and safe building. The host is very helpful and responsive. Highly recommended to everyone.[QWERTY123]I rented the apartment from his friend because he was away.
The apartment is good and clean and it's close to the times square and everything that is in the midtown.
My only issue was that the key/locker to the apartment is a bit tricky so it takes some times to open up the door. And this gets too annoying if you've been out the whole day and you come home tired.
And the wi-fi didn't work the last day. It said there was wi-fi but the connection came and went the whole day.[QWERTY123]Luis was out of town, so his friend Marco met me, and Marco was great! The pictures are true to form, but they don't quite get across the feel of the place. It felt a bit more like a hostel that I expected, have ever experienced on AirBnb. But the place was CLEAN! It was quiet, and the location is amazing. I myself prefer a toilet in-suite, and a regular/full shower, but, at the price, I'll take it! I was mostly out at work or with friends in the evening, so, it was more like a sleeping place for me. If you're looking for good location, clean, and cheap, this is a great bet![QWERTY123]I didn't meet Luiz as he was away, but Marco (really lovely guy) came in to give me the keys, explain everything, and made me feel so welcome.[QWERTY123]This apartment is a 10-15 min walk away from Times Square in a neighborhood that is that is reasonably quiet and yet not frightening to walk around at night.
You definitely need to be agile to make proper use of it - it's on the 2nd floor of a building via a staircase (no elevator), bathroom (outside the apartment) is down the hall and up some stairs, shower room (within the apartment) is up a few stairs, and your bed is up the stairs (above a couch).  It's an old building with character and quite different from your usual hotel room.

Price is good, bed is comfortable. I haven't used the tv but internet/wifi is good. 

Hosts (Luiz and Marco) are responsive and will help make your stay better without getting in your way.
[QWERTY123]Really enjoyed my visit and staying here. It's a great location and very easy to get to many of the sights New York has to offer! The apartment is as described and I have no complaints.[QWERTY123]Great location with many restaurant options nearby. The space is easily accessible, warm, and inviting. A small room but all I did was sleep there and it was great for that![QWERTY123]My plane did not arrive until 10 pm and Luiz waited for me with the keys![QWERTY123]Luiz是个不错的房东,刚到纽约那天飞机下来后堵车,比约定时间晚到了,他还是在公寓等我,并帮我拿箱子｡房间小而温馨,非常安静这点我很喜欢｡公寓就在中城中心位置,离时代广场不远｡[QWERTY123]The place was very nice! Clean and great location. Very easy to get around NYC. The bus/subway/Times Square/Theater District  is only few minutes walk. Around the apartment have many choices of food. Also it's safe when you have to walk home at night. Luiz was very nice, he met me at my check in and explain everything I need to know. Thank you very much! If I have a chance to go back I will difinitely stay at his place again :)[QWERTY123]Luiz ist ein sehr sympathische Gastgeber und jederzeit telefonisch erreichbar. die Wohnung ist super gelegen. Ohne umzusteigen, kommt man fast direkt vor der Wohnung an. Der Time square lst um die Ecke, wie auch der Zugang zur Subway. Ich kann diese Unterkunft nur empfehlen. Zwar ist die Toilette draußen auf dem Flur, aber das stört nicht. 
Für die Lage und zu dem angebotenen Preis einfach unschlagbar. 
Erschlagen vom morgendlichen Spaziergang?! Kurz in die Wohnung und entspannen ohne viel Zeit zu verlieren, ist jederzeit möglich. Geschäfte sind fussläufig erreichbar.
Zwar ist das Zimmer sehr klein, aber wofür braucht man in New York ein großes Zimmer?[QWERTY123]Luiz was very friendly. He explained everything I need to know for the stay! The place was just few blocks away from Times Squares.. about 5-7 minutes walk. Also, the bed was very comfy. I would definitely reserve Luiz's place again for the next visit![QWERTY123]Luiz is nice and patience. The room is small, but it is very comfortable. It is a good location, and it walks about 8 minutes arriving subway. It is very convenient, and it suitable for people to travel.[QWERTY123]The listing was exactly as described and perfectly suited my needs. The location was FANTASTIC and was definitely the biggest plus of the apartment. The Times Square subway station was a short walk away and allowed me to easily travel all over Manhattan without having to transfer trains. Additionally, there are plenty of restaurants in the immediate vicinity of the apartment. The room itself is a bit small, but for only one person it was just fine. Besides, with everything to see and do in the area I never had a reason to dwell in the apartment for very long.[QWERTY123]Luiz was there to meet me when I arrived and showed me around the apartment. The apartment was small but neat.  The bathroom was very small but clean.  The toilet is outside the apartment in the hallway, but accessed only by a key.
The apartment was conveniently located and central to all attractions Times Square, Broadway and Madison Square Garden about a 7 minute walk.
Room was cosy and apartment warm (it was snowing outside).   Would recommend.[QWERTY123]Luiz was in Brazil so a friend of his was there to welcome me - checking in time was flexible 
The room looked small on the picture - it was even smaller than I imagined if you put a middle sized luggage on the floor you can't move anymore 
The shower works very bad randomly becoming really hot or really cold all of a sudden 
Toilet is in the aisle but they said nobody apart from this flat uses it 
Wifi didn't work some times - first time luiz wouldn't answer for one and a half days
Located very central I experienced it as an ok neighborhood it's in the middle of tourist zone 
My pillow, blanket and towel weren't fresh - they smelled.[QWERTY123]The apartment is so nice! I really recommend this place. Luiz is also nice and friendly. One time, the room keyhole did not work but he fixed it quickly. I really appreciate it. I felt safe during my stay. 
Thank you again! And will rent his place again when I come back to NY!

今回1人で滞在させて頂きました｡1人だったので不安でしたが､ｱﾊﾟｰﾄに着いた時､Luiz が温かく迎えてくれ不安は一気に吹き飛びました｡立地としては､地下鉄も4〜10分程歩けば行けますし､徒歩でﾀｲﾑｽﾞｽｸｪｱ等の観光地も行けます｡部屋は小さいですが､1人で滞在には十分の大きさです｡とても綺麗で滞在中不安に思ったことはありませんでした｡また是非ﾆｭｰﾖｰｸへ行った際はLuiz のとこで部屋を借りたいと思います｡
本当にありがとう!Luiz![QWERTY123]Luiz is a great guy, he was flexible on the arraving and departure times, I arrived at around 7PM and he was there to give me the keys and show me around the apartment. Leaving my luggage in the apartment until 2.30PM on the day of leaving also wasn't a problem.  The apartment was small but has everything you need. The toilet is outside the apartment in the hallway, but you get used to this quickly and I never saw someone. The apartment was  located central to everything (Subways, Times Square, Central Park, Madison Square Garden, Empire State Building). Would definitely recommend the room![QWERTY123]Communication with Luiz was excellent, he replied without prompt to my messages. Arrival of my flight was delayed but Luiz was very flexible and waiting for me in the Appartment and showed me around.

Room is rather small but as its anyway only required for sleeping absolutey fine. Location of the Flat is perfect, Underground & Busses are very close, max 10 minutes walking to the Times Square. I can only recommend staying in the flat of Luiz.[QWERTY123]I highly recommend staying with Luiz if you are visiting NY. The apartment is well located in Times Sq, within walking distance to metro and major attractions. The room is also well designed, with a comfortable queen size bed and Netflix for entertainment. Luiz went the extra mile to provide me with a metro pass and also stayed up late so he could chat with me before I left. While the toilet is outside the hallway, it is just small inconvenience for what you are getting.[QWERTY123]Luiz was a great host and his place is in an awesome location! I hardly saw Luiz myself as I was out and about mostly being it was my first time in NYC.  The interactions we had were great, and he is a nice guy. The room is perfect size for one and/or 2 people. I will definitely go with Luiz again if I were to travel there alone another time. Time square and the subway station are walking distances (2-4 blocks) plus the area is filled with places to eat so you really do not have to go far for good food.  Thank you again Luiz! :)[QWERTY123]Great place to stay right next to Times Square. Clean and comfortable bed. Luiz is super friendly and helpful.[QWERTY123]I had some great days staying with Luiz! I didn't see him much, but when I saw him he was very kind and friendly. Check in was super easy, I texted him when I landed and was ready for my arrival. The apartment is just like the pictures. Very comfortable with tv and Netflix in room.
I would definitely try and book with Luiz again![QWERTY123]Luiz was enormously helpful, friendly, and welcoming, not to mention very flexible with my fluctuating arrival time. The location can't be beat; it's within walking distance of the subway, Times Square, and Penn Station. Plenty of restaurants are nearby and the Hell's Kitchen Flea Market is across the street on weekends. The room itself is clean and comfy, with air-conditioning and WiFi, and it comes with access to a kitchenette, which is very handy. Luiz is offering a fantastic bargain![QWERTY123]Good Time on New-York on this apt 
Luis is very frendly 
20min to Walt to time square this is amazing 
The place is perfect 
When I come back I come here !!![QWERTY123]Small but cozy and clean place, perfect for a stay in New York City.  I didn't meet Luiz but he was easy to reach through messages and answered really quick. Uncomplicated arrival and depature.[QWERTY123]Luiz m'a attendu, même si sortir de l'aéroport a été plus long que prevu, et que je suis arrivé très tard. J'ai eu du mal à comprendre certaines indications pour aller du métro à l'immeuble, mais c'est parce que je ne connaissais pas la ville et qu'il est difficile de s'orienter de nuit. Par contre la douche et les toilettes sont absolument minuscules, et celles-ci se bouchent aisément. Heureusement qu'il y a une ventouse à disposition.
Le wifi est parfois lent.[QWERTY123]A lovely stay in this great city.  Very comfortable and Luiz was very friendly and helpful.[QWERTY123]This small, clean apartment is located in Hell's Kitchen, a central part of Manhattan. I don't know New York at all and this was the perfect spot to base myself for job interviews. The price was very competitive compared to other places to stay in the area. 

Luiz was super nice and flexible about arrival times. He was very accessible and helpful.

There is a cool Irish pub with actual Irish waiters just under the apartment as well.

I highly recommend this listing.[QWERTY123]Luiz's place was comfortable, clean and conveniently located. It was very easy to move around the city and also to Jfk AirPort. The neighborhood was safe but there were many homeless people living in the block. Nevertheless there were shops and Bars open 24hs that made me feel safe.
Luiz was very flexible and patient with my arrival and departure times and very easy to reach in case I needed something.
I would definetely stay in bis place again.
[QWERTY123]Luiz was a great host who answered all upcoming questions pretty fast. The appartment is right in the middle of everything - so you dont have do drive far to see all the highlights of Manhattan. 5 stars![QWERTY123]Fantastic location! Great value for money[QWERTY123]Luiz was the sweetest. The apartment was clean and comfortable but most importantly the location was great.
Def would come again[QWERTY123]Everything was perfect. Luiz was very nice and flexible with my arriving time. The room was clean and I felt safe. The toilet is outside the appartment, but is only 5 meters away from the appartement door and is on the same floor, so this was fine for me for the two nights. Thanks for the nice time im NY![QWERTY123]The apartment was cozy, comfortable & clean. Luiz responded quickly to my messages & was flexible with check in & check out times! The place is amazing to explore the city by bus, metro or just by foot. Most of the major sights are near by. The neighborhood was interesting, cultural mix with good restaurants and bars. 

I would stay here again and would recommend it.[QWERTY123]In terms of location, the flat is fantastic!  I chose this flat because I want to be near Times Square and the theatre district - very accessible! 
The flat is clean.  The room is small, but still okay with me.  If you are  tall,  you might find the bedroom and shower area small including the toilet (ie, toilet is located on the hallway outside of the room). Nevertheless, this room is comfortable for me.  
Flat is walking distance (about 5-7 mins) from Port Terminal Authority, so I just took a bus from here on my way to JFK airport. Again, very convenient. 
Cleber is very responsive. He answers messages fast. 
Thank you Cleber (aka Luiz!) 
I will consider this flat again when I visit NYC. 
[QWERTY123]Luiz war ein sehr freundlicher und zuvorkommender Gastgeber.[QWERTY123]Awesome value for its location!  I had a great time staying here.  It has all the basic necessities that you need and it's only a 10-12 minute walk to Times Square and Penn Station, which was great since I traveled to NYC by train.  I would definitely stay here again![QWERTY123]It's in a great location and is very clean - pretty much everything you need![QWERTY123]Todo perfecto, en especial la ubicación del apartamento, muy cerca de Times Square y de zonas de interés.[QWERTY123]Luiz was a great host, easy to communicate with and friendly. The place has a good location and the price is ok. But the bathroom is very small and u have to get dressed to go outside to the toalett.[QWERTY123]Everything was great and true to the listing--just as the other reviewers reported.  Luiz is an awesome host.[QWERTY123]Good place nice host.
Toilet is outside of room and share with same floor[QWERTY123]All the raving reviews are true. This apartment truly is such a great catch. Such a low price and such a central location. Last times I've been to NYC I've had to spend time and money on buses and taxies because there wasn't any subway nearby. Some may find the fact that the toilet is located outside the apartment an annoyance, but it's locked and clean. The room itself and bath were very clean, and you do get a full featured kitchen with fridge and microwave.
You really can't complain when you pay so little and get a clean room, comfy bed in such a central location.
The only minor downsides I can come up with is that the WiFi was a bit weak and the room was a bit cold. Other than that - will *definitely* come back.[QWERTY123]화장실이 바깥에있지만 그것대로 좋았어요 깨끗하고 2인이 방 하나씩 쓸수있어서 친구랑 와도 좋을것같네용! 위치도 매우 좋아용[QWERTY123]the room is cozy and warm thruout winter. his apartment is equip with essentials you need. good stay.[QWERTY123]Luiz's place is great, and just what I needed when I came into New York for a conference. I was looking for a place to stay that was central, budget-friendly, and safe (since I'd be walking back at night by myself). The apartment is exactly as advertised - it's small but functional, with a lot of natural light from the windows, and you share the common area (kitchen) with whoever is staying in the other bedroom. I was given keys at check-in with a separate key for my room, so felt comfortable leaving my stuff in there during the day. The street entrance and the building hallways were all clean and well-lit, and I felt very safe even when I was coming in late at night. The room itself has a spacious armoire with hangers to store your clothes, along with the bed, a side table, and a television. As mentioned in the description, the toilet is in a separate tiny room out in the hallway, but it's only a few steps away - and the shower (which is what I care about) is inside the apartment. I stayed there during the winter, and the apartment stayed a comfortable temperature the whole time I was there (though there was a small space heater provided in the room in case I got cold). 

Overall a great stay! I'd definitely recommend it for younger folks who are looking for a convenient, budget-friendly place to sleep in between days of exploring the city.[QWERTY123]Central location, Times Square is just a few blocks away. Luiz is a great host and made check-in and check-out very easy. Apartment is very clean. Room is small and restroom is outside of the apartment but good value for money for NYC standards![QWERTY123]Luiz was a great host and I enjoyed my stay.  He was accommodating of my schedule, and was there waiting during check-in.[QWERTY123]Luiz was an excellent host, with timely updates, friendly interactions and accurate descriptions. The location is unbeatable. Brilliant.[QWERTY123]Exactly as advertised. Clean, safe, cozy apartment in a great location. Great for first time NYC visitors that are working with a budget, and who really only need a place to sleep and shower. Would definitely stay here again.[QWERTY123]Terrific.[QWERTY123]Great location. The room was cozy and clean. Wi-fi was a bit slow, but it's a good value for the price.[QWERTY123]Luiz is a really good host! He helped me a lot during my stay![QWERTY123]Luiz was a great host, and was patient when my flight was unexpectedly delayed. The room was clean and cozy, and was in the perfect location for my trip.[QWERTY123]Primero para empezar luiz es una persona que responde a todas tus consultas y súper agradable. De todas formas a mí me recibió una amiga de el Carol súper buena conmigo y me explico todo con respecto al apartamento, el apartamento es muy cómodo limpio y muy bien ubicado si queres conocer Manhattan. Cerca de las estaciones de subte. Súper recomendable este apartamento.[QWERTY123]A great place!comfortable and convenient!Located close to Time Square,I can go almost anywhere on foot at Manhattan. Above all, Luiz and Carol were a friendly host!Well I think you can choose here!(^_^)and I'll again(^_^)[QWERTY123]Very comfy bed, great location![QWERTY123]Me alojé en la habitación más pequeña por 10 días. La ubicación es inmejorable. El barrio es muy seguro con tiendas, bares y restaurantes. Caroline me recibió muy bien, ofreciéndome todo lo que pueda necesitar. El apartamento está muy bien equipado. La habitación en la que me alojé es muy pequeña, pero tiene espacio suficiente para lo que necesitaba. El cuarto de baño está en el pasillo (lo sabía de la publicación antes que reservé) que no es muy cómoda pero realmente te acostumbras, además de que no pasar mucho tiempo en el apartamento. La ducha también es muy pequeña, aunque limpio y caliente. También te acostumbras a ella. Nada puede eclipsar la ubicación, la atención, la limpieza y el equipamiento del apartamento.
Durante mis 10 días compartí el apartamento con 3 mujeres diferentes que estaban ocupando y dejando la otra habitación que el apartamento posee (mucho más grande). Las tres mujeres fueron muy amables, silecionsas y recomendadas para este tipo de convivencia.
Estoy agradecido a Luiz y Caroline por haberme recibido. Espero volver pronto.[QWERTY123]I didn't get a chance to meet Luiz in person, but I met his friend and she was lovely. Actually I was so stupid that I locked myself out from the house and didn't bring anything with me. I borrowed someone's phone to contact Luiz from airbnb messages and it was a fast response (many thanks for that!) And his friend also rushes to my help eventhough she was in the middle of her work (sorry and thank you so much!!).
The place is quite small but it wasn't a problem at all if you just look for a place to sleep. Location-wise: perfect! You can walk everywhere in manhattan. 
Overall, fast response, easy check in and attentive. Can't ask for anything more! Thank you so much![QWERTY123]La mejor experiencia![QWERTY123]Un apartamento funcional y barato en el centro de NYC. Perfecto para una estancia corta.[QWERTY123]Simple and efficient, this place is great if you're visiting NYC for NYC. The location is centrally located with great walk-ability to both public transportation and key midtown tourist spots. Food is abundant close by, and the host was even kind enough to give insider recs! Quick check-in and check-outs. Room was small, cozy, and AC-supplied. Would definitely recommend for other urban hikers![QWERTY123]Muy buena ubicacion. A cuadras de time square. Luiz y Carol estan siempre disponible por cualquier cosa. Super recomendable[QWERTY123]Petit studio proche de la sortie du Lincoln tunnel, proche des restaurants, du métro et du bus. Le studio est composé de 2 chambres, donc on partage la cuisine, la salle de bain et les toilettes avec un autre bnb. La salle de bain est très petite (baignoire-douche + 1 lavabo) et les toilettes sont sur le palier. Le stockage des valises après le checkout n'est pas possible, mais il y a un storage à 2 rues de l'appartement ($10 par valise). 
[QWERTY123]Very central. Easy access to public transit. Very convenient and clean.[QWERTY123]Luiz est très un bon hôte, il m'a bien conseillé et accueillit. Son appartement est certe pas très grand mais idéal pour les voyageurs solitaires, il est parfaitement bien placé et quand on connaît les prix a Time Square ... le rapport qualité prix est au rendez vous et suis très satisfait de mon séjour à New York ![QWERTY123]You should stay here! Amazing place, amazing host.[QWERTY123]Luiz was very friendly and accommodating.[QWERTY123]It's located about 15 minutes walk from Times Square.
The bathroom and toilet size are very small. The toilet is separate from the house. It's likely to be suitable for travelers looking for accommodations that are located close to the city with reasonable price.[QWERTY123]A propriedade é bem localizada e de lá é fácil o transporte por toda a cidade. Quarto, banheiro e apartamento bem pequenos, porém muito limpos e aconchegantes. Única ressalva fica por conta do sanitário, que fica em uma área comum do prédio (contudo sempre trancado com chave).[QWERTY123]The room was just what I needed for my weekend trip to NYC. I felt both safe and comfortable in my stay here. I highly recommend it to anyone who wants an affordable place to stay in a fantastic location![QWERTY123]Great, affordable spot not far from the heart of the city. Luiz was available to help whenever needed. Perfect for a quick stay.[QWERTY123]I was in New York for a seminar nearby to Luiz's room and it was so nice to come back after a long day to a clean, comfortable space that felt safe and inviting. The only minor inconvenience was the toilet being down the hall but that was never a problem. The place is small but a terrific value if you just need a place to sleep.[QWERTY123]Hells Kitchen from Luiz's place on up is transformed to a thriving neighborhood.  I would stay here again even at a greater price if it magically had a toilet in the Apartment.  At this price, I was okay to go down the hall and hope I didn't disturb anyone when I got up through the night.[QWERTY123]O apartamento tem uma localização excelente, fica muito fácil se deslocar pela cidade. A limpeza é irretocável. A Arlete foi muito gentil e solicita em tudo que necessitei. Os únicos problemas que encontrei foram: privada fora do apartamento e chuveiro com pressão de água muito fraco.[QWERTY123]Great location. Very clean. Very responsive. Overall great value.

Thanks luiz[QWERTY123]Для центра города цена нормальная. Условия не удобны для длительного проживания. Если вы едете на 2-3 дня, этот вариант для вас. Так же надо иметь тапочки, чтобы можно было комфортно ходить по дому и в туалет, который находится вне квартиры[QWERTY123]The room is exactly as described. Great location. Very close to metro and restaurants. Ideal for those who travel alone and want to save money.[QWERTY123]Great location[QWERTY123]Luiz is a dedicated and attentive host who cares that his guests are well received and taken care of. The communication was very prompt and positive, and he made check-in and check-out a breeze. His apartment is in a great location and the neighborhood felt very safe. The unit was also very clean and uncluttered.

The toilet in the hallway isn't as inconvenient as it sounds--it helps that it's dedicated to the unit. The bathroom inside the apartment is tiny, but if you just need a place to sleep and get ready, it will suffice. 

The unit was also really quiet at night, which makes for a solid night of sleep. (Note, however, that there is ongoing construction on the lot next door, so if you're in the loft bedroom, don't plan to sleep in past 6 or 7 a.m.) 

When I booked, I wasn't aware that there was another bedroom in this unit where another Airbnb guest might stay (I assumed I was staying with the host). It can be jarring to discover this upon arrival (it's happened to me before), but in this case, I shared the kitchen space and bathroom with perhaps one of the sweetest women I've ever met. I do bring this up because I'm not sure whether it's explicitly stated on the listing, and this isn't something that should surprise a traveler. Overall, however, this place was a great value and I would recommend it![QWERTY123]Had a good stay, everything as advertised was correct. Thanks.[QWERTY123]It was a great room and Luiz was so helpful making for a very comfortable stay! The price was right and the location made it easy to see the sights of New York. Would stay again.[QWERTY123]Me quedé en la habitación pequeña por una semana. El apartamento es tal y como cabe esperar. Muy tranquilo y cálido. Perfectamente ordenado y limpio, y con todo lo que puedas necesitar. Al tema del baño fuera del apartamento te acostumbras, y como cuenta, es exclusivo para uso del apartamento. En cuanto a localización, estás realmente cerca de Times Square, dónde puedes llegar perfectamente en 5 minutos andando. Ahí tienes comunicación por metro a cualquier punto de Manhattan. Y lugares para comer o cenar cercanos no faltan. Muy recomendable si pretendes hacer turismo y necesitas dónde dormir.[QWERTY123]Location~~~
Is the best.
You can walking to the best spots. The apartment in 2nd floor,so its not difficult. Hot water bathroom in this winter time is the saviour. Internet works well,and the amenities are complete. The only challenge is toilet. Since its in the outside, Dont forget to bring the house key! But other than that. All awesome![QWERTY123]Walking distance to Times Square, Subways and food.[QWERTY123]Very clean and close to everything on a walking distance![QWERTY123]Positive aspects: very good location, clean, excellent comunication. 

Negative aspects: the smallest apt. 2B has a super small restroom and the toilet is outside of the apartment in the hallway. The room is extremely small and cold.[QWERTY123]El departamento es excelente. Muy buena ubicación, todas las atracciones de Manhattan quedan a pocos minutos a pie. También hay varias estaciones de metro a pocos metros. Confortable, con lo necesario para una placentera estancia en New York. En la zona hay cientos de tiendas, bares, supermercados, lavandería y lo que uno imagina. En media hora andando se llega a Central Park y en quince a Times Square.
Luis no estaba en la ciudad y me recibió Tony. Estoy muy agradecido por su cordialidad, su ayuda, sus consejos y su constante atención. ¡Gracias Tony!
Volvería a alojarme aquí en un próximo viaje. Gracias![QWERTY123]The location is excellent, maybe a five minute walk from Times Square where you will find glitz, glamor, and subways to everywhere.  It is also a 10 - 15 min walk to the quite excellent and beautiful New York Public Library.  The restroom is in the hallway, so bring flip flops or something you can slip on easily if you have to go in the middle of the night.  The apartment has compact charm, it feels like living in an O'Henry short story.[QWERTY123]The host canceled this reservation 5 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.[QWERTY123]Luiz was great. The bedroom was quite small but it’s as it looks in the photos. You can’t  be a light sleeper - there is construction right next to the window pretty early in the morning. If you’re sensitive to using a private bathroom, the location of toilet is a bit uncomfortable. Overall, it was clean.[QWERTY123]Pros: Localização perfeita.
Contra: Banheiro péssimo e vaso sanitário fica fora do apartamento no corredor. Apartamento bem antigo.[QWERTY123]Great value, nice location- lots of stores nearby. The building is a bit old, it is great if you just need bed and amenities.  Appreciate hospitality of Luis.[QWERTY123]Bath room is tiny. Toilet is outside the atp in a hallway. Heating was not working well. Not worth the price.[QWERTY123]ทำเลดีมาก ราคาดี 
แปลกตรงที่ห้องส้วมอยู่ด้านนอก แต่ข้อนี้ยอมรับได้เพราะรู้ตั้งแต่ตอนจอง  แต่มันก็ไม่สะดวกเท่าไรถ้าอยากเข้าห้องน้ำตอนกลางคืน

ข้อเสีย คือ wifi ใช้ไม่ได้อยู่ 1 คืน จาก 3 คืน
และสื่อสารกันนานพอสมควรกว่าจะยอมให้ฝากกระเป๋าได้ก่อนเวลา check in[QWERTY123]The location is so good, it's so close to times square and Broadway that it's very convenient to go anywhere. There is also a very good car life supermarket nearby.[QWERTY123]This is my second time staying with Luiz. Checkin was a breeze even though Luiz couldn’t do it himself everything was ready with someone to meet me. The location for NY is amazing, you just can’t beat it. There were a few problems with the boiler in the building whilst I was there, but this was sporadic and clearly out of the hosts control. Thanks again Luiz.  I look forward to next time.[QWERTY123]Excelente lugar para descansar por la noche después de recorrer NY durante todo el día. Lugar limpio, con muy buen acceso a tiendas, bares, restaurantes, subway y monumentos turísticos de interés (a solo pocas cuadras de Times Square), además de quedar geográficamente en un sector bastante seguro para caminar en la noche. Sin duda volvería a este apartamento. Luiz es un muy buen anfitrión, amable, simpático, siempre atento y con buena disposición para responder ante cualquier duda que tengas. Recomiendo 100% este alojamiento.[QWERTY123]I had a very nice stay at Luiz's place.  The location is great, the room is small but comfortable (esp. the bed) and best of all for me, it is quiet.  The bathroom situation is a bit different but it took me back to my college days living in a dorm with shared bathrooms and having to take keys with you at night.  I would stay here again on a future trip.[QWERTY123]Luiz was great! Very responsive to an early check-in and the room was as promised and incredibly convenient to Times Square![QWERTY123]Great stay and value, everything was as expected and Luiz's team was friendly, helpful, and accommodating. Would return.[QWERTY123]Close to times square[QWERTY123]It's a nice place to stay with all the basic amenities. It's close to everything in Manhattan. Getting there from the airport was very easy and the hosts were very nice and helpful. The room was very clean, had everything that I needed and for a good value. I would certainly stay there again and recommend it to any future travelers.[QWERTY123]I had a great stay at Luiz's place. If you need a place to sleep, while exploring NYC, this is your place. You have a small room thats has airconditioning and a comfortable bed. The location is great, just by Times Square, Hells Kitchen and Penn station. You can explore NYC by foot foot from here. Flexible checkin and checkout with Luiz's friend Tony. Good communication. All in all great value for money![QWERTY123]Amazing location, beautiful little flat with a super comfy bed, the only trouble I could see was that the shared toilet was very small but I didn't find that to be too much of a problem when only staying for a couple of nights[QWERTY123]The location is a great advantage of this apartment. Luiz and Tony are very responsive.
However, the room/bathroom/toilet are extremely small, so not convenient for a longer stay.  Quite tidy place, but noisy at nights. There are many homeless just in front of the building, but I was never bothered by them.[QWERTY123]It’s a comfortable and convenient place. Near and subway, close to Times Square. Good apt good host.[QWERTY123]very good location at Manhattan[QWERTY123]The house is as it appears in the pictures. Quite clean, the bed is comfortable and the wifi works well. Bathroom and on floor toilet are really small (you can barely move inside). A little overpriced due to very central location (although Hell's Kitchen is not nice at all), with (Email hidden by Airbnb) munication back and forth was easy but, for me, it was the rudest check-in experience on airbnb. I would suggest this place only if you need an overnight stay in Hell's Kitchen.[QWERTY123]This was my first time staying in an Airbnb that was shared with a host.  I found it at the last minute in a pinch when visiting for a last minute work thing in NYC.  Luiz is a wonderful, friendly, accommodating host and it was a joy to stay at his place!  You get the real NYC compact living space experience with quirks like the toilet being down the hall from the apartment (actually surprisingly nice arrangement for privacy in a petite place), and I can't imagine a better person to share a little apartment with!  I felt welcome, comfortable, and had all the basics that I needed to feel happy to get home from work and relax in a new city.  I would absolutely stay with Luiz again in a heartbeat.  My trip would have felt much more challenging if I didn't have such a safe, cheerful, and central place to come back to at the end of the day  Thanks Luiz!  See you again soon![QWERTY123]Luiz is a terrific host who is very kind and funny. He was super accommodating and went above and beyond every step of the way. The location of his flat is superb. I would stay here again and recommend his listing to others.[QWERTY123]A nice quiet apartment close to midtown with easy access to public transport.  Great value for the price.[QWERTY123]Luiz was a great host. He went out of his way to ensure I was able to get into his place. He went above and beyond to ensure I was okay! Thank you Luiz ![QWERTY123]I was very happy with my Stay at Luiz's apartment. He was a great host with great communication. The place was safe, cozy and clean as advertised. It was close to quite a few resturants and bars which i did not get to try. Most convienent of all, it was very close to a bus route which traveled to Newark Airport in New Jersey. As in the description, the Bathroom with sink is in apartment but the toilet room is in hallway and is about 10 feet away. They are small but it's nothing that can't be adjusted too. My favorite features were the window a/c unit which kept me cool throughout the night, towel provided, Armoire which had more the enough room to hang my clothes and a very very comfy bed. I would definitely stay here again.[QWERTY123]El alojamiento está ubicado en pleno centro, ubicación buenísima. Es pequeño, si uno es físicamente grande se le complicaría, pero yo no tuve problema. La cama era muy cómoda. Luiz fue super amable al esperarme cuando llegué ya que me había retrasado, y siempre respondió rápidamente a todos los mensajes. Gracias![QWERTY123]El departamento está muy bien ubicado, cerca de Time square y de estaciones de metro. Es pequeño y solo el inodoro está en un cuartito en el pasillo.. no es nada del otro mundo.. súper recomendable si uno está pocos días en NY y piensa recorrer está incansable ciudad..[QWERTY123]It is in a very prime location walkable distance from time square port terminal station. Surroundings is considered safe. The room got an aircon. However, it would be great for a better bathroom and toilet condition. 

Luiz is so kind to pick me up at the entrance and assist me to carry my luggage to the first floor of the building. 

I would consider this is a good and fair deal for accommodation in NYC.[QWERTY123]Great value and very close to all tourist destinations[QWERTY123]*Luiz is very responsive, and welcomed me in the apartment.
*The description is very accurate and when you reach to the apt you don't find any surprises.
*I needed to delay my check-out and Luiz helped me with that.
*The apartment location is extremely central and close to the port port authority.
*bathroom is small and not very comfortable.
*The apartment and the room are very clean.
*Luiz is a great Host! Thank you Luiz.[QWERTY123]The room is small but convenient and close to the center of Manhattan! You can do everything by walk and the host is nice and available. The apartment is clean and quiet as well.[QWERTY123]The place is very close to the theatre district."	40.755265906956794	-73.99290903858031	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/26362	1	59.0	0.775

It's was a good trip for me and my friend, thank you Rana.[QWERTY123]Rana is an excellent host and welcomed us over (Hidden by Airbnb) as her friend, Wendy, met us in person to help us get settled. The location is five stars! Surrounded by delicious restaurants and cute shops while only a seven minute walk to the subway. Highly recommend it if your looking to visit Brooklyn and Manhattan.[QWERTY123]I really enjoyed my stay. Rana was a very responsive host. She always answered my questions immediately. She arranged a neighbor to give me the key card and show me around the apartment upon my arrival- who was also very nice. I am usually concerned that Airbnb is not as clean as hotels, but this apartment is super CLEAN and spacious! I liked the bed in particular, with firm mattress, clean and quality sheets.  I felt quite relaxed the whole time in the apartment.  And the location is ideal, only a couple of blocks away from Prospect Park Station. I definitely recommend this place.[QWERTY123]My boyfriend and I stayed at Rana’s apartment for 3 days and it was nothing short of perfect for our stay. Everything you need is in walking distance and everywhere you need to go is a short 15-25 minute drive. The apartment was clean and it had a decent balcony that overlooked Brooklyn. Would definitely stay here again.[QWERTY123]The host canceled this reservation 11 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.[QWERTY123]Rana’s place is really spacious. It’s the perfect size for two people. She has great communication and the location was great. Would definitely stay here again!"	40.65943533447946	-73.96238026405102	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/12627	2	150.0	0.9
95	12937	"I had an excellent time at Orestes' place in NYC.

Quiet place with a private entrance to come back home at whatever time you want without disturbing anyone.

Laundromat around the corner and the closest subway is literally one block away, where the 7 train goes all the way into Times Square. Also two blocks away you have the E train that also goes into Manhattan and the G train that goes into Brooklyn.

In the area there's still a cozy and cheap diner that's open 24/7, a few stores to get supplies and a few other places of interest. Location was excellent, 10 minutes away from everything.

The room was great and packed with a mini fridge, coffee maker, TV, a sofa, full size bed and walk-in closet. There was also a private bathroom that had everything you needed and a very good shower.

There's also a garden out back where you can go outside in the mornings and just relax, eat breakfast, etc.

Orestes was a great host and gave me a lot of good spots to go sightseeing. Good person to chat with and quite knowledgeable about the city.

I think that for the price, you simply can't get any better.[QWERTY123]Orestes was a great host and a nice guy.  The room was clean, comfortable, and cozy.  Also, his historic home is gorgeously decorated, really reflecting the level of detail that Orestes has in ensuring a nice experience for his guests.  The location was very convenient - easy parking and 1 block away from the subway.  We had a great time staying here and I would definitely recommend it![QWERTY123]This is very upscale and chic lodging in Hunters Point.  Everything about the room is positive, especially the warmth and friendliness of the host.  It is convenient (less than 2 blocks) to the subway and I was in the city in 10 minutes.  Lots of restaurants within walking distance and small coffee shops, laundromat, delis, etc.  It is a safe area, and you will especially love the totally restored units to the 1880s feeling, but with modern conveniences.[QWERTY123]Great space, fabulous garden and very private.  My visiting inlaws stayed there and were very comfortable.  I would recommend to anyone.[QWERTY123]My stay with Orestes couldn't have been better. He is a warm, kind and gentle person with a fabulous place and a sweet dog. I enjoyed being surrounded by beautiful artwork in a serene and rich environment that was created in Orestes' vision. If the weather had been warmer, I would have spent some time in his garden oasis. The location is convenient to midtown and Brooklyn without the Manhattan price tag. Plus, there's a great coffee shop/restaurant around the corner and an authentic 24hr. diner in the neighborhood.[QWERTY123]The host canceled my reservation 10 days before arrival.[QWERTY123]I had a great time staying here with my family. Orestes was extremely nice and thoughtful of us as guests. The room is lovely and the bathroom is great. As a whole it was a relaxing week here. With a beautiful garden and access to everything we need regarding accommodation. Better than any hotel I would say. And Orestes I thought I left my shoes there. They are pretty old anyway so you can throw them out! Thanks!![QWERTY123]Great host,great location. I hope to stay there again very very soon![QWERTY123]We wanted a place to stay close to everything but quiet and comfortable and we got it.   Orestes is a great guy and his place is beautiful.  We could be  in central Manhatten in10 minutes, the 7 line is a 2 minute walk just around the corner.  But when we were tired we could relax here, in perfect peace and quiet.    We always felt safe and welcome.   Thanks Orestes- we'll definitely come back.[QWERTY123]What a wonderful holiday and a wonderful place to stay! We were unsure about staying in Queens is opposed to Manhattan, worried that we might feel slightly out of the way, but we had absolutely no need to worry at all - the subway is round the corner (next to the best chinese take-away ever!) and really does take you to the thick of it within ten minutes. There is also a lovely river walk about 15 minutes away which give you the most wonderful views of Manhattan, and there are loungers to relax on at the waters edge!
The house is absolutely beautiful (you can tell Orestes is an architect), you have your own front door and the room is plenty big enough (I stayed with a friend - she slept on the double futon which was very comfy). It also has air conditioning. The bathroom is stunning, with a huge steam room/shower, and it is not shared with anyone else. We were given plenty of fresh towels most days. Orestes' office is on the same floor and then the back garden is just lovely - a great place to sit and eat a takeaway or, as we did, sit and have breakfast.
As a host Orestes was faultless really! He was very friendly and helpful, and we enjoyed telling him about our day - he was happy to recommend places to see and to eat, but also totally respected our privacy and we felt would have probably left us totally to our own devices if we'd wanted. He also had a lovely little dog called Kiki!
There was no weird faff with deposits or cleaning fees, everything was simple and wonderful. I honestly can't wait to go back and I want to take all of my friends. Don't hesitate to stay here.
Thanks Orestes, it was fabulous x[QWERTY123]My husband and I stayed for a week in January; the room and bathroom were warm, very clean, visually appealing, and comfortable.  We met Orestes briefly, as he was out of town most of the time, and he is extremely hospitable and helpful.  Chris, who was around the rest of the time, was also kind and available for any questions.
The location is convenient to a grocery store, decent diner, and several subway lines; it's pretty simple to get to Queens, Brooklyn, or Manhattan.
Future guests should be aware that while the guest room itself might be non-smoking, the rest of the house isn't.  Most of the evenings the cigarette smoke was unavoidable, though not too bad if you kept the door to the guest room shut.  (Being first-trimester-pregnant, my nose and nausea levels felt sensitive to this, but I imagine it wouldn't be an issue for most folks, unless you had asthma or some other sensitivity.)
On whole, it was a good home base for our week in New York; everyone was friendly and the accommodations were nice.[QWERTY123]Orestes was a great host!  He was very helpful with any questions I asked him, and I had a lot :)  It was my first time in NYC, and he definitely made it easier with his recommendations (especially when it came to public transportation.)  He has a beautiful home.  I wanted to take that shower home with me!  Heaven!  Great location too!  The E train and 7 train were about a block away, and there is a 24 hour diner right around the corner![QWERTY123]We stayed two nights at Orestes' and it was, from far, our best AirBnB experience ever. The very spacious room is in a Queens historic district (very close to 5ptz, PS1 Moma and a typical American Diner...). We had everything we needed (wifi, clean and big private bathroom, comfortable  bed...). We absolutely recommend this place (which is only one stop from Manhattan - Lexington Av. /49th).[QWERTY123]In the beginning we wanted to stay at a hotel in central Manhattan, but fortunately for us we saw Orestes room on the internet and it was an even better place to stay. It was great to be able to withdraw to the Queens peace and quiet after a long day in Manhattan - and only one subway stop away. Orestes house is located in a historically beautiful street and the room is comfortably furnished with a touch of creative people. Nice bathroom with a shower big enough for two and the sunny garden was beautiful.

It was nice to meet Orestes and Cristiàns hospitality, helpfulness and kindness and Kikki, the dog of the house, always greeted us welcome. We felt very welcome and our expectations were fully met. We will certainly return to this place again when we visit New York next time and can only give our warmest recommendations to this place.
[QWERTY123]A dream week in a fantastic place and a great guy named Orestes. Everything was much more than expected including the location just one stop from Manhattan by the airtrain/subway. Hope to go back there as soon as possible. Thank you Orestes.[QWERTY123]Great host, very nice and understanding. Location was fantastic and interior photos don't do the place justice, its even nicer than it looks. Lots of good restaurants in the area too.[QWERTY123]Orestes was an amazing host.  Very welcoming and warm and was able to give us advice for train routes to take and restaurants to visit!  His house and the room were amazing.  His place is very clean, comfortable, and extremely well decorated!  We loved the amazing shower and the adorable dog!

I can say without a doubt, that we'll be referring some friends to him and if we have the opportunity to come back to New York again we will definitely be staying here again.

Highly recommended![QWERTY123]Orestes is a great host.  His place is amazing.  The room is more like a suite in that it has a couch to watch TV in addition to a very comfotable bed.  There is also a small fridge  and coffee machine.  During our stay the temp was over 100 degrees outside but the room has great A/C so we were very comfortable.  Also, the room is super quiet.  The bathroom is fantasic....huge!  Great dog named KIKI too.

The location is 1 block away from the 7 train.  You can't beat this.  10 min to Grand Central Station and Central Park....15 min to Times Square.  The neighbor hood has many great places to eat.  I highly recommend LIC Cafe which is 1 block away.  

This is the ONLY place to stay in NYC!!![QWERTY123]Orestes is a very friendly and helpful host. We felt very welcome at his place.
The location is very convenient for a city break in NYC and especially Manhattan with 5 subway lines only a couple of walking minutes away.
The room has all you need and the bed was very comfortable.

Thank you Orestes - we will come back![QWERTY123]About location:
Great location! 5 min from Manhattan. Great neighborhood with laundry service, few market places to provide us all we needed and an Indian restaurant right over the corner. 3 minute walk to the subway!

About the house:
Great room! big. with A/C, T.V, fridge and coffee table. Towels available in the room and in the shower. All clean and neat. Big private shower. Big beautiful yard to enjoy breakfast.  Perfect. We really enjoyed staying there.

About the owner:
We had a nice conversation over the phone. I felt comfortable with my decision to book his place .Orestes the owner had his friend Gabbi waiting for us when we arrived. She guided us through out our visit and made us feel at  home.  She was kind enough to spend time on the computer, explaining us where to go and how to get there, as well as many important tips that made the difference in our trip. We were lucky to have her.

[QWERTY123]Orestes and Christian are great hosts and would love to come back and stay with them. Great location and quiet. The shower is AWESOME!![QWERTY123]just gonna start by saying ""amazing""!!

we had such a great time at Orestes home and what a lovely home it is. we received a warm welcome and were made to feel at home. Everything about our stay couldn't have gone any better. Orestes gave us plenty info about the area, highlighting interesting places to eat and gave us travel advice which saved us a bit. We have kept in touch and will be going back next year. We just wish we were still there.

Many thanks Orestes
Was great meeting you!!

Adam and Sinead.
[QWERTY123]The house located near subway only a few minutes walk. The room is comfortable and restroom is clean. I will stay here again if I plan to visit New York. Thank you Mr. Orates for a lovely place to stay,[QWERTY123]Designed by a gifted mind this place is an amazing spot to start discovering New York. The rooms and lavatories are very clean and it is obvious Orestes and Christian care about their home! It's very close to a Metro station which takes you to 5th Avenue and Central Park just within minutes. Well, when there isn't a superstorm approaching where most of the public transport gets shut down. But luckily we survived Sandy and felt very safe at this place. And on the day of our departure Orestes was kind enough to take us to that one Metro station which startet operating on a low level routine again and made it easy for us getting to Manhattan. 
However, as half of NYC was without electricity during our stay we have to come back and will hopefully stay here again![QWERTY123]We had a great time in Orestes .I can highly recommend  staying with him.The place is great,very close to Manhattan ,and we were glad choosing that place over the other and the cost connecting with being there.The place is  very well designed .I wish I could be that talanted,but I will steels some ideas anyway.We had great chat and helped us when needed,other wise we felt as we were there on our own.Book with confidence.[QWERTY123]This was my first experience with an Airbnb stay and it surpassed my expectations!  Orestes is a gracious host who made me feel very welcome, taking time to show me his home and tell me about the area. His home has a wonderfully warm ambiance that is reflected in the room (and private bath!) I stayed in...both clean and spacious.  This historic street is a beautiful neighborhood setting and two subway stations (there might be more but I was just getting my bearings!) are within a few minutes walk that take you right into Manhattan.  This Airbnb experience made for a perfect mini-getaway!  Thank you, Orestes![QWERTY123]Two words alone would be enough to describe staying at Orestes...Simply Amazing!!! Orestes’ home exudes a special warmness, also thanks to its interesting décor which comes from the mind of two very talented people. Orestes and Cristian are wonderful, friendly and warm hosts; they made us feel extremely welcome and at home from the moment we arrived. As for location, we couldn't have asked for a better one. The triplets are ideally located on a quiet historic street where we could rest peacefully after long days spent out & about, away from the hustle and bustle of the city. There are loads of nice restaurants (try LIC Market if you get the chance, great food & atmosphere!) and shops close by as well as a 24/7 diner; just minutes away from Manhattan by subway (with multiple train choices) and only a short walk away from the best view of the skyline you'll experience by far! The room itself is perfect in size, comfortable and very clean; it also has a sofa, TV, mini fridge, coffee maker and walk in wardrobe which, albeit small, is extremely handy! The bathroom has the best shower ever, amazing ...I still miss it & wish I could have taken it back with me ;) Last but not least, there is a lovely garden at the back where you can unwind, soak in the sun or have breakfast al fresco! We really couldn't have wished for better! Thank you Orestes and Cristian for opening your home to us and  for making our stay perfect. Already looking forward to my next stay :)

[QWERTY123]Staying in Orestes' suite was a great treat. It is comfortable, immaculate, and very tastefully and interestingly decorated. The bathroom/shower is amazing and there is a lovely outdoor garden in the back for when the weather is good. Orestes was welcoming, friendly, and helpful, but not obtrusive -- an ideal host. Long Island City is a very interesting location, lots to explore, and the proximity to Manhattan could not be better. We will most definitely try to stay with Orestes on our next visit to NYC.[QWERTY123]What a great location and comfortable, clean and charming place to stay for a visit to NYC.  All is just as presented in the description for this location.  Easy to get to from the airport, great location for use of the subway, safe and attractive, good food within one block and quiet, friendly accommodations.  You will not be disappointed if this is your choice. Orestes is a wonderful responsive host.[QWERTY123]A great place to stay! The suite is very comfortable, cosy, clean and quiet with a lovely garden and perfectly suited in a beautiful street.
And it is well located: very close to the metro (3 lines lead directly to midtown Manhattan) and good restaurants.

Orestes was very friendly and gave us lots of interesting tips for NY. This Suite is the perfect place to discover NY and was an excellent home to us. We highly recommend it.[QWERTY123]Our family of 3, including our 13 year old daughter recently stayed at Orestes' beautiful home.  The room and bathroom were very clean, spacious and very comfortable.  Sitting outside in a lovely garden having breakfast is something I would never had expected to do. The location is fantastic, we loved the quiet of Queen's and the short walk to the metro which quickly got us into Manhattan.  Orestes and Christian were very helpful and excellent hosts who made our trip run smoothly.  I wouldn't hesitate to highly recommend it to others and the next time I am in New York it would be my first choice.[QWERTY123]Very nice house and Superb location. Our family did enjoy great stay in Orestes House. It is good choice and we will definitely choose this house for next trip to New York.[QWERTY123]Very nice location, perfect for us. We really enjoyed staying with Orestes, he was very helpful and the house is just wonderful. Location if perfect (one stop from Manhattan, 5 mins walk to the subway) and the neighborhood is very nice and safe. The room and the bathroom are beautiful and breakfast in the garden was great.. but beware of the mosquitos, they love European tourists :D[QWERTY123]I was very disappointed with my first airbnb experience. I was expecting an intimate local experience with the benefit of getting an insider's take on my first visit to the fabulous city that is NY. Unfortunately, Orestes was away on holidays (which I only found out when I rang him a day before I arrived) the whole 5 days I was there. He said a good friend (who introduced herself as his neighbor) would be living there instead. The first day a non-English speaking house-cleaner was there to meet me to pass me the keys. Because I spent the first afternoon sightseeing I arrived to a quiet house at 10.30pm and spent the first night not knowing who was in the house. The next morning at the first sound of noises/footsteps in the house I went upstairs to wait to meet 'the neighbour' before she headed off to work. This was the only time I saw her in my stay but awoke every morning to the sounds of multiply people coming in and out of the only entrance which is through the bottom front door right next to do the guest bedroom.  I was never told who was going to be in the house and by the end of 5 days I counted at least 5 people, one other guy living in the same house (who never introduced himself), a dog walker and work colleagues of Orestes who made use of the 2 workstations in the same level as the bedroom for at least 2 of the days. One work collegue was working until 1 am one morning. Considering there is an opaque ceiling to floor window in the bathroom which is clearly visible from the working area I didn't feel comfortable taking a shower at night. Also my ""private"" bathroom was used by the work colleagues. Although I was out for most of the days, due to the wooden floor boards I could hear people walking/stomping around late at night and early mornings. The photos are accurate, the house is nice. However, the room you stay in is on the basement level along with 2 work place areas. There were written rules left including one never to lock the front door when you were inside (otherwise you can lock others out!). I never heard from Orestes, was never offered help or advice and had no communication who had access to the house.  Disappointing considering all the rave reviews. I would have felt safer and got a lot more personal attention and clearer communication staying in a hotel. My girlfriend who also stayed a couple of nights was also disappointed by the fact we were sightseeing 'blind' and that we had no idea who was in the upper levels of the house. For safer, more personal attention and less wasting time on subways I recommend staying in a hotel around East Village. P.S. my bed sheet was covered in dog hairs.[QWERTY123]We had a great stay at Orestes beautiful home. The roomes were exactly a described and we felt very at home and warmly welcomed. After a long day in Manhatten it was great to get in the subway for few minutes and relax in the quiet place, especially the garden.[QWERTY123]An extremely helpful and welcoming host into a house that we loved. The design features were fantastic and the shower is by far one of the best I have seen.
Orestes is a very knowledgeable and courteous man and I would advise his house to any b2b costumer.
We can't thank him enough for his help and hospitality. Hope to return one day[QWERTY123]Nuestra estancia ha sido confortable. Gran suite con una ducha excepcional. Orestes es un gran anfitrion y ofrece una gran confianza. Te da toda la informacion que le pidas. Conocimos tambien a 2 amigos suyos  Ray (escritor, le regaló un libro a mi hijo) e Ignacio muy atentos y educados. Teniamos todo lo necesario para el aseo (toallas, jabones,..), con nevera, cafetera con cafe,,, , seria interesante tener un pequeño microondas.
Sin duda recomiendo este sitio, metro a la vuelta de la esquina(1 min.), supermercado, buen barrio.. Es tan tipico y bonito que una noche rodaron una pelicula en la puerta de la casa.
Si vuelvo espero hospedarme en este sitio con Oreste.

Our stay was comfortable. Large suite with a fantastic shower. Orestes is a great host and provides great confidence. It gives you all the information you ask. 2 also met his friends Ray (writer, gave him a book to my son) and Ignacio very attentive and polite. We had everything you need for grooming (towels, soap, ..), with refrigerator, coffee maker with coffee,,,, it would be interesting to have a small microwave.
I definitely recommend this place, metro just around the corner (1 min.), Supermarket, nice neighborhood .. It is so typical and pretty shot a movie night at the door of the house.
If I look forward to staying in this place with Oreste.[QWERTY123]My daughter and I  were so pleased that we chose Orestes's beautiful place in  Long Island City Queens for our First B&B experience . He was there to meet us and he had allowed us to arrive an hour early. It was clean and airy and plenty of space allowed us to spread out . He let us settle in and offered to help out if we needed anything.  He also let us have our privacy, although he does use the downstairs space for work, it is not noisy or intrusive and we weren't there much in the day. 
We had a split stay in NY and the first leg we stayed in an impersonal Mid Town Hotel - Just like any other city BUT
Staying in  LIC Queens was a real treat, it is so unique and very close to the river, has awesome city skyline views plus we worked out the subs easy enough and it was as close as he says. It only took us 10 mins on the sub to get home at night!. You walk that much at least to a hotel, and Subs are everywhere.  It was really nice to come home to a quiet space every night.  We also appreciate healthy food options and found really great food at a quality., modern Food cellar supermarket in Long Island City! it was awesome with a huge range of wholesome, organic  salads and healthy choices and only 5 mins walk.
I would absolutely recommend you consider staying here, in a beautiful street, with quiet neighbourhood, a lovely, rare city garden as a treat and so very close to Manhattan.  It is great value all around. Orestes was polite, respectful and helpful as a host. Thanks again Orestes. 
Catherine. Brisbane[QWERTY123]This was our first experience with Airbnb and for sure not last. I can’t imagine better place to stay, really Orestes was perfect host. Unfortunately we do not have time to discuss more as we had been exploring city, but believe that this was not last time we had meet Orestes. :)
Orestes was every time available for our questions and helps us so much. I also really appreciate his big help during last day in NYC as we have been returning from East Hampton and need to leave our luggage for few hours due to late-night flight. Orestes helped us without any discussion.
Perfect for me was that not even house was beautiful but also Orestes is person you can rely on.
Before this experience we have been in NYC but we stayed in hotel, but as I said, no more! For everybody looking for place to stay in NYC this should be first option.
I nearly forgot the location (Website hidden by Airbnb) You have peace for sleep but so close to Manhattan. “Just one stop from Manhattan.” – exactly, take line 7 to Lexinton Ave…
My impressions from whole stay at Orestes’s beautiful house are hart to describe. I will remember this for long long time.
Unfortunately also our stay had one big disadvantage: we had to leave. :))) 
Orestes: Really thank you for everything. I am really happy to know you. 
RETURNING TO NYC? ONLY TO ORESTES’S PLACE!
 (Website hidden by Airbnb) 
[QWERTY123]The reservation was canceled 13 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.[QWERTY123]We loved our stay in Queens with Orestes. Beautiful apartment, fantastic location just a few metro stops from Manhattan, Orestes was very kind and welcoming. Without a doubt will stay with Orestes again next time we are in NYC.[QWERTY123]Great place to stay- very conveniently located, quiet (for NYC), and all-around pleasant. Good host with good communication and nice space. Orestes himself is considerate and pleasant.[QWERTY123]We had a great stay at Orestes place! The bedroom and bathroom were super clean, linen, towels and dishes were kindly provided. Perfect alternative to Manhattan as Times Square is just few minutes away with the subway. Very nice garden to have breakfast in the morning! Highlight was the amazing shower, wish I had such a bathroom myself![QWERTY123]Nous avons adoré notre séjour chez Orestes, tout était idéal : tout d'abord parce que c'est un hôte très accueillant, sa maison est magnifique, l'emplacement est très tranquille, situé dans une rue calme et on ne peut être plus proche du métro ! Les lignes de métro étaient parfaites pour se déplacer dans tout Manhattan et il y a même l'East Ferry à quelques blocs, suggéré par Orestes, qui nous a permis de découvrir les rives de l'East River sous un autre jour. Malgré nos horaires ""très touristiques"", Orestes est venu prendre de nos nouvelles et a su nous conseiller dans nos visites. Nous recommandons donc fortement de séjourner chez Orestes.

We really enjoyed staying at Orestes' home. Everything was perfect : Orestes is a very welcoming host, his house is magnificient, in a very quiet area, and peaceful street, you can't be closer from the subway ! Metro lines were perfect to move across all Manhattan and there was even East Ferry a few blocks ago, as Orestes suggested us, so we could discover East River sides. Even with our very ""touristic hours"", Orestes came to take news from you and he gave us advices. We recommand strongly to stay at Orestes' home ![QWERTY123]Superbe  maison a 1 station de Manhattan. Grace a Oreste, mon sejour a New York a ete formidable. Tres discret il est la si besoin et il m a aide  tous les matins a preparer mon programme avec de precieux conseils... Je recommande vivement cet hebergement. J y retournerai avec tres grand plaisir ![QWERTY123]Tracy and I had a wonderful time in New York and Orestes made it unforgettable with his generous hospitality.  This was our first time using airbnb and we can't be happier with experience. The room and bathroom was nice and clean, the bed comfortable, and everything was to our liking. The room was exactly as we expected. He even called us a car when we needed to get back to the airport. The subway station was a five minute walk and we got in and out of Manhattan with ease. We were very grateful for your hospitality. We hope to see you again in the future. Thank you again![QWERTY123]My wife, my 2 daughters and I recently stayed at Orestes’s place and we had a great time. The bedroom and the bathroom were very clean and comfortable. Our visit was wonderful!. He is an excellent host, very kind, and was very helpful with any questions we had. Orestes, thank you very much!.[QWERTY123]To resume, is was PERFECT !! Nous étions à la maison ! Chambre très comfortable, spacieuse, une salle de bain désign avec une cabine de douche IMMENSE ! A 2min du métro et 15min de Manhattan, idéal pour les journées intenses sur l'île de Manhattant et le calme de cette maison qui est sublime et dont le son vous transporte grâce aux musiques latines/jazzy ! On a eu l'occasion de partager la fameuse dinde de thanksgiving avec nos hotes, un moment inoubliable ! Je recommande ce logement si vous aimez le calme, le comfort et l'art. Cette maison est chaleureuse et pleine de découverte avec des objets d'artes, des peintures et de magnifique photo a découvrir dans toutes les pièces ! Encore merci Orestes pour ton accueil, nous reviendrons sans hésiter ![QWERTY123]It was amazing stay in Orestes's house. A peaceful and inspiring place. The area is safe and Manhattan is just a subway station away. Near the house you can find supermarkets, restaurants and more.The room is very clean, well decorated, spacious and the bathroom too.
Orestes helped us a lot with advices about places and location.
We felt very comfortable at his house and we totally recommend Orestes's house to all in Airbnb.
Hope return another time. Maybe in the spring!
And please, if you decide to come to Rio, please.. let us know!
Thanks for everything Orestes!
Amanda & Adriano[QWERTY123]After many guests we even had with AirBnB, that was our first time as a AirBnB guest ourselves - and it was a really great experience. The room and the house of Orestes are exactly as shown at the pics. It´s a great renovated townhouse, perfect located in Queens - Long Island City, just two metro-stations away from Times Square. 
In contrast to have the stay in Manhattan it is very quiet and relaxful there. The Metro is just 2 minutes to walk and after a few minutes more you are in midtown manhatten. Perfect!

The bedroom is very cozy and the own bathroom - with the biggest shower we´ve ever seen - is awesome and very clean too.

Orestes is a perfect host. He is very friendly, helpful and has many inside tips to get to know the ""Capital of the World"".

For every New York-Visitor we just can recommend Orestes and his great location and would love to come back. Thanks a lot and all the best![QWERTY123]Orestes’ place is very unique designed and decorated. His space is filled with the sense of art.Orestes is very knowledgeable and also warmhearted.Highly recommend!![QWERTY123]We loved staying at the Private Suite in Long Island City. The bedroom and bathroom were both nicely decorated, spacious and functional. I can imagine in Spring or Summer we would have relaxed and enjoyed the weather in the beautiful landscaped garden. It's just one stop from midtown Manhatten, so you do have all the advantages of being close to the city. We also enjoyed walking along the shore with the Manhattan Midtown skyline view and taking the ferry. We can certainly recommend Orestes' Private Suite![QWERTY123]We stayed at Orestes' place 4 nights at the end of March and we're very happy that we've chosen to stay with him. The location is ideal: a couple of minutes from the nearest Subway station (which takes you in a couple more minutes across the water) and very quiet. You also have a lot of space: large bedroom and a bathroom with a huge shower. Unfortunately, it was too cold to sit in the garden but it looked lovely from the outside!
Orestes himself was very friendly and always happy to help us out with suggestions or advice.
If you're happy with staying outside of the city center, I would definitely recommend Orestes' place![QWERTY123]Gorgeous house, lovely room, amazing shower, friendly host and very practical location! It's only one easy subway stop from manhattan and it's situated in a lovely neighborhood. As an added bonus, the Chrysler building pops up in the view down the street. We would definitely stay here again. Thank you, Orestes![QWERTY123]Our stay was great, the room is very nice, the shower is incredible, and the location is amazing : quiet, very close to Manhattan : different subway lines around the corner giving you very quick access to all of Manhattan, the view a few streets down is incredible : skyline at night a must see. Enough restaurants around the neighbourhood, to have a good choice, as well as quiet a few bars also.

For those on a budget there is a grocery store a quick walk away called the food cellar, you can eat pretty good hot food at a bargain.

Orestes is a very nice person helpful, quiet and kind.

I hope we will go back to New York one day with our children, it will be hard to find a place as good for the four of us.

To resume if you are looking for a place close to the action in a quiet area THIS IS THE PLACE!!!!!!!![QWERTY123]Notre séjour à New York a été rendu très agréable par l'accueil et le logement d'Orestes. L'habitation est très confortable et très accueillante au sein d'une maison aménagée avec beaucoup de charme. Orestes est quelqu'un de discret et disponible. C'est de plus très bien situé, tout proche d'une station de métro pour se rendre à Manhattan (une station plus loin) . Il y a des boutiques juste à coté , et un excellent ""Diner"" typique pour se restaurer.Nous en avons bien profité.
Nous recommandons vivement ce logement calme alors qu'il est si proche de Manhattan. Merci à Orestes.[QWERTY123]The bedroom and shower at Orestes'house is really clean, confortable and very nice! The house is only five minutes from the metro and it was very easy and fast to go to Manhattan. There are many restaurants around the house for breakfast, lunch and diner too. 
Orestes is very discreet, friendly and helpfull,  he has always good advises for where to go and see.
We really recommand his house for everyone who whants to come in New York and we hope we can come back one day to visit Orestes![QWERTY123]Orestes is a nice person and  a great host. He was helpful while he provided us privacy. We had a great conversations (workshops) which was very insightful.
The place was neat and comfortable, the garden just wonderful, a cafe there among the trees and beautiful flowers made us happy.
It is close to two metro stations with eating places and with subway Manhattan was really just couple of minutes.
All in all it was a excellent choice.
Thank you Orestes[QWERTY123]Our first trip to New York couldn't have been better. This was mainly due to the wonderfull place of Orestes. The facade of the building is really as lovely as on the picture, the bathroom even better. The bedroom offers enough space for all your stuff. Orestes helps you if you want. And if you'd prefer more privacy, that is also good. One of the best assets of this place is the location. Within a couple of stops you can get anywhere - from Manhattan to Brooklyn and Williamsburg. Stock up at one of the supermarkets close by and take the train to one of the best cities we've been to. An absolute recommendation![QWERTY123]The house is absolutely amazing, but the most amazing thing is how warm, nice and helpful were Orestes, Chris and Delilah. Highly recommended. We'd love to stay back with you, guys :) Thanks!!! Give some hugs to Kiki from us!!![QWERTY123]N'hésitez pas à séjourner chez Orestes. Sa maison est propre, calme et très joliment décorée. Elle est également bien située, à une station de métro de Manhattan. Nous avons également profité du jardin pour prendre notre petit déjeuner. Le soir, il est très agréable et reposant de manger dans le Queens en face des superbes grattes ciels éclairés. 
Corinne et Jeff[QWERTY123]Orestes was a very good host.  Very thoughtful and well organised.  Even though he wasn't around for 3/4 of our stay, he made sure everything was in place for us and made us feel at home.  He was also kind enough to share his dog Kiki, his study and workspace with us.  

The listing was as we expexted. The bedroom was spacious even though we had 3 pieces of luggage. The shower cubicle and bathroom was really nice and a good size.  

Orestes' s home is set in a pretty tree lined street.  It is in a very convenient location.  Going uptown or downtown in NYC was easily accessible by taxi or the subway.  The train lines no.7 or E and M pretty much covers access to most parts of NYC[QWERTY123]The stay was really great- a beautiful house right in the middle of Queens, close to two subway stations and great restaurants. We really enjoyed our stay there! The room and bathroom were also perfect and comfy.
Manhatten is reslly close as well.[QWERTY123]Für unseren ersten Besuch hätten wir keine bessere Unterkunft finden können. 
Pour notre premier séjour à NYC nous ne pouvions pas trouver de meilleur logement.
Das Haus hat Stil und ist liegt in einem ruhigen Viertel. Das Zimmer ist für 2 Personen komfortabel und ruhig, das Badezimmer sehr schön und modern mit sehr großer Dusche.
La maison à du style et se trouve dans un quartier tranquille. La chambre est pour 2 personnes confortable et tranquille, la salle de bain est belle et moderne avec une très grande douche.
Orestes ist sehr angenehm und freundlich, diskret aber immer bereit, jede Frage zu beantworten. Hat uns einen sehr guten Tipp fürs Abendessen in „seinem“ Viertel gegeben: LIC (Long Island City) Market. Sehr gute Küche, nette Atmosphäre, freundliche Leute.
Orestes est très agréable et gentil, discret mais toujours prêt à répondre à nos questions. Il nous a donné une bonne adresse dans son quartier pour le repas du soir à quelques pas de chez lui » LIC-Market » : très bonne cuisine, bonne atmosphère et  accueil chaleureux.
Mit der U-Bahn sind wenig Schritte vom Haus vom Haus entfernt und ein paar Stationen weiter ist man bereits in Manhattan. Wirklich ideal !
Avec le métro à quelques pas vous vous retrouver au cœur de Manhattan en quelques minutes. Vraiment idéal !
Als Gartenfreund möchte ich noch erwähnen, dass Orestes einen wunderschönen großen Garten im Hinterhof hat.
Je ne voudrai pas manquer de signaler le très beau jardin d’Orestes.
Vielen herzlichen Dank - Un grand merci - Thank you very much Orestes. 
Margit (D) / Patrick (F)
[QWERTY123]Le quartier est visiblement sûr  . La maison est superbe . Le jardin est immense pour un jardin en ville . La chambre est bien isolée du logement principal . Surface très confortable pour 2 personnes ( Mon fils 19 ans et moi même avions chacun un couchage de qualité ( y compris le convertible ) . Douche très grande . Placard , micro onde et petit réfrigérateur ; mais pas de possibilité de cuisiner .
Le métro passe à proximité --->  Arrêt Court Square à 2mn Ligne 7 pour Times Square et ligne  directe E pour prendre l'Air Train vers JFK (Website hidden by Airbnb)[QWERTY123]Mon séjour chez Orestes a été plus qu'agréable: la chambre est grande, avec un canapé, un petit frigo bien pratique, la salle de bain superbe avec une immense douche à l'italienne, le métro est à 3mn avec 4 lignes, un dinner, un petit supermarché, et autres pour déjeuner, dîner ou bruncher, un quartier calme à proximité de beaucoup de spots, la maison a un très beau design et un beau et grand jardin 
La proximité de l'East River est également un plus, en 5/10mn, vous êtes dans un ""park"" avec des bancs, chaises longues au bord de l'eau avec en vue le siège de l'Onu et une jolie skyline
Quand à Orestes, c'est vraiment un cœur, j'ai été malade (chaud/froid du métro et air conditionné) et il m'a préparé la recette spéciale de sa grand-mère, m'a fait de la soupe etc, vraiment agréable
Son ami et lui sont des personnes sympathiques, cultivées et intéressantes

A recommander sans hésitation, j'espère vite les revoir 

Translation ;)

My stay at Orestes home was more than pleasant: the room is big, with a sofa, a small and very practical refrigerator, a magnificent bathroom with an immense Italian-style shower, the subway is in 3mn with 4 lines, a dinner, a small supermarket, and other to have lunch, have dinner or have brunch, a calm borough near many spots, the house has also a very beautiful design and a beautiful and big garden
The closeness of East River is also one + there 5 / 10mn, you are in a ""park"" with benches, deckchairs at the water's edge with in sight of United Nations, and an attractive skyline
And Orestes, it is really a seweet heart, I was sick (warmly / cold of the subway and the air-conditioning) and he prepared to me the special recipe of his grandmother, made me some soup etc., really pleasant
Him and his partner are very nice, cultivated and interesting people

To recommend without hesitation, I hope to see them again, fast :)[QWERTY123]The reservation was canceled 33 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.[QWERTY123]Ottima accoglienza , Orestes persona squisita , camera bella pulita adatta ad ospitare due persone , zona perfetta (poche fermate dal centro caotico).
Consiglio a tutti di provare.[QWERTY123]I can honestly say this was to date my best Airbnb stay, and I've stayed in Airbnb properties around the world. Orestes honestly and accurately depicts his lovely space on the site, and his attention to detail ensures you'll have a comfortable experience. Spotlessly clean, convenient to transportation, safe, quiet, affordable, tastefully decorated. Plus a must-see-to-believe backyard paradise; you'll forget that you're in NYC. I'm almost hesitant to praise it too much more for fear that it will be so booked in the future that I may not be able to get in! Orestes is a kind, creative and welcoming host whose hospitality left me feeling like a friend more than a guest. I hope to return soon! ¡Muchisimas gracias Orestes![QWERTY123]He was there when we arrived, very helpful explained everything, great guy[QWERTY123]I greatly enjoyed staying in Orestes' home. The room and bathroom are spotless with many thoughtful touches, and the garden is wonderful. The neighborhood is safe and convenient. Orestes and his partner were very accommodating with check-in/check-out, making the whole process very easy.[QWERTY123]Orestes' home is a beautiful, quiet oasis with good dining nearby and a short 10-15 minute trip into the heart of Manhattan. His dog Kiki is a sweet ambassador for the place. I loved everything about this stay (except that it was too brief) and hope to return again.[QWERTY123]Orestes is a great host. His house is amazing, very well decorated and cozy. It has a wonderful shower, bad and garden. The location is also awsome, it is very close to the  subway station and one stop away from Manhatan. We certaintly recommend it![QWERTY123]Pros:
- Orestes is a great host, friendly & approachable, I asked to print some stuffs and he kindly let me use his printer. He even gave us postcards featuring his house as a souvenir.
- beautiful house with a lovely garden, conveniently located within minutes walk to the subway station, in a quiet neighborhood, with supermarket and cafes just round the corner.
- The private room that we stayed is very nicely decorated and has everything from a microwave, to a fridge with plates/cups/utensils all provided in the room, making it really convenient as you don't have to go all the way to the kitchen. Room is big & spacious, with a sofa, table & chairs. 
Cons:
- the exit of the subway station leading to the house only has stairs and no escalator/elevator. Hence if you have big/heavy luggages, it's quite a bit of work to carry them up & down. of course you can use other exits but they are further away.
-  the ""ensuite"" bathroom is not really adjoined to the bedroom, it is the next room beside the bedroom and you have to walk down the hallway to get to it. of course it is still privately yours and is a really cool bathroom equipped with different shower heads.
- Unlike some hosts who left keys for you in some secret place so that you can let yourself into the house anytime you arrive, Orestes does not do that and we waited a while for him out in the cold when we arrived close to midnight. of course I communicated my arrival time to him but he was out having dinner and missed the timing. well, I guess this is all part & parcel of the little hiccups of travelling.[QWERTY123]Somos el Pere y la Núria hemos estado unos días en casa de Orestes agracerle primero su amabilidad y recomendar a cualquier persona que quiera una estancia en New York ir a su casa. Esta es preciosa muy bien (Website hidden by Airbnb) sensación es  estar en una zona residencial a dos paradas de metro de Manhattan. Nos queda un muy buen recuerdo de dicha estancia no dudamos si volviesemos ir a su casa nuevamente .[QWERTY123]I stayed at Orestes' lovely place for 4 nights. It was great- conveniently located, clean, comfortable. Bathroom was particularly nice. House dog, Kiki, was sweet. Orestes was easy to communicate with and lovely in person. Overall, a great place to stay.[QWERTY123]This was certainly a wonderful place to stay, and the definition of what Airbnb is about. An affordable way of staying in an exciting city, in lovely accommodation that is very close to transport and good restaurants. The hospitality made me feel very much at home, and so  although I was traveling on business, it made the trip feel like a vacation! Many thanks.[QWERTY123]Our host made us feel completely at home with a warm friendly welcome and everything described in the listing was accurate, clean linen, brochures for sight seeing was a very big help for the first time in the area visitor. I must admit the shower was to die for, not only for the visual but for what it delivers. I can not fault this listing in any way. I would highly recommend where this listing is located with 2 train stations within a very short walk to either. We will use this listing in the future. Well done Orestes.[QWERTY123]Orestes was a great host!
We stayed at his beautiful home for 4 nights and enjoyed it very much. The Location is perfectly located (very close to the subway) and absolutly tidy and clean. We loved the wonderful shower and the bathroom most. I would always recommend staying at this place.
[QWERTY123]Orestes is a terrific host, warm and very knowledgeable about the area. He also has a wonderful design sense, and we really enjoyed his place. The dog is great, too. We felt completely at home and also loved the museums and restaurants in the neighborhood. The location is also fantastic for traveling to Manhattan. We felt we had privacy and freedom to come and go, but also that Orestes was always available for questions or advice.[QWERTY123]Orestes is a great host.[QWERTY123]We had a great stay at Orestes house! Location is perfect in a nice quit street and in just 5 minutes you're in the centre of Manhattan.
Orestes is really helpful if you want tips ore advise for your city planning.
I would recoment this place to everyone I know.[QWERTY123]Orestes is a very nice guy and a good host. His apartment is well located (near the subway, but you do not hear it), clean and good looking.[QWERTY123]De buurt was okay en de foto's geven een goed beeld van de werkelijke situatie.
De kamer en de badkamer waren schoon.
De ontvangst was vriendelijk en de gastheer verleende de gevraagde hulp.

[QWERTY123]Thanks Orestes for being a very kind host. The place is nice as described and clean and the location is perfect to get to manhatten in one or two subway Station. We enjoyed the morning run to the riverview because we could start our day with a great view. 
Orestes is very helpful and and has recommendations when needed.
Kiki is a quiet cute lovely old lady (his dog) :) I think she only barked once in two weeks and that was a hello bark :)
Thanks Orestes and greetings from Germany[QWERTY123]Orestes's place in Long Island City is really a gem.  It is well situated, on a lovely street and just 1 block from the subway, so you are close to Manhattan without actually being in Manhattan.
The room is spacious, with everything I needed (and more), and the bathroom is luxurious and beautifully designed.  The back garden is a green oasis and was so pleasant to sit in after a long day.
Orestes was a gracious host, meeting me late on the first night and even buying some essentials to put in the fridge for me.  He was friendly, warm and helpful without being intrusive.  
Many reasons that I will go back to Orestes' place again![QWERTY123]This place is a gem in the artist community of Long Island City!  Thank you, Orestes, for making our stay a truly memorable one![QWERTY123]yes Orestes was very pleasant , the room was most comfortable with the AC being very welcome. The bathroom was spacious with a lovely shower. 
The neighbourhood is great with many restaurants and shops around. Nice location to the East River beautiful vistas and access to Brooklyn and Manhatten by ferry .  easy to get to the two Metro stations.[QWERTY123]Nous avons passé une très agréable séjour chez Orestes. La chambre est spacieuse et bien équipée. De plus cet hébergement est situé dans un quartier très calme et très bien situé : à quelques minutes de Manhattan, à deux pas de plusieurs lignes de métro (E, M, G, 7) desservant directement les principaux sites touristiques de Manhattan (E, M, 7), l'aéroport JFK (E) et à proximité d'un supermarché et d'un dinner typique.
L'accueil d'Orestes était très agréable et nous recommandons donc cet hébergement sans hésitation.[QWERTY123]Really nice place and in a great location. We were booked to be in a room on the basement level but for our first night we stayed upstairs as the previous guests had to stay another night. That was fine with us, the upstairs room was a good size, comfy bed and a huge shower in the bathroom. The next day we did move to our downstairs room and just as nice. Good sized, comfortable bed, TV in the room, a sofa and a small fridge. Bathroom was awesome. Large shower area. 

This airbnb is less than 5 minutes to a subway stop that takes you right into Manhattan. Also just as close to a grocery store and several restaurants many of which are the fine dining type. 

Orestes left for the weekend we were there but Christian was there and was very helpful and accommodating. We loved their dog Kiki. Very friendly and quiet. We would definitely go back to this airbnb.[QWERTY123]An very nice place with an very spacius bathroom. The shower was very interesting.  
It´s very clean and the connection to manhattan was very good.
Orestes is an very kind host and very helpful. 
It was very nice to use the garden for our morning coffee and  breakfast.
We had a great stay here for 6 nights.
I would recommend this place for everyone.  
Orestes thanks for your help. 
I think it´s not our last time here :-)[QWERTY123]Orestes a été accueillant et sympathique. La chambre était parfaite et la salle de bain privative est un plus . Nous nous sommes sentis comme chez nous. Le logement est très bien situé: métro, restaurants et supermarché sont à 2 pas. Nous recommandons sans hésiter la chambre d'Orestes![QWERTY123]We thoroughly enjoyed our stay here! The street and the house were absolutely beautiful, just like in the photos! Orestes was there to greet us when we arrived, and gave us a short tour of the place. He was very helpful in providing advice on things to do, and was very easy to chat to, but also gave you the right amount of space. The bedroom was very spacious, and we absolutely loved having breakfast outside in the garden every morning. We bought supplies to make breakfasts and lunches. There were no formal cooking facilities, but we didn't expect there to be and we definitely didn't need them - the bar fridge, microwave and kettle in our room were more than enough for us. We just washed our dishes in the bathroom. The bathroom was lovely! We had use of a guest computer and printer, which was really handy for sorting through photos and printing out tickets, etc. Orestes had to fly out half way through our stay, but Gabriella stayed to house-sit, and she was just as friendly and great to chat with! We loved Orestes' dog, Kiki, as well. It was a great base to come back to after a full day of exploring - it was quiet, safe and extremely close to the subway. There was also a diner round the corner that provided a quick and cheap dinner when needed. Overall, Orestes was a great host, the neighbourhood was perfect, and the house itself was beautiful - we would definitely stay here again.[QWERTY123]We really liked staying at Oresres' place, it's clean, comfortable and very cosy. The room is spacious and has all what you need including a few extras like a mini fridge, a microwave and a filter coffee machine. The bathroom is superb, very nicely designed and the shower is something to look forward to after a long hot New York day. The apartment also features a great outdoors terrace that Orestes is kind enough to allow access, and while he wasn't around during our stay, our host Gabriela was very welcoming and made sure our stay was comfortable and allowed for our privacy.

The location is excellent, only one stop away from Manhattan with the subway station around the block. The area itself boasts a number of attractions and a few good restaurants.

This will definitely be our preferred place to stay whenever we visit NYC.[QWERTY123]Orestes' Unterkunft war super! Besser hätten wir es in NYC nicht treffen können!
Das Zimmer war sauber, groß und hatte Extras wie einen kleinen Kühlschrank und eine Mikrowelle! Noch besser als das Schlafzimmer war das Bad! Alles sehr sauber, einfach zum Wohlfühlen! 
Der Garten hinter Orestes Haus war toll, um zu frühstücken oder einfach nur zu sitzen und die Stille zu genießen!
Die Lage der Unterkunft ist sehr zentral, nur wenige Schritten von der nächsten Subway entfernt! Diner und Supermarkt sind ebenfalls um die Ecke! 
Da Orestes in der Zeit, in der wir gebucht hatten, nicht zuhause war, empfing uns Gaby, die Housekeeperin! Gaby war wunderbar! Sie hat uns freundlichst empfangen, uns die Räume gezeigt und uns ein paar Insider Tips gegeben. Danke nochmal Gaby :))

Wir würden auf jeden Fall wieder kommen![QWERTY123]Great location close to sculpture centre and moma/ps1 restaurants and the gorgeous waterfront overlooking Manhattan which is only one subway stop away. Quiet room in a lovely brownstone street and an architect designed shower I could live with forever. My family of  four fitted and our host was a pleasure. We love the local diner but all kinds of dining a stroll away.  Long Island City is a great location from which to enjoy New York.[QWERTY123]Overall , it was an amazing experience , being first time in New York with my daughter.  The hosts , Oreste and Gabriela did all they could, so we really felt at home and safe. The description of the house was exactly as in the web site... the room was spacious, very clean and also the bathroom was itself  a dream. Very quiet area, and do not forget the private garden, a beautiful spot to drink your coffee.  Strongly recommended.  Definitely the place to return on our next trip to New York. Thanks , Carmen & Oana
[QWERTY123]A great place, a haven of peace, very well situated, quiet but yet two stops from the main attractions in Midtown Manhattan. You can hardly imagine the fantastic garden in the back, whre we could relax at night after the hustle and bustle in the big city. We didn't meet Orestes - wich was sad - but his very nice friend Gabriela looked after us and N.Y. without her would only has been half as good.

Gudrun & Michael, Germany[QWERTY123]My wife and I spent 5 days recently at Orestes place and thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The temperatures in New York were in the 90's the whole time, so the air condition suite was really appreciated.  Orestes was a very helpful and accommodating host and helped us out with our daily touring/planning.  The bedroom unit has all the amenities one would need, assuming you are there to see New York, and not simply stay in the bedroom. The location of this residence is so perfect, on a quite tree lined street, but yet a few minutes walk to the major subway lines, restaurants, convenience stores, and water front.  I am a Landscape Architect and Oreste has done a wonderful job with his rear yard/garden oasis, and it was so nice to sit in the heavily landscape yard in the morning, and one would never know they were so close to Manhattan.  We would certainly look at booking with Orestes next time we need accommodation in New York.[QWERTY123]Orestes was a great host. He was helpful with any questions and recommendations. The home is exactly as described. Beautiful, clean, and extremely convenient to the City. Only one stop away! I fully recommend his place for a NY visit, and will be staying there again on my next visit![QWERTY123]A few days @ Home and i want to go back again already.  Back to NY, but also back to Orestes!! A perfectly furnished apartment, cozy and warm. The apartment is suberbly located richt next to the metrostation which takes you in no time in the center of Manhattan. 
Orestes knots mand Nice spots in NY city and tells you About iT if you want. IT was our first time we have booked trough Airbnb, a fantastic experience also by the enthusiasm by Orestes, huis partner an not to mention the sweet old lady Kiki (sweet dog)! Privacy in this apartment guaranteed!!!

NY is one of the best things ever happened to me. I hope to come back to NY and ofcourse with Orestes[QWERTY123]Staying here was a wonderful experience, not only is the place better than in the pictures and perfectly located, but Orestes was an amazing host, extremely nice and made us feel at home. Would definitely recommend staying here if you can, you will not regret it.[QWERTY123]Orestes took great care of my mom and sister. They really enjoyed their stay, and were very grateful for all the hospitality and suggestions that Orestes provided. Would definitely recommend![QWERTY123]We so enjoyed our stay at Orestes lovely home.  The bedroom was spacious and very comfortable and included a TV, mini fridge, microwave and coffee machine.  Orestes' garden was an oasis where we could sit and enjoy our breakfast before setting out for the day.  
The location is excellent for access to the subway with trains taking us all the way into Manhatten.
Orestes is a  gracious host, and made us feel very welcome. 
If we should ever return to New York, we would definitely book with Orestes.[QWERTY123]We just wish we could have stayed longer.  Orestes has done an amazing job of rehabilitating an historic row house and it was so great as a guest to get to feel part of the neighborhood for a brief stay. Access to the subway is from all directions, a block or less away. It was so nice to come back to the quiet green street after being in the hubbub of Manhattan.  Hope to be back there next year or sooner![QWERTY123]Orestes and Cristian were great hosts, they made sure we had everything we need for a pleasant stay. 

The place is great. Excellent location, really near the subway, safe neighborhood and a lot of facilities near the house.

I hope I can come back some day.[QWERTY123]This was the second time I've stayed at Orestes' place and once again it was absolutely great. The house is beautifully decorated and just one block away from 3 major subway lines. Our room was spotless. There are great little cafes and restaurants in walking distance, too. Orestes is a wonderful host, always very welcoming and helpful. It felt like staying with a friend. I can only highly recommend his place.[QWERTY123]Great place to stay on the outskirts of the city. Away from the crazy hubbub of Manhatten but close enough to be handy to everywhere. Interesting and lovely people, a really special house and very knowledgeable host![QWERTY123]Me and my sister had a great trip to NYC and enjoyed staying in Orestes wonderful suite. Its in a nice and very quiet neighbourhood, and very close to the subway. In 7 minutes we were standing at Manhattan.
Orestes is a great host. Kind and with good suggestions for dining out in the local neighbourhood. We will definately come back to stay at Orestes place :-)[QWERTY123]My mom and I stayed 1 week at Orestes´ place and we loved it! Orestes is a great host - he gives you your privacy, but is always there to answer any question you may have.
The room is very nice and cozy. Comfortable beds!
The neighborhood felt save and only a short walk from the water where I went running alone in the morning. It is so much more quit than down-/uptown New York which we really appreciated. 
There is a lot of nice places to eat and the supermarked is right around the corner.
The metro/train is only 5 minutes away and runs all the time.

I/we have only positive things to say about Orestes and his place, and I/we highly recommend other people to stay there if they want to visit New York City. 
If I/we am/are going to New York again, I/we hope that Orestes has room for us :)
[QWERTY123]Amazing place, excelent location , and perfect owner . What else to say but a place that will boost you NYC experience!!!! Hghly recommended !!![QWERTY123]Orestes is a lovely gentleman, a wonderful neighbor and a vibrant businessman and artist. All of these components make him the perfect host for AirBnB. He is welcoming with genuine warmth and full details about the private room he rents and also the neighborhood, and he goes above and beyond in terms of taking care of his guests.[QWERTY123]Orestes was very welcoming and helpful.  I neglected to let him know that we were arriving later than he expected.  He had to go out, but he left a key in a convenient location and made sure we had no difficulties getting in.  The bedroom is comfortable and location is indeed convenient.  For those addicted to connectivity, the wifi is a bit intermittent.[QWERTY123]Orestes and Chris were very welcoming; their artwork adds to the ambiance. While it was too cool to use the garden, this would be ideal in the summer. The room is quite comfortable and quiet, in a very convenient location, with good restaurants nearby. The wifi worked fine. We would definitely stay there again.[QWERTY123]Orestes was a great host: he kept in contact and gave loads of fantastic tips for food and stuff to do. We loved the ferry ride he recommended from Gantry Plaza Park - what a great way to get to Manhattan! 

The house and neighborhood are lovely. Long Island City has loads of great restaurants and cafes, and we especially enjoyed brunch at LIC Market (another recommendation from Orestes!). The house is minutes from the metro, and from there it is super easy to get to Manhattan (one stop to Mid Town). An ideal location, really. 

[QWERTY123]Our stay in Oreste's house was a perfekt experience ! It was very comfortable, clean and very quiet (we could sleep with our window open in the center of NY and be woken up by the birds in the morning !)
It's very close from two subways main lines. It's very convenient after a long day in the city.
There are many places to eat in the neighborhood with a variety of food from all over the world.
Oreste is a very nice guy, he took time to explain us how the best way to walk around in the city and the good places to go. Unfortunately, he had to travel and we didn't see him again. But his companion Christian was there and he was as kind as Oreste. He was always ready to answer when we had a question.
We lowe this place and hope we could come again. We sincerely recommend this house if you like comfort and a nice place !
Thanks you so much Oreste and Christian for your nice and kind welcome !
Sylvie and Francine, Geneva[QWERTY123]This was our first Airbnb experience and Orestes and Chris made it an extremely positive and memorable trip! They were easy to work with on both check-in and check-out times, even when our flight in ended up being delayed several hours. Everything matched the online description and the location couldn't have been more convenient for travel on the Subway system into Manhattan. Orestes was very helpful when it came to questions about transportation and the city itself. We highly recommend staying here on your next visit to NYC![QWERTY123]Wonderful stay. Great hosts and amazing location. Very practical with the E and 7 lines. Quiet area, birds chirping in the morning, nice room and bathroom, exactly as describe in the listing. Highly recommended.[QWERTY123]The location was great, safe and close to 2 subway stations. We had difficulty contacting our host pre visit which we found very distressing but realised afterwards that he had some emergency.  The shower is wonderful but be aware that it is not ensuite! I would definitely recommend this property.[QWERTY123]What an amazing place to stay! A nice and cozy private room, a terrific bathroom, beautiful artwork! But what counts even more is the host’s warmth and welcoming nature. Highly recommendable, I’ld definitely stay there again![QWERTY123]Wir fühlten uns in unserer Unterkunft sehr gut aufgehoben. Orestes war ein aufmerksamer Gastgeber, ohne aufdringlich zu sein. Das originelle, gut gepflegte  Haus liegt in einer ruhigen Gegend. U-Bahnstationen der Linien E und 7 liegen ein paar Schritte entfernt und man ist in 1 Station mitten in Manhatten. Das Zimmer ist zweckmässig eingerichtet. Wir durften unser Frühstück in dem wunderbaren romantischen Garten einnehmen. Ein Highlight!
Kurz zusammengefasst: Die Unterkunft können wir wärmstens empfehlen und würden bei einem nächsten Aufenhalt in NY sofort wieder dort buchen.[QWERTY123]Thank you so much for the wonderful hospitality, Orestes... our stay couldn't have been made better! Our room was very comfortable, quiet and very private. We loved having breakfast in your lovely garden oasis. We got to really appreciate the neighbourhood and easy access to the subway system. I would gladly return! :-)[QWERTY123]Fantastic stay! The location as perfect, very close the the subway. The property itself was lovely, we specially liked the bathroom, very spacious. Orestes is a lovely host, he was always there if we needed any help at the same time maintaining our privacy. If we visit NY again, we will definitely stay here.[QWERTY123]Great place, amazingly located, kind host.[QWERTY123]Orestes, Thanks for being our consummate host ! 
Allister, Brandon (our 20mth old) and I stayed with Orestes at his gorgeous townhome on a quaint tree lined street.  We come to NY often but this was the first time we decided not to stay at a boring hotel in Manhattan and we're so glad we picked to stay at Orestes!  The place is just lovely, and the neighbour (that we met) was great.  Very secure home and in a safe neighborhood if you are worried or new to the Airbnb experience.  Orestes had great recommendations if you want to explore Queens or head into Manhattan.  The home is as described but better, you have full privacy in the spacious room and large bathroom, clean, and very convenient access on the E and 7 lines (only a 2-3 minute walk).  Besides the art and decor of the place, the other highlight is the beautiful garden in the back of the home.  A garden paradise away from the hustle and bustle of the city, we loved kicking back and enjoying our breakfast in the garden.   If you share a love of photography, art and travel/culture, you will enjoy your stay with Orestes’s as we have.  Definitely would love to stay at Orestes’s again, and would recommend to our friends and other Airbnb members.[QWERTY123]The host canceled this reservation 24 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.[QWERTY123]Orestes es encantador  y su casa muy acogedora. Nuestra estancia fue muy agradable y tranquila. Recomendo la experiencia. Gracias Orestes.[QWERTY123]Nice room in a beatiful house! It is a quiet, safe neighbourhood, with restaurants and shops nearby. Manhattan can be reached in minutes using the Metro. Two stations are located close by. Orestes and Cristian are perfect hosts, being there when you need them yet still allowing for privacy. We were allowed to use the washer/dryer and besides the intermittent wifi-connection, everything was fine. Kiki is a delight for every dog lover and for early risers the garden is an oasis of peace. Thank you very much![QWERTY123]We enjoyed the stay a lot. Orestes and Chris are really nice guys and help with info wherever they can. Several train and metrolines are just around the corner so it is very easy to go to manhattan or to discover queens, williamsburgh, brooklyn ..... The house is perfectly renovated and the room with seperate bathroom is perfect for recovering from intense city tours. Around the corner are restaurants and bars but you have to know a bit where to look for it ( try court sqare diner, john brown bbq, also a nice thai at court square)[QWERTY123]Orestes was welcoming and a good host.  We were very grateful for the phone calls that he made on our behalf to sort out some coach tickets and he suggested places of interest to visit. 

The room is large and comfortable with a microwave and cups for that all-important cup of home-made tea or coffee. The bathroom is next door to the bedroom and the shower lived up to the expectations that we had read about in previous reviews!

This is a great location, very close to the subway and only a few stops from the heart of Manhattan. The neighbourhood feels like a safe, quiet residential area with a good selection of cafes and diners which are cheaper than the city centre. This was a secure and friendly base from which we enjoyed a great time in New York. 

Thank you, Orestes!
[QWERTY123]The host canceled this reservation 158 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.[QWERTY123]The host canceled this reservation 2 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.[QWERTY123]The location is pretty good, its close to the train station and there are several restaurants and grocery stores nearby. Orestes is a very nice person! Highly recommend![QWERTY123]A great place to stay in NYC. Orestes is a brilliant host with a fabulous apartment. The room and bathroom are spacious, clean and decorated to a very high standard.  Orestes has loads of local knowledge and was a great help to us. The apartment is in a fantastic location. The metro is a 5 min walk and we felt very safe. You can also get a really good view of Manhattan from GantryPlaza which is only 20 mins away on foot. Here you can also get a boat down the river. Another great tip from Orestes. 

Thank you Orestes! Hopefully be back in NYC in the future![QWERTY123]Orestes was very friendly, communicative, and gracious before and during our stay. Upon arrival, he gave us a nice quick tour and we got to meet Kiki the lovely dog. His place was very clean and quaint, just as described. His backyard was especially beautiful - too bad we did not get to utilize it since we were out exploring most of the days. In fact the entire block is just beautiful to walk down.

Overall our stay with Orestes was very pleasant. We'd stay here again if we visited.[QWERTY123]You're paying for location. The place is very nice but if you're in the city exploring you will not care so much about how nice the place is.  If you plan to have any guests at all this is not the place.  For not that much more you can get a hotel in the city which could be a better option for you depending on your needs.  

But Queens is an amazing place and a very nice place to stay.  We were able to walk to all kinds of food, bars, and the beautiful park on the water where you can see the whole city skyline.  The ""private entrance, private room, dedicated bathroom"" are all right outside of the hosts home office which he will be in constantly, which is fine but the wording of his description put a larger emphasis on privacy so I guess expected more.

Over all, this place is very nice but if I had to do it again I would strongly consider going to a hotel for a little more per day or gone to a cheaper Airbnb.
[QWERTY123]The journey is very happy! Orestes""s home is very comfortable and clean. There have M/E/7 line subway to Manhattan, It takes only one stop and ten minutes .Nearby supermarket and restaurant is available .We love it and hope to live next time![QWERTY123]We had a great time in NYC and in Orestes house! The location in LIC was perfect and very close with the subway to Brooklyn and Manhattan  (1 stop!). We also liked the neighborhood and the beautiful historic house. The room was clean and spacious, the bed comfortabel. Above of all there is a beautiful garden where we had our own breakfast every morning. Thank you Orestes for all the good care![QWERTY123]Orestes & Chris were fantastic hosts. The accommodation was exactly as described - even before arrival Orestes was extremely responsive in replying to any queries we had. The location was great - close to the subway and only 2/3 stops from Manhattan, but far enough away from the city to get away from it all. We had an absolutely brilliant time and would definitely book this accommodation again if or when we decide to return to New York! Thanks for everything :)[QWERTY123]We had a wonderful time in NYC and at Oreste's house. It is perfect if you want to be close to Manhattan (just 1-3 stops with the metro). The neighbourhood LIC is very nice and safe with metro stations just around the corner. The room and bathroom are spacious, clean and comfortable and Oreste is a great host with a Sweet dog. We really enjoyed our stay![QWERTY123]Great location and room. Orestes was a very friendly and good host. I would come back again.[QWERTY123]Orestes es un gran anfitrión, no sólo preocupado de que el alojamiento fuera perfecto, si no que también tuvo la amabilidad de compartir algunos consejos geniales sobre la ciudad, lo que hizo nuestra estadía aún mejor. El alojamiento es exactamente como se muestra en la descripción, y aún mejor, espacioso y luminoso y con un jardín de sueños. Lo pasamos de maravilla junto a mi marido. Lo amamos y esperamos volver pronto![QWERTY123]Perfecto.Ideal. No está en Manhattan, pero en 3 paradas cortas de metro estas en el Estación Central[QWERTY123]Orestes was very prompt in replying to all questions and requests.  He gave great suggestions of places to see.  The location is very close to MTA station - very convenient.  The bathroom and towels were cleaned daily, which was very nice.[QWERTY123]Beautiful home, nice sized bedroom and private bathroom with a lovely large shower. Located on a very scenic street and conveniently close to transport which takes you straight to Manhattan in a matter of minutes. Orestes is a very friendly and helpful host - highly recommend for a fantastic stay in the Big Apple![QWERTY123]We love this place. This was our second stay at Orestes'. The first time I was alone with my oldest (11y), this second visit with my wife and our 2 kids (9 & 11y). It is very quiet, at the same time very close to everything wih the 2 subway lines at just 1 block away. There is also a super convenient dinner at the corner. The room is cozy, the bathroom is superb. Exactly as pictured. Orestes and Christian are great guests![QWERTY123]Orestes was an absolutely fantastic host. The room was extremely clean and comfortable during the cold weather. He was very friendly and was always available for tips or suggestions for the city. The location is perfect. Do not confuse Long Island City with Long Island. It is only one subway stop to Manhatten and it takes about a 10 minute ride to Time Square or Grand Central. Highly recommended Orestes for any type of stay.[QWERTY123]Thank you for a great stay! We look forward to coming back! We would love the tv to be working next time, but everything else was great! This is a great place and very accurate description![QWERTY123]Orestes' house is an absolute gem! The room is quiet, clean, large and comfortable, and Orestes and Christian made me feel very welcome in their stunning home. The back yard is an oasis of tranquility in frenetic New York.

Long Island City is just one stop from Manhattan on the subway, and is very easy to get to from JFK and La Guardia, and has excellent transport links to Queens, Manhattan and Brooklyn.

Highly recommended![QWERTY123]This is my 3rd times at Orestes'. It is my favorite place to stay when I visit NYC. I feel always welcome. Cris and Orestes are great hosts. The proximity of the train lines around the house makes it easy to go around the city. I highly recommend it.[QWERTY123]As others have noted, walkable and comfortable. Recommended![QWERTY123]Everything is comfortable,when I lived in Orestes's house. Specaily,I really enjoyed the bathroom that Mr.Orestes provide us. It is really clean and nice. The location is very
convenience. My friend and I really like it![QWERTY123]This place is the perfect location for someone looking to explore queens as well as travel into the city during their trip. The block is historic and picturesque, so close to lots of different subway lines and the room itself is very clean and comfortable! Would highly suggest this place.[QWERTY123]Spotless accommodation in a up-and-coming part of the city with super easy access to public transit and tourist destinations in Manhattan. The hosts were fantastic.[QWERTY123]Orestes is the perfect host: around when needed and not around when privacy was needed. The best shower I have ever had. Beautiful artsy environment that was intriguing and gorgeous. Easy access to major subway lines with neighborhood food options.  Lovely time.[QWERTY123]What a great find, brilliant location, 1 stop your in Manhattan. a lovely room, spotlessly clean, fantastic shower in such a stylish home. Fan, aircon, firidge everything you need for your stay.

Orestes was very welcoming, helpful and I hope we are able to stay again.[QWERTY123]La maison d'Orestes est très bien placée entre 2 stations de métro (E/M et 7/G) et très bien décorée ! On sent la patte de l'architecte. Orestes est un hôte très sympa qui connait bien la ville et a plein de bons plans. Très facile d'accès depuis JFK et très rapide pour se rendre à Manhattan (2 stations très proches à 2min). Orestes is a very nice host, very kind. His house and the room is awesome for a couple, with a nice little garden. Location is great, easy acces from JFK, easy to go to Manhattan or Brooklynn by subway (very close to 2 metro stations). We will love to come back next time ![QWERTY123]Que dire sur la maison d’Orestes et de Cristian qui n’ait  pas déjà été  dit. 
Nous revenons ravis de notre séjour à Long Island City à 5 minutes de Manhattan.
Tout nous a séduit :

La maison se situe dans une rue type West Village mais en mieux, puisque nous avons été surpris en arrivant d’entendre chanter les oiseaux dans les arbres. Avons succombé au charme du jardin d’Orestes. Maison aménagée avec goût, très inspirante.
La situation extrêmement près du métro lignes (E/M) ou (7/G). on peut facilement aller à l’aéroport mais aussi en plein Manhattan plus vite que si on y était ! 
La vue sur Manhattan superbe le long de la East River. Bateau one stop to Manhattan et possibilité de joindre le Williamsburg et wall street aussi
Les bons restaurant alentours (Bia, LIC Market, Court square ouvert 24H/24) 
Le quartier riche en musées contemporains et street art (près des studios de cinéma)

Mais surtout l’accueil et la personnalité de notre hôte Orestes. En effet sa gentillesse, disponibilité  a fait de ce séjour un moment unique. Nous avons pu notamment partager notre  passion pour le jardin et l’art. Bref tout était parfait !

Thanks again Orestes for receiving us. We look forward to seeing you again.
[QWERTY123]Fantastic space to stay in. Orestes made us feel very welcome. The listing is absolutely perfect for getting anywhere in Manhattan. There is a Metro station right around the corner. Very convenient.

The neighborhood was also quiet and felt safe. Thank you for hosting us![QWERTY123]We had a fantastic stay at Orestes and Christian’s house. They are amazing.
And Orestes description (and pictures) of the room, the house, the area and the direction from JFK was exactly right.
They were both very helpful with hints on restaurants, sightseeing etc.
Thank you for opening your home to us – hope you will let us come back. All the best to you and Kiki.[QWERTY123]Orestes' place in LIC is very well located and charming. The room is very big and the bathroom is newly renovated. The private entrance into their home makes it easy access in and out. We definitely recommend it![QWERTY123]Great hosts and a wonderfull placefrom which to explore the City. Close to Metro and in no-time in Manhattan. I would reccomend it highly to friends and family.[QWERTY123]We spent 4 amazing in NYC and we really appreciated the Orestes house. Beautiful and typical house. The little garden is lovely and very useful for an outdoor breakfast (except some hungry mosquitos...). The position of this B&B is quite perfect (2 min from the subway Line E so 5 min from Manhattan) and finally Orestes is a very sympatical host, always available. Thanks, hope to come back again.[QWERTY123]We looooove staying at Orestes', this is our second time and it was just as great as the first but with the bonus that we already knew Orestes was an amazing host so it was all easy peasy. Room is just as pictured, huge, clean, bathroom is amazing and you can't beat the location. 

Hope you are well Orestes, Juan says hi and we'll see you again soon![QWERTY123]As advertised.  Lovely street.  Subway access to Manhattan is excellent.  We really only slept there which it was perfect suited for.  Accommodating and friendly hosts.  Thanks![QWERTY123]Great location and wonderful hosts!! We loved our stay here.[QWERTY123]My first trip to NYC was fantastic!! My son and I were so blessed by our gracious hosts!!! Thank you both so much for your kindness...we are so grateful!!![QWERTY123]Excelente ubicación de la casa, la atención de Orestes es excelente y hay un buen jardin disponible para los huespedes. Transporte publico a solo 1 cuadra. En fin muy recomendable.[QWERTY123]Orestes's place was great, the best we've been to so far. 

It's just like the pictures: pretty, spacious and clean. He made us feel at home right away and gave us some good tips to eat and go to. If you need him, he's always available.

The location is great as well. The subway is literately around the corner and not far from Manhattan.

We really recommend this place![QWERTY123]We really loved our stay at Orestes's. The bedroom and the bathroom were both really large and confortable. The house was very tastefully decorated, and really close to the subway. Orestes is very welcoming and kindly answered to all our questions. We will definitely come back! Thank you![QWERTY123]Orestes was an excellent host. The room was large and comfortable, the bathroom was lovely and everything was clean. 

The location was fantastic, it was so quick and easy to get everywhere we wanted to on the subway which is right around the corner. 

We had a great stay and would definitely recommend staying here.[QWERTY123]The house is just few stops out of Manhattan, in a residential area, with the chance to take several subway lines to reach different points of the city easily. The room is comfortable, as the bathroom too: it would have been great to have the access to the bathroom straight from the bedroom, because you need to walk through the entrance to the working studio, but Orestes has been always very nice and left us our privacy and spaces. He is a great host, very precise and available to give tips and indications. Next to the house there is a supermarket, an American diner, Coffee shops, there is everything you could need during a vacation.  
It's a good solution for people visiting NYC and not spending lot of time inside the house and for who likes to live more as a resident than as a tourist.[QWERTY123]We had six fantastic days in Orestes charming house and with Orestes as the perfect host. 
Nice, friendly, many good advices, as walking tours, what to see, where to eat etc. Nice to stay in a part of NY, where people lives. In addition, easy to take the subway to Manhattan, being in the center of this interesting town – and nice to come back in the evenings in a quiet atmosphere.
Al the best recommendations to the place, and Orestes!
Henrik and Rikke, august 2017[QWERTY123]We had very comfortable and convenient stay!! Thank you so much![QWERTY123]Great location, so close to Manhattan. Room is spacious and very comfortable. The shower is phenomenal - multiple heads and a steam function. Cris was lovely and very helpful. We highly recommend Orestes' home and would return.[QWERTY123]This places is amazing, located in a very convenient and safe area. The hosts are very friendly and always willing to help![QWERTY123]We stayed for three nights. As first time travelers to NYC, we wanted to be close to or in Manhattan. We chose this property because it was close to the city but allowed us to escape the hustle and bustle. The property is only a minute walk from Courts Square metro and the subway goes directly into Manhattan. 15 minutes and you're in Times Square. It is quick, cheap (about $2.50 one-way) and convenient. An Uber or taxi from Downtown is about $30. The neighborhood itself is quintessential gritty Queens but did not appear dangerous and the street itself is beautiful and quite. 
The room exceeded our expectations. We thought it would be a small space, but it was the size of a standard hotel room. It was clean. It has a mini fridge, microwave, couch, double bed and air conditioning. The bed was soft and the room was quiet. The bathroom was fantastic. A proper bathroom with big shower, plenty of hot water - plus a sauna feature. 
Both Orestes and Cris were wonderful hosts. They were accommodating to our requests and were very welcoming with their home. They lived upstairs, allowing for privacy as well as access to free wifi and most of the whole bottom floor. We were also offered full use of the courtyard at the back, which would be perfect for breakfast in the sunshine or to read a book. 
This place is a definite gem and we would highly recommend staying here again.  Thank you again, Orestes and Cris for your kind hospitality.[QWERTY123]Merci à Orestes et Christian pour leurs explications, précisions et propositions de visites, notamment une entre Le Queen's et Brooklyn fort sympathique!
Ils sont disponibles et très accueillants. 
Le calme de la maison est salutaire après les journées de visites entre-autres dans la fougue de Manhattan!
Nous avons pu profiter du joli jardin pour les petits-déjeuner et ce fut bien agréable! La maison est très jolie et rapide d'accès pour Manhattan! On vous le conseille vivement. A&C[QWERTY123]Orestes's place is great!!! Location, get around is easy, love the LIC market Orestes recommended. Had brunch there twice! I definitely recommend you to live here! Its truly a good experience and I can't ask for more![QWERTY123]The listing made it sound like it was a private room on the lower level of their home that they do not use. It said private door entrance which I believed would be our own and we would have a room in a location they never came to. The room is next to their office space and they were there quite often playing music and working. The entrance was the one they used and was not private. I feel they made it seem quite different in the description. They also have no instruction about checking out and so we just left in the morning to catch our flight and then he sent me kind of a rude sounding message saying that wasn’t the right thing to do and he deserved an explanation. It did not meet expectations at all.[QWERTY123]Orestes and Christian are welcoming og positive hosts. 
Close to the subway, big room with private big bathroom. 
Refrigirator and microwaveoven in the room. 
Quiet and safe neighbourhood. 
TIP:  use the Citibikes to go round New York. You see a lot more this way.[QWERTY123]Great place for people looking to experience New York City. It’s close to Manhattan while also being a quieter neighborhood. Orestes is an excellent host and had many great recommendations for places to eat and sights to see. Definitely would come here again.[QWERTY123]Orestes's place is really convenient for anyone visiting NYC. Close to a transport hub and walkable it's a great jumping off point regardless of your plans. Orestes is also a fantastic host with a wealth of information about his city. We had an amazing trip, improved by having an amazing place to stay.[QWERTY123]I loved staying with Orestes. The location was unbelievable, and on a block I always wanted to live on (looks like something straight out of Sesame Street). Super close to the trains. I made it to the center of Grand Central in 12 minutes. Highly recommend! And Orestes is a wonderful artist as well... I would have loved to see more of his work. Maybe next time...[QWERTY123]Orestes was an amazing host. He went above and beyond to share local knowledge on everything from trains and best places to eat. The location is superb, literally a 2min walk to the subway which takes u directly into Grand Central/Times sq and one arrives every 5mins. If we were to do this trip again we would definitely stay here. The accommodation is fantastic, quirky décor which we loved, comfy bed and an amazing shower. Thanks a million.[QWERTY123]Sin dudarlo reservar el apartamento de Orestes, tanto por su cercanía con Mahattan como por la amabilidad y el excepcional trato que tiene que te hace sentir como en casa, mi viaje en Nueva York ha sido increíble y parte es por Orestes.[QWERTY123]We found a comfortable bed and futon, and a luxurious bath. The location was quiet while at the same time close to the subway. Directions for my trip from JFK were clear and helpful. I highly recommend Orestes’ place.[QWERTY123]A beautiful room and fantastic host![QWERTY123]Orestes was a wonderful host - very welcoming and friendly. The room itself was clean, cozy, and comfortable, and the location was excellent with easy access to the subway line. Would definitely recommend staying here on your trip to NYC.[QWERTY123]Orestes is kind, thoughtful, and wonderful![QWERTY123]We stayed with Orestes for a week and have nothing but good things to say. Clean with a large bathroom and bedroom the accommodations were great. 
Communication with Orestes was simple and quick.
Thank you![QWERTY123]Orestes is a very nice guy, with a very nice place to stay. Clean and big room / bathroom and a beautifull garden. 

Location is perfect. 1 minute walking from the metro and 10 minutes from Times Square with the metro. 

He is happy to give you al the information you need as well as more then enough privacy to get your rest. 

It has been a great experience, both the city as the accommodation. 

Kind regards,
Pieter[QWERTY123]The house is amazing and comfortable, especially the bathroom! The host is also friendly and approachable. Host can arrange the check in / out time based on our needs :)[QWERTY123]Orestes es un anfitrión muy amable,tiene un lugar realmente muy bonito, cómodo y limpio. La ubicación es buena tiene 3 líneas de subte cerca y es muy fácil llegar desde el JFK. Gracias![QWERTY123]Muy lindo lugar, la casa es acogedora, muy cómoda y limpia. Orestes es atento y preocupado, un muy buen anfitrión.  La ubicación  inmejorable, a una estación de Manhatan.  Nos llevamos un lindo recuerdo de nuestra estancia allí.[QWERTY123]Sehr nette kleine Unterkunft mit sehr netten Gastgebern! 
Die Lage ist perfekt und man ist sehr schnell in Manhattan![QWERTY123]Orestes was a wonderful host with an absolutely beautiful home. The space was exactly what we needed for our stay & the bed was super comfortable.
And honestly, it is by far the BEST location if you want to spend the day in Manhattan-a quick & easy 10 minute subway ride to Midtown.[QWERTY123]Orestes's house is a lovely place to stay while visiting the Big Apple! 

Thanks once again.[QWERTY123]Très facile d'accès depuis JFK. Appartement proche du métro, 10 mn de trajet pour rejoindre Manhattan. Nombreuses possibilités de restauration à proximité.[QWERTY123]The location is on a historic classic block in Queens. The subway is around the corner. Manhattan is just minutes away. The Court Square Dinner around the corner serves great food, big servings at great prices. The Thai place next to the doughnut place is good to. There are several quality dinners within a couple of blocks. It is a much greater value to dine in Queens than Manhattan. At Time Square around Broadway and 48th we ate often at TSQ. Awesome ,delicious big servings. Strong Long Island Ice Tea for just 12 bucks.
 Can't wait to comeback![QWERTY123]We stayed for a week at Orestes place. It's a  nice place to stay and close to Manhattan. Very nearby are 2 metrostations, and it's a short walk to the East River where you can take the ferry.[QWERTY123]Nous avons séjourné 10 jours chez Orestes et c’était parfait. 
L’accueil s’est fait en présence de l’hôte. Nous avions pu communiquer facilement avant notre arrivée sur les lieux pour fixer quelques détails. 
Ensuite tout au long du séjour Orestes a été très disponible pour nous, il nous a donné quelques conseil sur notre séjour et ce que nous devions absolument faire. 
Même si nous sommes dans une maison habitée la chambre est isolée et avec sa propre entrée donc c’est paisible. Hyper bien desservie en termes de transports avec 3 lignes de métro à 5 min à pied de la chambre. Une vue magnifique sur Manhattan et l’East River à 10 min à pied. Idéale au coucher du soleil :) possibilité de prendre le ferry aussi comme moyen de transport pas loin ! Bref tout les avantages de NY avec des hôtes à l’écoute mais pas envahissant :) je recommande vivement cette adresse ![QWERTY123]Really friendly hosts. Location is really peaceful, quiet and very easy to get into the city using the subway. 
[QWERTY123]Great place! Very close to the subway. Orestes was very amiable and we felt like our space was respected. This was our first shared Airbnb experience and it went very well![QWERTY123]I enjoy staying with them.
And It was very convenient to go to Manhattan :)[QWERTY123]Orestes's home is a great place to stay if you want to live like a local! Most would think Long Island City is too far from all the action from Manhattanx but that's not true! It's only 3 stops from Times Square,  and you avoid all the hustle and bustle. The home is a 1t minute walk to the ferries, and you will have a chance to look at the spectacular city from across the water. Mind you,  if you are not ready to socialize, this place is not for you! You will have privacy in your own space but the host does work out of the home office beside your quarters, so you might hear each other when you're both on the same floor. My husband and I were more than happy to chat with Orestes and get some local tips from him so that's a big plus. Overall, it's a great and convenient place to stay and to get an authentic New Yorker experience![QWERTY123]Excelente anfitrión, el inmueble es muy bonito, tal y como aparece en las fotos, la ubicación excelente, sin duda una opción inmejorable para visitar NYC.[QWERTY123]Expect a charming host, a nicely decorated and well appointed room, and an excellent location.[QWERTY123]Location is so perfect and minutes away from the noise of Manhattan.  Easy to get to from airport, 1 subway stop to Manhattan, and incredibly great hosts![QWERTY123]Very fine place, very well connected by subways (3 lines), the room is big and quiet with AC. The private bathroom is luxurious. The hosts are very prevenants and gave good advices. It's the place to be to explore NYC in peace!!!! I recommand++++[QWERTY123]Excellent emplacement : pratique d'accès depuis et vers l'aéroport JFK, plusieurs lignes de métro situées à proximité, quartier calme et reposant, beaucoup de commerces utiles. Salle de bain spacieuse et agréable. Propreté impeccable assurée par Orestes et sa femme de ménage. Disponibilité et réactivité de notre hôte. 
Nous n'avions pas bien compris l'annonce. Nous pensions que l'entrée indépendante était à notre usage exclusif ce qui nous assurerait une meilleure intimité et que notre hôte utilisait l'entrée située à l'étage. En fait, c'est une porte qui est empruntée par tout le monde : voyageurs, hôte et amis de l'hôte. Cela ne remet pas en cause notre séjour, c'est une mauvaise interprétation de notre part. L'avantage certain est que nous savions lorsque notre hôte s’absentait.[QWERTY123]Nice location - excellent host. We enjoyed this stay in the home of Oreste.[QWERTY123]Great location within LIC. Everything as described and pictured. Only sorry that the weather didn’t permit use of the lovely garden![QWERTY123]We had some nice days in Orestes apartment. The location is perfect - near East River.[QWERTY123]You can expect a specious room, a large and very well equiped bathroom and a large garden. The subway is very nearby and Manhattan by metro is less than 10 minutes. JFK by metro and AirTrain is about 1,5 hour.[QWERTY123]This is a great place to stay. The accommodation is ideally placed for visits to the Big Apple. Situated in Queens, the historic house is beautifully cared for. Your own private entrance leads to a spacious room that is clean and comfortable. There is a small fridge and microwave, a large bed settee and a very comfortable bed. It was a nice touch to have a dressing gown to use when accessing the well equipped bathroom which adjoins the bedroom. Orestes was brilliant at communicating with us and although we didn’t get to see him in person, his partner Chris  was so friendly and helpful, giving us great advice regarding restaurants and places to see that we felt like honoured guests throughout our stay. I booked this accommodation on the basis of previous reviews and i certainly have no reservation about recommending a stay here. Thank you Orestes and Chris, we hope to come back.[QWERTY123]This Airbnb is a great place to explore NYC and surrounding areas. It’s only 1 stop from Manhattan, (it’s actually closer to Manhattan than some of Manhattan!). Orestes is a lovely, friendly, and welcoming host. We also had a special doggy welcome from Gus, which was lovely.... a home is not a home without a fur baby! The subway stop is also really close,  a 2 minute walk. 
To be honest, I could have spent my whole stay in NYC in that shower, oh my god... what an amazing shower and a gorgeous bathroom. 
The attention to detail is great too, with lovely artwork. Oh, and there’s a traditional diner around the corner that serves lush breakfast!  
Thank you Orestes for a lovely stay and for some great tips. If you’re ever in Wales, we’d love to return the favour![QWERTY123]My wife and I had a wonderful stay at Orestes’s place. The room was very comfortable and with an entrance right off the hall we felt comfortable coming and going. All the amenities were great and the house had a wonderful design. The location is central to many great restaurants and the subway to midtown. I personally enjoyed burger garage and the micro brewery fifth hammer, both right down the street. All of this added up to a wonderful stay for my wife and I. This is a part of NY everyone should experience once.[QWERTY123]Orestes place is wonderful. The location in Queens is excellent, just a few minutes walk to the metro that gets you in to the city in a few minutes and JFK in about 40 minutes. The room is very comfortable and a lovely bed. The bathroom is exceptional, with large shower and steam room. There’s a microwave and refrigerator provided and a few coffee sachets. Whilst the room is private, it is adjacent to Orestes workshop, which is fine and has direct access into his apartment upstairs. The area is safe and nice to walk around. It’s only a 10 minute walk to the ferry terminal too and I’d recommend doing that as it’s a nice walk along the river too to the next stop down. We also thoroughly recommend the Court Square Diner around the corner for any time of day, the breakfast is amazing. Will certainly return next time we’re in New York and recommend.[QWERTY123]My sister and I shared the room for 5 nights. We found Orestes to be very friendly and helpful. He has a very calm demeanor and we felt like we were staying with an old friend rather than a stranger. The room is comfortable and quiet, and the shower in the bathroom is the best! Very close to trains and you can also walk to Gantry Park and take the ferry to Brooklyn or Manhattan."	40.7477081911474	-73.94739547980599	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/12937	4	130.0	0.825
96	26520	"I had a very nice stay. The room is pretty big, with ample storage/closet space. TV with satellite, wi-fi internet service, though it can be sketchy at times with the router being two floors down in the kitchen.  Ceiling fan and A/C unit keep it cool as well.
Great neighborhood, very safe, lots of young families outside a lot. Plenty of food options just a few blocks away (though we do have a great kitchen downstairs), as well as C and G trains very close, just a 25-30min. commute to Manhattan.
Overall, no complaints...I really enjoyed my first visit to NYC and Brooklyn.[QWERTY123]Erica was an absolute dream of a host.

So easy to communicate with and the description of the house was spot on and all absolutely wonderful.

Erica was easy to get hold of if needed and so lovely to chat with. The house was quiet but once I met all the guys it felt really homely when you wanted it to. They are so lovely and keep the space (there is a lot of it) immaculate. I liked it so much I was so sad to leave!

I would 100% recommend dealing with Erica to anyone looking for a lovely place to stay in a cute part of Brooklyn so close to everything, and likewise as a guest too![QWERTY123]Erica was a very good host. Everything was as advertised on the posting. Every issue that came up during my one month stay, was dealt with efficiently and effectively by Erica. The house is in a great location close to the C and G lines of the subway so coming and going was quite easy. Overall would stay again at Erica's in the future and would by happy to recommended to anyone.[QWERTY123]Erica is a very kind and courteous host. Whenever a problem concerning the room or the house occurred during the three months of my stay, I was easily able contact her and she would take care of it. 

The room is very big and located on the top floor. It has a ceiling fan which makes summer temperatures more enjoyable. During my stay, Erica also added a desk and a chair. 

There is a washing machine and a dryer in the house. It should however be noted that the use of the washing machine costs $ 2 per load.

The house is ideally located between the C and G trains. The Clinton Hill area is very charming with lots of green and nice cafés, restaurants etc.
[QWERTY123]We stayed at Ericas house for one month and enjoyed our stay very much. The old house is in a great quiet neighborhood and next to 2 different subway stations, so you can reach all places in  manhatten and brooklyn very easy. You find great places to eat and the supermarket only a few hundret meters away. The athmosphere of the old house with lots of wood gives you a very warmth feeling. The heating works well and Erica is doing her best to make you feel like home. All other people living in the house were realy smart and nice to talk with but hardly to see. The house is very clean and looks better in real than on the pictures. We would love to come again! Thanks Erica[QWERTY123]We had a really nice stay at Erica's place. We stayed there for 3 months during the long, cold winter and Erica took care of the problems we had very quickly. Our room was large, bright and sunny, and the kitchen was well-equipped. This lovely quiet street figures typical architecture with red-brick houses.[QWERTY123]Everything was uncomplicated. Erica was a friendly host. When a bathroom problem occurred Erica took care immediately. Nice neighborhood.[QWERTY123]I stayed for 6 weeks in Clinton Hill and found it to be a very pleasant experience. 

Firstly, the house and room are much nicer than the photos would lead you to believe (honestly). The room is particularly spacious with loads of storage space, a desk and chair, and Erica also installed an air conditioner during my stay which made the hot summer days much more manageable when at home. 
It should really be noted in the description, however, that the washer takes a $2 charge per load. 

The area is very quiet and seems very family orientated, lending itself to a great sense of safety when walking home late at night. 
Proximity to the G and C train means access to Manhattan is simple and frequent. 

My only thumbs down would be the initial cleanliness of my room and the wifi. 
The room was quite dusty and evidence of the previous inhabitant could be found underneath the bed/couch when I took to hovering it on my first day. I also had to deal with some cockroaches/bugs (though this could just be New York living in general and me coming from a colder climate). 
The wifi is also very patchy. A possible fix would be to locate the router in the kitchen (it currently sits on the ground level two stories below the room) for a fairer distribution of its signal. For those without a laptop, don't expect a smartphone to be able to pick up the signal too well in the room. You'll have to do most of your browsing in the kitchen. 

Overall, I was extremely satisfied with my stay. Erica is also particularly lovely and the few occasions we crossed paths during my stay were full of laughs. I would recommend this space for couples on a long city break or indeed interns/travelling workers like myself.[QWERTY123]Erica's house is great!  I absolutely enjoyed my stay in this room.  I stayed in the room for 2.5 months, and as a Pratt student, you can't beat the location.  The room is at the top of the house, and is super quiet.  The bathroom is shared with only one other room, but has plenty of room for storage, and the tub is great!  The room has an AC unit, ceiling fan, and working radiators.  Windows give plenty of light as well.  Kitchen is fully equipped with plenty of cooking pans, and utensils.  Erica is a great host and was very responsive to any questions or concerns I had.[QWERTY123]Erica was an absolutely great host who was very responsive to any questions that we had! Her place was great and we really enjoyed our stay there! Would recommend to anyone looking to stay in a great area of Brooklyn![QWERTY123]I was very so happy when I get to the room .. The room was same in the pics .. I love the place very much and you can get the the subway G line very easy .. Erica was so nice and I didn't see her very much but she always reply my question all the times .. I very enjoyed staying here and feeling more comfortable like Home .. And the people are so nice and kind .. I'm so happy for my NYC trip this time ..will come back again :)[QWERTY123]My stay at Erica's was great. Beautiful location next to lots of restaurants and bars. Even though this is a shared space, it feels very private as if I had booked the entire home myself. Check in and check out were effortless.[QWERTY123]I had a bunch of family visiting and needed some extra space to house them as they couldn't all fit in my apartment. Erica's place was convenient and close by! Would rent again![QWERTY123]Erica’s place is so spacious and exactly as shown in the pictures. I loved my stay here and would recommend it to anyone who needs to stay in Brooklyn for a bit.[QWERTY123]You can’t find a better location in Brooklyn. Such a great neighbourhood and the space is perfect and huge for NY. Erica responded and fixed every concern I had almost immediately. You will love this place."	40.68698085198674	-73.96571807339976	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/26520	3	125.0	0.9
97	26540	"Great location and very accomodating host. Loads of bars and restaurants very close by. This studio (not a one bedroom apartment) is great for single traveller or couple. Only downside was lack of blinds or curtains so no privacy in bed and very early sunny wake-up. Thanks, Matty.[QWERTY123]Had a great stay! Small lovely apartment, nice decor, big bathroom with hot tub and steambath. Excellent East Village location, short walk to cool shops and restaurants in Lower East Side, Greenwich Village and other parts of lower Manhattan. Easy transaction with pick up of keys from the next door shop and leaving them in the apartment when we left. Professional and smooth communication with Danette, who had also provided a folder with good suggestions on restaurants, practicalities etc. Thanks so much! :)[QWERTY123]You couldn't dream of a better location in the East Village,right in the middle of everything.The apartment is charming and very cosy.The bathroom is unbelivable for a place that size.Danette has been great as I was looking for a place to stay at the very last moment.She was very responsive and helpful.I will come again,for sure.
Thanks again,Danette![QWERTY123]The apartment is very very nice and the location is great. It is newly remodeled, clean and decorated with impeccable taste. I is ideal for a 1 or 2 people. Danette was very accommodating and helpful. Thanks so much![QWERTY123]I had a great time staying at Danette's place. It is a very clean apartment on the first floor so no hauling luggage up the stairs. It is just two blocks away from St. Mark's Place and a bustling night life, but surprisingly the apartment is very quiet and I slept well every night. The bathroom is great, with a steam bath and hot tub. Contrary to a previous review, there are now curtains for the windows that ensure privacy and block out the morning light. Danette is very accommodating. Whenever I contacted her, be it before or during the trip, she was very prompt. I would definitely stay again. Thank you again Danette![QWERTY123]Danettes Apartment was exactly the way she discribed it and the pictures lived up to their promise! The neighborhood was one of my favourites and the transport connenction is quite perfect (Line 6 up and down the East including Central Station). The little studio was clean an quiet, the bath (including huge shower) has been very compftable and the bed was cosy. 
All our communication was fast and Danette is realy dependable - no problems with the key or transaction at all! So absolutely  recommendable! Thanks![QWERTY123]The apt space is wonderful for 1 person or a couple. It's beautifully kept, very clean, and has modern amenities, including the awesome jacuzzi-style tub! The area is vibrant and thriving, with lots of great NYC attractions close by, but the best part of that is that the apt is shielded from all of the activity. The place is a quiet sanctuary in a hip neighborhood.  Danette is absolutely charming and very easy to work with. Check-in/out were a breeze, and she was really helpful to us. We will absolutely stay here again if given the chance. Is it possible to give her/the place a few more stars?? :)[QWERTY123]Danette's apartment was the perfect home base for our trip.  Some of the highlights for us were: location, it's on a street with many restaurants and in a neighborhood packed with restaurants and bars and is a close walk to other cute areas like Greenwich and Soho.  Neatness, Danette's place is organized, clean and well maintained.  Communication, it was easy to communicate with Danette, she is organized and kind.  And last but not least, air-conditioning, it was very hot during our stay and her cool apartment gave us some relief!  We couldn't have asked for more!  Thanks Danette for everything![QWERTY123]Danette's apartment is the perfect home away from home. We usually stay in a high priced hotel with very little character and space and this was a welcome relief for a weekend in the city. It's most comfortable for 1-2 people max and it was incredibly easy working with Danette to get keys and information. Also there's a handy welcome book with instructions for our stay including takeout menus! She really did think of everything!

As everyone else mentioned, it is quite a bathroom with a steam shower and large soaking tub. Furniture and bed is quite comfy and the best part was the A/C which in the summer can make or break your stay.

As for location, it was right smack in the middle of everything. Turn the corner and you'll find bars and restaurants galore although it's not close enough where it bothers you at night. The NR and 6 lines are blocks away and cabs are easy enough to hail, even at 2am. 

All in all, a wonderful stay with a wonderful host. Just promise us that you'll treat her home like you treat your own so we can look forward to staying again![QWERTY123]This apartment is an absolute winner and so its its host. Danette was lovely and very helpful. The apartment is great. The location is UNBELIEVABLE if you are into the cafe/music culture of New York. It is great value considering it is new york too...the east village has so much excitement and atmosphere and this apartment is right in the centre of it, but SO quiet for new york as it is located at the back of the building. FANTASTIC I hope to come back again soon! Thanks Danette[QWERTY123]Our stay couldn't have been any better. Danette was super friendly, flexible with our demands for arrival and departure times, and communication always was fast and reliable. The apartment was exactly as described, modern, clean, cozy, well equipped and well kept. There even was a starter pack supplied with useful information on the neighborhood, maps of NYC, subway maps, menus for ordering food and everything else you could ever need to feel at home directly from the start.  You are staying right in the middle of where everything happens,  with nice bars and restaurants around the corner, subway and busses around the corner, but still, since the apt is facing to the back of the building, it is extraordinarily quiet for New York standards. Just perfect. We would come back any time.

[QWERTY123]Lovely place to stay in NYC ! We've really enjoyed our stay. 
Thanks to Danette !!!
[QWERTY123]This is a great little place to stay ideally located in the east village. The kitchen is huge - although we didn't use it once as there are so many great places to eat and drink nearby. Danette was really easy to deal with and always fast to respond to any questions. Her food and drink suggestions are also top-notch.

I would definitely stay here again next time I'm in NYC.[QWERTY123]If you are reading tbis you have found the perfect NYC apartment. Location is unbeatable, the apartment is excellent and Danette couldn't be more helpful or friendly. This apartment was our base for the trip of a lifetime -  go for it![QWERTY123]My husband and I stayed for 9 days at Danette´s place this spring and it could not be better. The apartment is small but very comfy and clean, with a large bathtub, and a well equipped kitchen. The bed is soft enough and there were 2 kits of white towels for us. Staying at an apartment gives you chance to have breakfast and dinner at home…  and Danette was very kind and friendly giving us tips where to find the groceries, drugstores, taxi to go back to airport etc; everything was very well organized to have guests.
If you are in NY not only for the tourist highlights or shopping but to be in a nice neighborhood to live as a New Yorker, you are in the right place: in East Village you´ll find a lot of pubs, cafés, restaurants every corner… and you are just a few blocks from Soho and Greenwich Village.  The Subway is just a couple of blocks to get to Up or Downtown; as there is so much to see, we always came back late at night and East Village was perfect to have something to eat and drink before we get home.
Our trip was simply perfect! Thanks, Danette!
[QWERTY123]Danette’s place is even lovelier than the photos make it out to be. We didn’t run into the nosy neighbour once so this was absolutely not an issue. The place is so cozy and makes great use of the small space with too many stylish touches to name. It instantly feels like home. The steam shower is a godsend. There’s a plethora of vegan restaurants in the area that were some of the best vegan meals I’ve ever had, including Mother of Pearl and Ladybird. Plenty of amazing bars are within walking distance as well, such as Fat Buddha and Attaboy. Overall Danette’s place added so much to our time in New York and we would definitely stay again.

She even took me for a walk around the corner to show me the best nail salon! Loved every minute of my stay.[QWERTY123]Sally's apartment is very cozy, clean and well lit. During the day there's a warm sun that lights up the living room and at night you feel that every lamp is right on its place, creating a very relaxing and warm atmosphere. My boyfriend and I loved the neighborhood. It was sometimes even difficult to leave the East Village! The negotiation was easy and simple and Sally was always very sweet. She even offered us some nice breakfast when we arrived from our long trip. It was a lovely experience![QWERTY123]Wow, this was one of the best apartments I've stayed in - and I've stayed in a lot! Such a pleasant, charming (and large) space with lots of precious oddities to enjoy. To say that the location is ideal is a bit of an understatement - this apartment is in the middle of anything you'll need in the city. I barely left the East Village in the ten days I was staying here! Friends that came to visit were in awe at what a perfect place this was. I'll do everything I can to stay here next time I'm in New York![QWERTY123]I loved Sally's apartment. It was clean and comfortable, and located in a great area in the East Village with tons of little shops and restaurants all around. Sally was very welcoming and friendly, and meeting her to receive the keys was easy and painless. She even organized a basket of things to use while we were there and included magazines and information about NYC- where to eat, what to do, etc. It was my first time using AirBnB, and this was a wonderful experience. Would definitely love to stay here again if I got the chance![QWERTY123]Excellent location. Friendly, helpful and accommodating owner. Very comfortable home away from home, would recommend to anyone.[QWERTY123]L'appartamento di Sally è semplice e carino e molto tranquillo, in una zona bella e molto viva di New York.
Non abbiamo mai incontrato Sally di persona ma è sempre stata molto disponibile via mail e si è preoccupata che il nostro soggiorno nel suo appartamento fosse il migliore possibile.[QWERTY123]We had a great stay. The appartment is perfect, well located, well decorated, spacious, very clean. Sally was welcoming and easy to deal with. We highly recommend to stay at her place.[QWERTY123]Sally's apartment is great.  It is larger than it looks in the photos, with 2 spacious rooms with lots of light.  It's on the 4th floor, but climbing 3 flights of stairs is not an issue.  It is in an excellent location, close to Tompkins Sq park, the 6, N & R trains, St Marks, lots of restaurants and bars etc.  Sally was very reliable, easy to deal with and we loved a number of the bars and restaurants she recommended.  We would not hesitate to recommend her apartment.[QWERTY123]Our stay at Sally's apartment was great. We spent there 17 nights and everything went well. Apartment was clean, cozy and full of beautiful little details. Location is great, neighbourhood is awesome, everything you need is near you. Sally was really easy to communite with and answered all emails quickly. Very good first airbnb experience and I would recommend her apartment to all![QWERTY123]I really recommend Sally as a host! The communication could not have been better, she made sure we'd find our way from the airport to her apartment and she was very welcoming. She's a lovely and caring person and everything you want your host to be. The apartment was great! It was clean, tidy and felt very warm! If you're looking for a place with a good vibe, that's where you want to go! I'd definitely book this apartment again! The location was also great, lots of cool cafés, restaurants and stores nearby.[QWERTY123]El lugar es un oasis en medio de la agitada vida neoyorkina. Se respira y siente un ambiente de paz y calma. Cada objeto y su disposición en el espacio hablan de un hogar cuidado en cada detalle. Fue increible quedarnos 8 noches ahi. 
Es uno de mis barriis favoritos en manhattan. Mucho artista de todas las edades (muchos de los grandes nombres del arte americano desarrollaron su obra ahi) y mucha gente joven tambien. Ojo si quieres trabajar ahi porque el internet es muy lento, en ese caso hay un café bajo la casa que funciona bien[QWERTY123]It's a cute zen NY flat. Sally is very nice, answer super fast and was very comprehensive of my long flight delays. Only downside is the futon bed which is too hard for me."	40.72880079483676	-73.98192348714144	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/26559	1	140.0	0.85
99	26785	"Superb host, courteous, really concerned about making sure everyone's comfortable, super responsive and pleasant[QWERTY123]Great little apartment in a great neighborhood.  I told Dani that we'd be arriving at 7 a.m. and there was a note on the door so we would know we were in the right place. She was waiting for us. She lives downstairs and asked several times if we needed anything.  Fortunately, we had no problems.  

The description didn't mention the fabulous claw-foot tub in the bathroom or the collection of menus provided so guests can acquaint themselves with the neighborhood's huge variety of dining options. 

The next time I visit New York, I will definitely look up Dani's place first.[QWERTY123]Terrific place!  Dani and her family are very hospitable, the area is lovely, and the apartment was perfect for us.  The collection of menus was extensive - and very useful, and the kitchen is fully stocked with dishes, dry goods, coffee, pots and pans, etc.  A window air conditioner and a floor-standing fan kept the place nice and cool, even during a heat wave.  We'll definitely book the apartment for our next trip![QWERTY123]My son and I enjoyed our stay in Dani's bright little apartment.  We had the privacy and convenience of an apartment, but really felt like ""guests"" of Dani's due to her friendly helpfulness and the little amenities such as coffee beans for morning coffee and menus of the interesting cafes/restaurants in the area. We would stay here again![QWERTY123]Dani and the apartment were WONDERFUL. The place was clean and very welcoming. I didn't actually meet Dani until a few days into my stay (she and her family were out of town), but a friend of theirs let me in and everything went very smoothly. When I did meet her, she was very kind! The neighborhood is very safe and close to the subway to get into Manhattan. I would recommend this place to anyone and everyone.[QWERTY123]Dani's place was perfect - clean, bright, inviting, quiet, private and accommodating. Communication with Dani was great both by email and telephone. We were traveling with a 4 year old and a 10 month old. The size of the apartment was just right. There was a playground a few blocks away. Lots of young parents in the neighborhood, which was safe and friendly. I was able to find parking without any trouble. Everything was as described, plus! THANK YOU![QWERTY123]Dani and her family were awesome! Two thumbs way up! Their place is the perfect Brooklyn retreat: very clean, very quiet and very comfortable. Dani was beyond accommodating in helping my husband and I make the most of our stay in Brooklyn with local recommendations and tips on where explore by bike. The location is super convenient to local transportation and within walking distance to Prospect Park and the millions of places to eat and play in Park Slope. Their place is on an adorable tree lined street and the apartment is in the back for added peace and quiet. I will definitely look forward to staying at her place again and would highly recommend it! Thank you Dani for making our stay in Brooklyn so great![QWERTY123]We stayed at Dani's place whilewe were looking for an apartment to rent in Brooklyn. Dani's place is really cozy, with plenty of light; plus, it's in a very nice and quiet neighborhood. Dani is a wonderful host and really helped us to get familiar with Brooklyn.[QWERTY123]My family and I arrived from Guatemala and we had a very good time in Dani's place.  Dani is a very nice person, she is very hospitable and kind.  We really enjoyed our visit.   This place is located in a very nice area of Park Slope, eveything is close, subway, restaurants, supermarket....great neighborhood.   Dani's place is really nice, clean, quiet, private and confortable.   We felt like we were in our own house.  We cooked some meals and saved, the Kitchen is complete!!.   We definitely look forward to stay again in this Place.  Thank you vey mych Dani for making our stay so confortable and nice.   As I told you... for sure, we will be back soon.    

Jorge F.[QWERTY123]This is a tasteful, clean, comfortable, conveniently located apartment, with well-stocked refrigerator and cupboard to boot.  What more can we add except that our hosts are gracious and thoughtful. We're looking forward to our third stay next month. 

[QWERTY123]I can't recommend this spot any higher. Clean, lovely space that absolutely MADE my parents' recent visit to Park Slope. They'll be back....!![QWERTY123]Dani's place is perfectly situated for someone who wants more than just the tourist experience of New York city.  It is in a great neighborhood and is an extremely comfortable place to stay. Dani, herself, combines all those things my family and I like: she's communicative, thoughtful, artistic, extremely clear and capable, and a just a wonderful host. We really appreciated how Dani's place combined the comforts of 21st living with the grace and style of early 20th century buildings.  The bed was so comfortable that we had trouble getting out of it on the first morning; we REALLY appreciated the provided computer with internet access; and because the apartment is at the back of the building, it was completely quiet and peaceful.  We had easy access to the F,R,N, subways, and because of the liveliness of Park Slope, we never felt uncomfortable during the walk from the station to Dani's place--even at 1:00AM. Staying at Dani's allowed us to feel more like a part of the New York community.  We will be staying there next time we go to NYC, and we are recommending it to ALL our friends![QWERTY123]Dani and her family were the most perfect hosts anyone can imagine. After a long transatlantic flight on the way home to California, they provided a quiet, careful, and most comfortable environment. In their house, the guest can't help but feel cozy and pampered.

Thank you Dani. We will keep your address and phone number for many more visits to come.

Tamas and Annamaria.[QWERTY123]My wife, daughter and I had an excellent stay with Dani. The apartment was clean and very charming. Furthermore, Dani was a great and very helpful host. We wouldn’t hesitate to stay with Dani in the future.[QWERTY123]We had a great NYC Marathon weekend, made all the more pleasant by our comfortable and now familiar surroundings. Our third stay with Dani.  We look forward to more.

Abe & Reva[QWERTY123]Dani and her family made our visit very welcoming and comfortable. We love Park Slope and we now feel the same about Dani, her family and the Green Guest House. We look forward to our next stay.
Tom and Kathi[QWERTY123]Having lived in Park Slope for 6 years, my family and I came back for a visit and staying at Dani's felt like being back home! The apartment was just perfect - quiet, clean, accessible to the subway, and near great food and coffee places. Cafe Regular is fabulous and right around the corner - best almond croissants and pain au chocolats! Dani was a wonderful host. We only wish we could have stayed longer and will be back soon to stay with them again! My advice to everyone is forget the hotel and stay at Dani's. You will be so happy you did![QWERTY123]My daughter, Kate, and I were looking for a quiet, comfortable apartment for New Years weekend.  We did not want to stay in Manhattan preferring a more residential less congested area. Dani's Park Slope Green Guest House far exceeded our expectations. It was perfect!  There were plenty of restaurants and stores in the area. The subway was conveniently  located only a few blocks away.  Dani and her family couldn't have been more welcoming. We can't thank them enough for making us feel at home. The next time I need to stay in the city for a few nights, I will be sure to contact Dani.[QWERTY123]We were so pleased with our stay.  The apartment was spotless.  The bed was comfortable.  It was very quiet, almost no street noise.  The location was perfect for us.  All and all it was a seamless stay.  We will be booking with Dani in the future.[QWERTY123]Hi Dani, 

Thanks for your mail at our home. 
We have been fine and it was great. We felt welcome. The refrigerator was filled and the beds made. 
If we had had something to ask you was there for an answer. 
For us it's just one thing to leave an apartment as you find it. 
Thanks for the hospitality. We will tell this address to family and friends.
Greetings from Hans and Gea van Wezel.
[QWERTY123]Our decision to stay at Dani's Green House was really good. Before booking the place we had a lot of questions - Dani's answers came immediately and were very helpful. 
We stayed there 12 nights with our two boys (4 1/2 years and almost 2 years old). Dani was always relaxed, even when the boys cried. She borrowed us her stroller for the whole stay. 
The kitchen was fully equipped, even with fruits, teas, coffee, filtered tap water... Dani was very nice and always willing to help.
The Green House is a quiet place in a nice neighborhood with cafes and restaurants and the big prospect park (10 minutes to walk). We recommend Dani's Guest House for families, too. We would come back at any time.[QWERTY123]The Park Slope Green Guest House was everything we expected and more. Dani was a wonderful host and had the apartment stocked with everything you would need to feel at home. She also took care to see that the place was stocked with literature on what to explore in Brooklyn and NYC as a whole. The apartment and area in Brooklyn was an ideal place for my family to explore life in a real NYC neighborhood with playgrounds and everything you could need close by. Thanks to Dani for sharing this special space from which to explore one of the world's greatest cities.[QWERTY123]I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at Park Slope Green Guest House. Dani and James were most accommodating. Notwithstanding Dani having to leave on a family emergency, James was there to greet me at an ungodly hour due to a flight delay and helped me with my luggage. I felt at home in a very spacious, clean and well equipped apartment. I was able to sleep well, relax, watch some TV and search the internet/respond to critical emails on a guest computer. Dani did not have a problem with me staying late in the afternoon on my day of departure which I really appreciated. I would not hesitate to recommend this establishment and hope to return.[QWERTY123]We really enjoyed living in Dani's house for some days.
The rooms were perfectly clean, bright, inviting and calm.
The atmosphere was very pleasant and we appreciated Dani's kindness and warm hospitality. She was a wonderful host.
If we are given the chance of spending some days again, we'll certainly do so.
We recommend this place to anyone and everyone.[QWERTY123]I stayed with Dani for   2 nights. On my part there was a mix up on my part of the reservation. i very much enjoyed my stay with her and her family.This was my first time ever using Airbnb and  she made it a good stay. She was there when you needed  her to be   but never  pushy. all of the pictures are   true reflection of her property and her family. i would recommend  any one to Dani , especially those who are  very interested in  being environmentally friendly.[QWERTY123]We had such a wonderful time! I would recommend this to anyone, the brownstone was beautiful so clean and relaxing. Dani was waiting for us when we arrived along with our son who just moved to Brooklyn. We arrived late due to a traffic problem, she let our son wait inside until we arrived. I can't wait to  our next visit! Thank You so much Dani miss the morning walk for bagels already. Plus the community was so friendly, love Park Slope. The Falzone family[QWERTY123]We unfortunately did not get to see Dani too much because we had a full schedule but she was great.  We really loved the place and the neighborhood  was really nice.  I think that we have found our lodging for all of our future NYC adventures.  The apartment had a good vibe and it was filled with everything you need for a trek around the city (tourist info guides,tons of menus and a i mac with full internet access) .You can tell Dani and her husband really spent time to cater to all of the guests that stay there.  It was a great experience.[QWERTY123]Lovely, convenient, peaceful, clean, eco green and comfy.....Dani's place was just what I needed....I slept well and felt at home....Dani is an excellent host, a very thoughtful and lovely lady who was there to be of help, if needed.  The apartment was stocked with amenities, a few of which I forgot.......I'll be back!.[QWERTY123]We had a perfect stay.  The apartment was very clean and in the perfect location for visiting our children. We will definitely stay there again.[QWERTY123]Everything that we wanted, spacious, clean and in a nice location. Dani was very helpful and even let us leave our bags with her until late at night when we were leaving...... Many thanks Mike from the UK[QWERTY123]Dani was very considerate and the accomodations were excellent. I was in charge of booking our band of four into a Park Slope location, and Dani's place served as the perfect place. We would recommend this place to anyone![QWERTY123]We stayed at the Green Guest House for 5 nights in May 2011, and had a fantastic experience. Below are my thoughts on some specific aspects of the apartment that I hope you find useful. LOCATION: After having lived in New York for 4 years previously, my partner and I specifically searched for rental properties in Park Slope for our vacation back to NYC because it is a great, walkable neighborhood with plenty of restaurants, bars and entertainment options. We also find that Park Slope has a small-town feel despite being in the largest city in the U.S. The location of the Green Guest House is on a safe street where we felt very comfortable walking, even late in the evening. It is about 3-4 blocks (a 5 minute walk) from the nearest subway station at “4th and 9th” where you can catch the F train or the R train to Manhattan (~15-minute ride to Downtown Manhattan) or the G train to other cool Brooklyn neighborhoods such as Carroll Gardens and Williamsburg. Some of our favorite nearby attractions that you can walk to in 10 minutes or less from the Green Guest House include Prospect Park, 12th Street Bar for drinks and darts, Blue Ribbon Steak House, the Park Slope Food Co-Op (largest food co-op in the U.S. with >26,000 members), Perch for an awesome breakfast and Union Hall for drinks and Bocce Ball. APARTMENT: The apartment is AMAZING by New York standards. It is a second-floor walk-up on the back side of the building and overlooks the backyards of the houses on 12th and 11th streets – as a result this is a very quiet unit with no street noise. The apartment was very clean, and the décor/furniture is pleasant and appropriate. There is plenty of space for two people – if staying with more than two people, the alcove/bedroom has nice, heavy drapes that can be pulled across the walkway to the living room to allow for some privacy. The kitchen is huge by New York standards. It is nicely re-done and is fully stocked with dishes, plates, glasses, etc. and other utensils needed for cooking in the apartment. In addition, a number of condiments and coffees are available for guests’ perusal. The bathroom is small (only comfortable for one person at a time), but clean and has a full bathtub and shower with good water pressure. There is TV with cable and an a computer with an internet connection in the unit for guests to use. Dani has also put together a binder full of take out menus for nearby restaurants. HOSTS: Dani and her family were great hosts. When we made our reservation a couple of months before our trip, Dani contacted me within 24 hours to make arrangements for our arrival. She also contacted me again a couple of days before our arrival to confirm our plans and was available and responsive when we notified her of our travel delays. When we arrived, Dani met...[QWERTY123]We had a great stay - the apartment is in a great neighborhood, and was very comfortable.  We'd love to come back sometime![QWERTY123]Hi, I stayed 6 nights in this lovely apartment. Dani is super organised so everything was very well set up. The apartment had everything you could wish for and was super clean. I felt safe in this accomodation and I was a solo traveler (and female) It was very hot while I was there so the a/c and fan were perfect. The underground is about 3 blocks away (10 mins walk) which brought you straight into the city (took about 20-30 mins). Prospect Park and Brooklyn Library and Brooklyn Museum are all within walking distance (30-40 mins walk), all of which are well worth a visit. I felt very safe walking back and forth to the underground from Danis. Dani's is just off 5th Avenue which has tons of shops and restaurants, the further you walk towards 1st street the more expensive the shops seem to get...  For nearby cheap eats Fatoosh was lovely and the organic restaurant two doors up from 5th Avenue and 5th street  was top class and has a lovely yard out back. Dani was very helpful in every regard including giving directions. Thanks Dani, hope to see you again in 2012![QWERTY123]We stayed at Dani's place for 5 nights in June.  The apartment is lovely and Dani and her family were very welcoming, warm and friendly.  Park Slope is a great area and we really enjoyed our stay. Would definately go back there is nothing negative to point out.[QWERTY123]I investigated good neighborhoods to stay while visiting NYC. This was a great area. Plenty of shops, restraurants, water holes and quick access to the subway at 4th Avenue and 9th Street. Bed was more that adequate, soft pillows and a couch that made into a bed. A well stocked kitchen. Filtered water dispenser, coffee maker, toaster, gas stove and oven, no microwave. Small bath but all I needed. Good water pressure with hot water. And a factor that I can't overlook is how quiet it was. I would highly recommend staying at Park Slope Green Guest House. Dani greeted us with open arms and was a great host. We came in late and left early so we never saw her again. She provides menu's for the area. It was almost like you were at home.[QWERTY123]I stayed at Dani's 4 nights while visiting my son who lives in Park Slope.  Dani was very friendly and a great hostess.  She let me keep my luggage late so that I did not have to take it all over with me on the day of check out.  The apartment was very clean, well stocked and in a great location.  It was very easy to get to the subway.  I would definitely stay at Dani's again when I visit my son.[QWERTY123]This was my second stay at the Park Slope Green Guest House. Dani is great and I feel right at home. I wouldn't think of staying any place else in Brooklyn or New York, for that matter![QWERTY123]Park Slope Green Guest house was great! It was our first time using Airbnb and loved the service! The guest house was very clean, cool(we were there in the middle of the summer) and was in a great location. I have lot of allergies  and had no problems at Dani's place, I even slept better there on the organic mattress then i do at home haha!  I would recommend this place to anyone especially if you are planning on staying for a  week or more like we did![QWERTY123]My husband and I were delighted with our stay at Dani's.  The apartment was spacious (by NY standards) and spotless!  We especially appreciated the airconditioning and fan since we happened to be staying in Brooklyn on days with record breaking high temperatures. We would definitely stay at Dani's again on future trips to Brooklyn.[QWERTY123]We only stayed for one night due to change of travel plans, but it was all very comfortable. The appartment is located in a very nice area of Brooklyn with good connection to Manhattan. It is very clean and neat and equipped with everything you need. Dani was also very kind and our previous contact was promising. Due to family affairs Dani was not in NY, but she sent a friend of hers to give us the keys, who was also very nice. We completely can recommend to stay at Danis appartment and will come back next time we will be in New York.[QWERTY123]My husband and I were very pleased with the accamodations
 at Dani's. We had  a bad experience at another place we chose off the internet( not airbnb) and were a little afraid of what we might get.
I am used to staying in NY, my daughter lives here & I visit often. This was one of the nicest and spacious( for NY living) apartments. The kitchen was top notch. The seperate alcove with the queen bed is a luxury in many places in NY. The area has many restaurant choices. Shopping, even Lowes is near by.You could walk 4 blocks to the movies if you like.
Dani could not meet us but made great other arrangements and we never skipped a beat in check in or out. I would highly recommend this  apt. for your stay, It could accomadate 4 with the pull out sofa, comfortably.
Thanks Dani!!!!![QWERTY123]Our stay in the Park Slope Green Guest House was wonderful and it felt like home from the minute we arrived. The place was very clean and spacious. The location is extremely convenient to restaurants, shopping and the park, and it is a short walk from the subway station. We found it very well stocked with all natural pantry staples and toiletries. Dani is very organized and provides a binder full of restaurant and takeout menus as well as a ton of visitors guides to places around the city. She was very attentive and friendly and I hope to stay there again on my next trip to Brooklyn.[QWERTY123]Wonderful accomodations!  We were warmly welcomed and loved the space to relax after a busy day + fix our own meals!  Quiet residential area, easy access to the subway or cab whichever you prefer!

We plan to recommend it to other friends who may travel to NY!

[QWERTY123]We loved staying with Dani and her family. Dani had great integrity and the rooms were just as we'd hoped, even better. Dani met us at the door when we arrived late (11:30ish) and allowed us to keep our many bags in her hallway instead of lugging the ones we didn't need up the stairs. We had a lot of stuff because we were moving our daughters into college. We had just enough space with my husband and I staying in the nook and our daughters sleeping on the bed couch. Perfect! The kitchen and bathroom were well stocked and our every need was taken care of--Dani even put out a plate of wrapped chocolates. Brooklyn was very convenient and the parking wasn't bad at all. I highly recommend staying here.[QWERTY123]We couldn't recommend the Green Guest House more enthusiastically. Dani and her family are lovely, welcoming people; the apartment is clean, charming and comfortable; and Park Slope is a great neighborhood. It's an easy three block walk to the subway and a quick trip to Manhattan, but there are loads of good restaurants, bars and shops in the neighborhood and Prospect Park has so much to offer. The Brooklyn Museum and Brooklyn Botanic Garden are within walking distance, and the Harmony Playground on the near edge of the park kept our kids entertained for more than an hour. Our only regret is that we left Brooklyn early due to the pending hurricane, but we'll be back the first chance we get. Thanks Dani![QWERTY123]Dani was great to work with! 
We actually never had our stay due to flight cancellations as a  result of hurricane Irene. Dani was very helpful with information before our trip, and very flexible and willing to work with us due to the hassle of our trip falling apart.
I lok forward to the opportunity to actually meet her and stay there on my next visit to NY.[QWERTY123]Dani was an AWESOME hostess! The apartment was spacious, sparkly clean and fresh without a hint of chemical smell! We (my husband and I) drove in for a quick getaway from the kids (we were visiting my family in NY from MI) and were able to find parking easliy and the train was 3-5 min. walk when we were ready to explore. There were several great restaurants near by and a grocery store in case you prefer to cook. The bed was very comfortable and we enjoyed sleeping in and then waking to the sweet calling of 'mommy' and 'daddy' by Dani's adorable son that we didn't have to answer:) We would definately stay here again!!....great location/accomodations, great family  (again, can't say enough about Dani's hospitality) and super attention to detail in apartment amenities![QWERTY123]I had the most amazing, true NY experience in Dani's Park Slope Green Guest House! Not only was it conveniently located to all of the restaurants, bars, and shops along 5th Ave and more in Brooklyn, it was a great place to hang out after a long day in the city - and believe me, it was really easy to get there after a long day in the city too (right to the 4th Ave stop only 3 short blocks away!)

It took some convincing to get my boyfriend and our two friends to stay in an airbnb.com place versus a hotel in downtown Manhattan - but we all couldn't be happier about our stay. The apartment was perfectly quaint and Dani was so helpful in giving our foreign friends some help in where to go, what to see and how to get there. Our biggest regret is that we couldn't stay longer.[QWERTY123]Dani's place is lovely!  It was clean, quiet and felt totally like home.  The neighborhood is residential, which was perfect.  Also, this apartment was HUGE relative to what I've heard about New York apartments and what I've seen from New York hotels.  The kitchen was large by any apartment standards, let alone New York.  

Dani was a wonderful host, offering assistance, providing local menus and maps in the apartment, and willing to change my arrival time at the last minute when I had a conflict.  

I felt safe in the neighborhood and appreciated the lack noise/light pollution you get in Manhattan.  

The apartment is about a 5-minute walk to the train which made my commute to the office very easy.  

Would stay here again in a heartbeat and have already recommended it to my friends![QWERTY123]I really enjoyed my stay at Dani's Park Slope green guest house, and recommend it to all.[QWERTY123]We very much enjoyed our stay at Dani Liebling’s place. The flat was very comfortable, pleasant, quiet and well equipped. A subway station is very near. Dani is a wonderful host, kind and very helpful. We recommend her place and if we were to come again to New York we would definitely stay there again

Avital & Idan[QWERTY123]Dany, for us, it was  a gorgeous stay in Park Slope, Brooklyn. We found a beautiful flat and a great hospitality. The rooms were friendly arranged, clean and calm and very comfortable. A very short way to the next Metro station was also very pleaseant.Thanks a lot.
On our next visit in New York we will surely come back.
All the best, Christoph, Margret and Philipp[QWERTY123]This is a very clean and comfortable place to stay for a couple; it is exceptionally quiet because it faces the back of the building.  The location is terrific, with lots of restaurants, coffee shops, and people watching.  Even though Dani had to be away during our stay, she checked in with us to make sure all of needs were met and left phone numbers to contact her with any questions.  We were especially impressed with all the immaculately clean appliances in the kitchen, spacious dressed (very unusual in our experience), multiple hooks in the bathroom for towels, and other really nice amenities, including a working Apple computer.  We would definitely stay there again.  If you are parking in the area, be sure to read the street cleaning signs for each side of the street to avoid a parking ticket.[QWERTY123]Dani was a fantastic host - warm, helpful, and made everything easy. The apartment is great for a couple or a couple with a baby. It's clean, in a great location, and has a lot of little perks (coffee in the freezer! nice soap!). Highly recommended.[QWERTY123]Dani and her family were fantastic hosts.  The self contained apartment was clean, had all the amenities including kitchen, cable tv internet access, and a very comfortable bed.  When our daughter got sick she even directed us to the nearby hospital.  The location is great if you like to live out but near enough to Manhattan - it's close to shops, transport, eateries and medical facilities (thank goodness).  The area is also family friendly.  We would certainly stay with Dani again if we ever come back to NYC.[QWERTY123]We needed a place to stay for a week while we visited our son and his wife.  Luckily, we found Dani and her sweet family... only a block from where our son lives!  The small apartment they offered us was spotless and had absolutely EVERYTHING we needed for a very enjoyable stay.  Spacious, well-equipped, comfortable furniture, and cozy bed!  We will for SURE repeat our stay with Dani on our next visit!!

Jerry and Barbara Murry
Coarsegold, CA[QWERTY123]We spent a lovely 5 nights at the Park Slope Green Guest House. A great location in Park Slope with easy walking to shopping, restaurants, cafes, Prospect Park and the subway. Thoughtful attention to detail, timely responses to questions and a warm welcome characterized our stay. As a coffee lover, I especially appreciated the range of coffees left for our use in the apartment and the various ways of making coffee that were available.  Dani made our stay feel like a family affair. Thanks![QWERTY123]Dani and her family were so wonderful! The apartment was beautiful, clean, and cozy.  Located in a womderful neighhborhood and close to the mta.  Definitely worth the return.  Thanks again for a wonderful time![QWERTY123]We had a wonderful time staying at Dani's guest house!  It was clean, comfortable and in a nice area!  It is very easy to get around using the subway.  We would come back again and again!  :)[QWERTY123]We stayed the week before Christmas. It was out 1st visit to NYC .My husband  and I and our 2 girls. We fell in love with the quaint setting and red door when we saw it  and just minutes after arriving Dani met us to show us around. She was delightful, and so helpful. I felt especially comfortable since she had a son close in age to our girls and even offered us the stroller for our trips downtown which was a  LIFESAVER for the 3 year old!
The location could not have been better. We actually preferred it. Such a perfect location to hop on the subway and head into Manhattan or Central Park for the day or stay close and enjoy the parks and quiet strolls in Park Slope and Prospect. The area is beautiful!
The apartment was spacious and so cozy. Oh the towels..were sooo soft! And soaps were amazing! (I appreciate little things like this)The bed so soft and the kitchen a dream! Dani also provided organic coffee along with a mini coffee bar ( I called it) with several brewing options.  and this was something I looked forward to each morning. Some Little things I really appreciated were  filtered water, notepads by the computer and impromptu greetings as we arrived and left the apartment. We are already planning a return visit and we will stay here for sure!

Blessed beyond measure![QWERTY123]We were lucky enough to have a whole month's holiday in New York, staying in the lovely apartment which is part of Dani's four story brownstone. Dani and her husband James, were incredibly welcoming and accomodating. Nothing was too much trouble.
The apartment itself occupies part of the first floor, so there's just one small set of steps up to it. Everything was as it appears in the photos - super clean, shining and comfortable, with great natural light.  Clean sheets and towels appeared regularly, and the cleaning lady came twice.There's a great stock of different herbal teas, and organic coffee is in the freezer. If you want to cook, the stove is better than the one we have at home, there was a good range of spices, and things like glad-wrap etc were in the cupboards.
As for getting into Manhattan, the subway is 6-7 mins walk away, and you have a choice of two lines, F or R. We found it was quickest to take the R train to Atlantic Pacific or DeKalb, and then change to an express train. (There's an MTA app which will tell you the quickest way to get from A to B. If you're carrying an i-pad it's fantastic. There's also a computer with internet connection in the apartment for planning ahead of time.) We were out a lot at night, and found the subway well patronised and very safe. (We also bought a monthly Metro Card, which made life very easy!) It took between 20 and 45 mins to get in to Manhattan, depending on where we were going. 
We had a wonderful time, and part of that was due to the welcome we received from Dani and James. The apartment, which is in a very nice neighbourhood, felt like our second home. I also had a number of questions before we left Australia, and Dani got back to me promptly, with helpful replies. In short, we were delighted with our accomodation. Dani says she's pretty busy - it's not hard to see why![QWERTY123]Park Slope Green Guest House is in a great location, close to the subway to go wherever you want and also in the middle of a vibrant neighborhood, so you really don't need to go far if you want great food or interesting shops.  The place itself was clean, attractive, and very comfortable, full of little extras like soft towels and good coffee.  Danni was a gracious host who was very flexible about check in and check out times.  All in all a great experience.  Highly recommended.[QWERTY123]Dani was a great host! She gave us a warm welcome, and was very accommodating of our needs, given that we were traveling with our infant daughter.

The apartment was clean and comfy, and definitely an excellent location for visiting the NYC area. Dani recommended some great restaurants, and helped us find our way around the neighborhood.

I'd recommend this little 1 bedroom unit in Park Slope to anyone looking for a quick getaway in the Big Apple.[QWERTY123]Gorgeous place, convenient location.  Dani was a great host and I loved staying here. :)[QWERTY123]This was the perfect apartment for our short stay - clean, cozy, with all the amenities we needed and super convenient to get to Manhattan. I used to live in NY but never spent much time in Brooklyn. I'm glad I got to do so this time. Dani was a gracious host, getting to and out of the apartment was convenient. Overall a fantastic stay![QWERTY123]The host is always warm and welcoming. The place itself is kept immaculately and is in a nice neighborhood.[QWERTY123]We stayed at Dani's Park Slope Green Guest House in Brooklyn for 1 week in February and had an amazing experience. Dani is the consummate host, going out of her way to make sure we felt at home and had everything we needed. This included leaving detailed notes regarding children's programs nearby, offering to help get us guest passes at the YMCA, and recommending an incredible photo exhibit. The guest house is very clean, comfortable and located in a truly interesting neighborhood in Brooklyn. There is a subway station close by, Prospect Park is within walking distance and a wide range of nearby ethnic restaurants kept our appetites satisfied. We hope to stay at Dani's again on our next trip to New York.[QWERTY123]If you are looking for a quiet, clean, spacious, comfortable, conveniently located accommodations on Brooklyn's Park Slope, this is your place.[QWERTY123]The best of both worlds - the bright spacious interior with large windows with views of multiple gardens has a peaceful feel that seems very far from the frenzy of the city. Yet within literally minutes one can be on a train and heading, in just a few stops, to the liveliest places in NYC. 

Combined with Dani's warm welcome and helpful answers to any practical questions, what more could one ask for as a base for a great New York experience?[QWERTY123]My daughter and I just spent the most amazing week in New York and are still reeling from the experience. What an unforgettable trip. Staying in the lovely apartment in Dani and her family's home was the perfect choice for us. It had everything we were looking for - comfort, convenience, great location, all the amenities - and more - birds chirping in the morning, neighbours chatting on their stoops, cherry trees in blossom. Dani is just the kind of host you want to find - knowledgeable, helpful, generous and not overbearing. If (when!) we return to NY, this will definitely be our home away from home again.[QWERTY123]Dani and the apartment were fantastic. I read the great reviews before renting and they are all true. Great neighborhood. Lots of restaurants in easy walking distane. Dani's recommedations were right on target. We wanted to buy flowers and she could suggest 3 places. The apartment wa (Website hidden by Airbnb) 	very clean. It had everything, coffee teas, great shampoo and lotions. We will return.[QWERTY123]The guest house is comfortable, clean, and affordable. The Park Slope location is great in its own right for exploring Brooklyn and there are many nearby subways for venturing into Manhattan. 

Dani was very responsive and was able to schedule us for a last-minute weekend in NYC. She is also a very helpful and kind hostess.[QWERTY123]We just returned from a trip to first NY and then at friends in Toronto. We brought a 9 months baby and were quite new to NY and especially Brooklyn. But Dani helped us having a wonderful time there! She and her little family lives just downstairs from the nice and quiet(!) apartment and we felt really safe asking about anything by the door, the phone or by mail – anytime! Where to eat quickly, slow... where to get medical help, alternative as conventional, where to shop eco food etc. Dani and her family are environment friendly in as many ways they can be and we felt really good about that. The sub is just around the corner from Green Guest House – Manhattan is 15-20 min away ; D[QWERTY123]Notre séjour chez Dani nous a pleinement satisfaits.
L'appartement, bien clair et dans un quartier calme nous a permis de bien nous reposer de nos journées à Manhattan. Il est très bien équipé, et nous avions notamment tout ce qu'il fallait pour se faire du bon thé et du bon café (bio).
De plus Parkslope est un  quartier agréable où l'on trouve tout ce qu'il faut pour faire des courses, mais aussi des restaurants, des bars et des cafés sympas.
Dani et son compagnon ont été très accueillants, très sympathiques.
Nous recommandons sans problème leur appartement.[QWERTY123]Dani's place fit the bill perfectly. Very well furnished - beyond expectations. Great location. Very private set up. Dani is a gracious host. A really great value and a nice find in Brooklyn. We'll be back and recommend it to others.[QWERTY123]Dani's apartment is lovely and has the turn of the century charm you won't see in most hotels.  The bed was so comfortable and we appreciated Dani's effort to support a ""green"" experience.  The train is close and the neighborhood is very walkable and enjoyable.  There are restaurants, shops, grocery stores and parks within walking distance to make for a great locale.  Brooklyn's Old Stone House is nearby and warrants a visit.  Dani is available for questions and assistance, if needed.  This was a great location to support our exploration of Brooklyn and Manhattan.  We highly recommend Park Slope Green Guest House![QWERTY123]Absolutely fantastic host and accommodation!! The apartment is super-clean and equipped with everything. And Dani is sooo nice. Should you need anything, she is there to help and guide you.
Besides, staying at Dani's place in Brooklyn is a very practical solution to be in NY but not spend the excessive amounts of money for which they charge you in Manhattan. Dani's Green Guest House is close to transportation and well connected to Manhattan. You will not find a better place at a better price. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED![QWERTY123]It's the best green guest house ever to me. I was staying there with my sister and her son. She is allergic to many things but she was so fine staying at Dani's house. I was very happy to be able to show her how important our living environment was, and she finally believed what I was trying to tell her before. Beside their ""GREEN HOUSE"", Dani is a helpful and wonderful mom, and I felt very comfortable to stay at her house. I definitely will stay again when my family comes next time. Train station is very close. It only take 15 minutes to NYC. Price is very reasonable.[QWERTY123]We had a fantastic time at Dani's place in Brooklyn. It is perfectly situated in the beautiful neighbourhood of Park Slope, very close to several subway stations. There are tons of great restaurants & bars in the area, and Prospect Park is only a couple of blocks away.
Dani was a great host and gave us lots of useful tips. The apartment was clean, bright and we felt right at home. A perfect vacation![QWERTY123]The Park Slope Green Guest House provided the perfect base for our stay, and Dani was a great host, from the first email, through to our departure. Well-equipped with everything we needed i would definitely recommend this rental.[QWERTY123]My wife and 2 young kids had a great stay at Dani's for 5 nights.  Dani is a welcoming, helpful, accommodating, and warm host.  The apartment was everything we needed for a home away from home.   It was very clean and we were glad to have a well-equipped kitchen and internet access.  All necessities were just around the corner.  Park Slope--wonderful neighborhood.[QWERTY123]I visited my daughter and son-in-law in Park Slope to celebrate her graduation from Pratt's MID program, but their place is postage-stamp sized so I stayed for 5 nights with Dani. I am chemically sensitive and often have difficulty traveling due to the cleaning products, scented products, offgassing furniture and carpet and so on in hotels. Dani's apartment was paradise for me: I even slept well without taking any meds - which almost never is the case when I am away from home. The apt. is charming, comfortable and convenient to everything. Dani and her family are as nice as they can be. I so much appreciate the effort they have put into creating a nontoxic, healthy home in the middle of the city!![QWERTY123]Fantastic apartment near all the fun in Park Slope. Super clean, and Dani and her husband were super friendly and helpful for my parents who stayed here (we stayed several blocks away) and hadn't been to NY in over 30 years. The kitchen came fully stocked (with food and beverages!), and there were plenty of towels, and the sitting area was perfect for them to enjoy coffee and breakfast before heading out to slog around the city with us. Definitely would recommend staying here for couples who want a decent amount of space for a really affordable price in a great neighborhood![QWERTY123]We had a lovely stay in Park Slope.  Dani is very friendly and easy to work with.  We had a seamless stay with smooth arrival and departure.  She lent us some of her personal belongings to make our stay with our children more comfortable.  Very nice extras: chocolates, products in the bathroom, coffee, and computer w/ internet!  Highly recommend this apartment and its great location![QWERTY123]This was our first time booking through Airbnb and we're converts now after the wonderfully welcoming experience we had staying at the Park Slope Green Guest House. 
We arrived mid-morning and Dani welcomed us into her home with a huge smile. Upon our return later that day, the Guest House was immaculate and we felt very much at home. Our daughter (8 months) had just started crawling and there was lots of open space for her to explore. 

The extras (internet, stocked kitchen, and toiletries) made our stay super easy and Dani helpfully let us know where we could pick up diapers as well as a great breakfast spot. (Green Kitchen) When we accidently locked our stroller in the home after leaving, Dani was easy to reach by phone, despite being out of state and a fellow Airbnb host quickly came to rescue us. 

Dani's place is located close to the subway and within walking distance to Prospect Park. We frequented Cafe Regular just around the corner each day for excellent Americanos & Cafe au Lait in a Parisian setting. 

We had an excellent stay and kept saying how happy we were to have booked Dani's place over a hotel. There is something so relaxing and comforting about staying in a home when traveling. 

Thanks Dani for making our first family trip so comfortable![QWERTY123]Dani's apartment is just what we needed.  She is very convenient to the subway and walking distance to many good restaurants.  Her kitchen is wonderful!  Dani provides needed information and her apartment provides  privacy.  I would definitely recommend her and hopefully we will get the opportunity to stay here again!  Thank you Dani.
CS[QWERTY123]This has to be one of the best places that I have ever stayed at via airbnb.  The apartment was a great size for the two of us, and was incredibly clean.  It had everything we needed, including great all-natural bath products and even a computer, which came in very handy.  The apartment was also convenient to the subway, and we were able to get into the city very quickly.

Dani and her family are very nice people.  Definitely worth a stay (Website hidden by Airbnb)[QWERTY123]Dani was great and very friendly, the apartment had everything we need for a comfortable stay.
Thanks!![QWERTY123]This was our first Airbnb experience. We came to Brooklyn for a friend's wedding. This location was ideal for us- close to the subway, fun places to eat nearby, and a nice neighborhood. The place was perfect size for the 2 of us and well stocked with everything we could have needed. Having the computer in the room was very helpful! We would definitely stay here again![QWERTY123]Dani's house was a wonderful place to stay.  Her family is warm and generous and helpful, making me feel very much at home.  The apartment was professionally cleaned, and the bed very comfortable.  It makes me wish I had more opportunities to visit Brooklyn![QWERTY123]My husband, baby, and I stayed in Dani's guest house for two nights.  Dani was extremely easy to communicate with and responded quickly to all of my emails.  We had a complicated schedule (arrived late and departed late) and Dani was wonderfully flexible and easy-going. She greeted us when we arrived, even though it was really late, and showed us the apartment.

The place was just as it is described... Very clean, roomy, bright, and well organized.  Dani goes out of the way to make you feel comfortable and provides lots of information on the neighborhood and various attractions of the city.  The location was close to many eateries, Prospect Park, and the subway station.

We would definitely stay here again when we are in town.


[QWERTY123]Thanks to Dani and her family for being such great hosts during our trip to New York! The apartment was great and had everything we needed. It was also in a great location - close to restaurants, food markets, and a short walk to the subway. Dani was very friendly and available if we had any questions. I highly recommend this apartment.[QWERTY123]Dani and her place were wonderful!  She was so very welcoming to us and made us feel right at home.  The neighborhood was great, easy access to subways and Dani provided a 3 ring binder with menus from near by restaurants.  My sons really enjoyed that so they could pick the spots.  The apartment was very nicely done, extremely clean, and comfy beds!  Highly recommended![QWERTY123]T
This holiday was my first experience with Airbnb and what a great experience it was. The apartment at Park Slope was a delight to live in  and we felt very much at home. A very well equipped kitchen which was well stocked with many many extras ( lovely organic chocolate)  there was a good supply of toiletries in the bathroom which had a wonderfully powerful shower. A ten minute walk from Prospect park the Brooklyn museum, and the subway.Great shops nearby selling a lots of organic produce. The neighbourhood was quiet and the people were so very friendly. Dani and her family were on there own holiday for part of the time we were there but made sure we had lots of phone numbers if we needed any information or help. Although on holiday James came back to Park Slope and welcomed us making sure we had all the information we needed. James is a lovely man, friendly, helpful with a beautiful smile. I met Dani about five days before we left for home, she is such a special lady, we had some lovely blethers( a Scottish word for chats ) a very gentle friendly woman who was a pleasure to be around.
I would highly recommend staying at Park Slope you wont be disappointed. I would return in a heartbeat.  Margaret :)[QWERTY123]Dani was an amazing host!  She was always very responsive, both before and during our trip.  The space was exactly as it showed in her photos, very clean and cozy.  We loved that she provided us maps and brochures of the city, as well as a big binder full of restaurant menus and recommendations.  The location was also wonderful, as it was really close to several shops, restaurants, Prospect Park and the subway.

We would definitely stay there again![QWERTY123]We stayed at The Park Slope Green Guest House in Brooklyn for 3 days and loved both the area and the apartment. Dani and her husband were extremely nice and helpful. The flat was clean and cosy and we would happily stay there again should we go back to New York. Easy recommendation![QWERTY123]We were lucky enough to discover Dani's place in Brooklyn's Park Slope when looking for somewhere to stay close to our son's apartment just down the street!  It was a great find!  Not only was it only a block from our son's, it is also in a nice neighborhood and close to lots of neighborhood shops and restaurants.  The apartment was clean and neat and had everything we needed for our 3 night stay. The only thing I wished it had is WiFi.  It DOES have a very nice wired Mac Desktop that works great, but I did miss using my own laptop sitting on the couch or the bed.  But overall, it was a wonderfully convenient place to stay and only a block from a subway station. We traveled into NYC 2 different days.  Parking near the apartment can be iffy, but we lucked out on the first day with a parking place right in front of the building. We didn't move the car for the 3 days we were there!
Thanks, Dani.[QWERTY123]Dani had over 90 five star reviews when we booked and I have no hesitation in leaving another!

Dani was a perfect host who helped us with all our queries and was very accommodating with our schedule. The apartment was well stocked with everything you'd need and was spotlessly clean when we arrived.

Park Slope is a great neighbourhood and a great base to visit Brooklyn and the other boroughs in NYC.
[QWERTY123]Our first experience with airbnb was a good one.  We liked dealing online with a company to handle charges as well as communicating with the host for specific information.  The apartment was convenient to Prospect Park, local restaurants, the Brooklyn Museum of Art.  Hostess provided subway directions from Manhattan--easy walk to the apartment--and let us leave bags so we could begin our Brooklyn touring before check-in.
[QWERTY123]there's a reason dani's got so many great reviews--she's got a fantastic apartment and is a terrific host to boot!

as you can probably tell from the photos, the place is immaculate. what might be harder to ascertain is just how relaxing and comfortable a space it really is. bright, spacious, well-equipped and (Website hidden by Airbnb) a real find in a city like new york.

dani was responsive, flexible, gracious and welcoming throughout the entire reservation process and during our stay. while the apartment is a separate unit in her home, she was always available for any questions or assistance.

park slope is an adorable neighborhood and a welcome respite from the over-stimulation of manhattan. being so close to so many great restaurants, markets, shops and the park should sell you on this place if nothing else has.

if you want to make sure your time in new york has as much relaxation as it does fun, i can't recommend dani's apartment enough![QWERTY123]We loved our stay at the Park Slope Green Guest House.  It was perfect for my husband and me, plus our daughter and her infant.  The kitchen was well-supplied and convenient, the computer was so handy (with an infant, we did have to order up car service a few times), the location was great.  This was our first trip ever to Brooklyn, and we loved being able to get around the borough so easily from our little ""home.""  Dani was always helpful and full of good advice about the neighborhood, and at the same time, she respected our privacy.  It was a beautiful wedding, and a beautiful weekend.  We are glad we chose Park Slope Green Guest House for our lodging.[QWERTY123]Dani is a wonderful and gracious host. We actually weathered out Hurricane Sandy with her. We never lost power, the HBO on demand service kept us entertained during the storm, and Dani supplied us with homemade soup. 
 
We love the NY Subway and the apt is located within a 5 min. walk from the station with the F and R trains that go to Manhattan making it a very convenient location for using public transportation. There is also the G train for a ride to trendy Williamsburg. Park Slope is a picturesque neighborhood and the apartment is located a half a block from 5th Avenue and a block and a half from 7th Avenue. Both streets are booming with stores, restaurants, banks, grocery stores, anything you could possibly need. Dani has a lot of info in the apt about restaurants, car services, maps that were most helpful to us to make our stay in Brooklyn wonderful.
 
There is a great reflexology office down the block on the corner of 12th St. and it was a great relief after walking city streets. Restaurants are plentiful, the Brooklyn Museum and Prospect Park a walk able distance, and a local car service is reliable and great value. When it comes to the apartment, the bed was extremely comfortable. Initially I thought I'd miss WIFI but doing searches and answering emails on the Mac computer was easier than using a tablet or smartphone.  Dani's commitment to a Green home environment was appreciated. 
 
[QWERTY123]Our stay at Dani's couldn't have been a better experience.   The location was perfect for our visit and considering Hurricane Sandy hit just before arrival we felt Dani and her family's kind hospitality made the stay that much more comfortable.   There was plenty of room to spread out and and  even have a son or two visit a couple of nights!  My husband and I know that if we are in Brooklyn again we will look up Dani's Park Slope Green Guest House.[QWERTY123]It was joy to stay at the Green Guest House. It was an attractive space. Fully green and full of tasteful personal touches and felt like home! Dani had given a lot of thought as to what a quest might need. The bed was very comfortable and there was great peace and quiet. Dani was a perfect host and so warm and helpful and all around pleasant to deal with. You couldn't do better! I am looking forward to staying here again.[QWERTY123]The green guest house is a beautiful and welcoming space.  Dani and her family are accessible and kind. We appreciated the kid friendly set up.  It is conveniently located near great parks and restaurants. The kitchen is equipped and user friendly.[QWERTY123]Dani is a fantastic host! She even let us check in early! The apartment is  perfect and within walking distance of our son's  Park Slope apt. The place is very clean,  quiet, cozy, and  well stocked. Dani is extremely kind and helpful, and available to answer any concerns or questions. We would most definitely stay in this beautiful apartment again![QWERTY123]My second stay at Dani's place was just as great as the first. So much more comfortable and home-y than a hotel, and in a great neighborhood. Dani was very flexible with my arrival time and recommended a great Peruvian place nearby for dinner. Hope to stay here again when work or travels take me back to NYC.[QWERTY123]Our stay at Dani's  was excellent.  The apartment was pristine, quiet,  and well equipped.  Dani was very buttoned up, a good communicator, and quick to offer us any help we needed.  We would be very happy to return here.[QWERTY123]Perfect for our Apartment remodel requiring a home away from home. Thank you Dani![QWERTY123]Dani's place was an absolute delight. I had booked the apartment for my parents, who were visiting us in New York. If you ever had to find accommodation for your mother because your own home is just too small, you know that you can become very picky. ;)

The ""Green Guest House"" is perfectly situated, right in the middle of Park Slope, very well connected to the subway, and the 2nd floor apartment was also very spacious with everything you can possibly need. My parents fully enjoyed their stay (which means a lot, actually!) and already said they wanted to go there again for their next visit.[QWERTY123]I had a wonderful experience during my recent stay at Dani’s rental apartment in Park Slope, Brooklyn.  Dani was very nice and willing to help make my stay as comfortable and carefree as possible.  The apartment was fully equipped, which made it very easy to make myself at home.  The location was perfect for me with restaurants, stores, and subway station all within a few minutes walk.  I would definitely recommend Dani’s rental to anyone that needs a comfortable and affordable place to stay in Brooklyn. :)  Bill Liberto[QWERTY123]The apartment is very, very comfortable and has a ""homey"" feeling.  It is very roomy and nicely decorated.  The best part of my visit to NY, aside from being with family, was coming home.  Dani made us feel welcome and was readily available to answer any questions.  The location could not be any better!  4 blocks away from the subway station, one block away from great restaurants, bars and shopping.  I would definitely recommend this place if you want the homey feeling and the convenience of being minutes away from the city.  No need to go to the city, explore the surrounding area, you will be pleasantly surprised.  This is definitely on my list for NY, would not stay in any other place![QWERTY123]Dani was a very accommodating host. She let us check into her place a bit earlier as our flight time changed, had a well stocked refrigerator and gave useful suggestions about places to visit depending on the weather.

Her place is close to the train station and that is an added bonus. We were glad that we chose her place to stay during our trip.[QWERTY123]Dani was a delight to deal with and her apartment was comfortable, clean, and exceedingly well furnished.  She's gone the extra mile to anticipate and provide for her guests' needs and her place is filled with small, thoughtful touches designed to brighten your stay.  The basics were also sound, and exactly as depicted in the photos: a ~600 sq. ft. self-contained apartment, furnished kitchen, comfortable bed, shower with good water pressure, etc.

The apartment is right around the corner from so many of Park Slope's terrific restaurants, coffee shops, bars, and other stores.  Dani offers it at an exceptional value to guests, and this was a most fortunate find.  I'll definitely be back.[QWERTY123]the department is phenomenal, the location is perfect, the neightborhood is very safe, and Dani provides an excellent care, she allways on the lookout for the needs you may have.

without doubt, the best place on brookling.[QWERTY123]This was our first Air BnB experience, and it was wonderful. The location was perfect (short wall to the F G Q trains) lots of restaurants and markets nearby.  The kitchen was spacious with everything you can want, and the bedding was very warm and comfortable.  It was wondrously quiet and really just a great experience. If you are deciding between dani and someone else, choose dani.[QWERTY123]Dani and her family were awesome!  Very nice people.  From the moment we arrived, slightly flustered from all the traffic we sat in; Dani was there to welcome and help us with our bags.  
She gave us a quick tour, told us where the subway station was and a recommendation for dinner.  
The apartment was just as pictured.  Very nice and had everything we needed.
I would definitely stay again! 
[QWERTY123]This is a very charming, clean small apartment at the back of the house, over-Iooking back yards. I  stayed here for 5 nights and would re-book the next trip I take to Brooklyn. I feel lucky to have happened upon Dani--she  is a lovely and welcoming host, has lots of information about the area; the house is very close to the F line of the subway, there is a cafe that makes great espresso one block away,on the corner of 12th and 6th Ave. (Sweet Wolf's). I walked to Prospect park and the Brooklyn Museum.  Great place, great host.[QWERTY123]We had a great time in Dani's apartment.  She was a fantastic host and the place was clean and fully stocked with organic products (tea, coffee, shampoo ect.).  She gave us great advice about what to do in Brooklyn and made our stay very enjoyable.  We will definitely return to Park Slope and the Green Guest House![QWERTY123]The Park Slope Green Guest House is comfy, clean, cute and accessible. It was perfect for a couple of days to get away and explore Brooklyn. It was also an easy train ride to Manhattan. (But there is so much going on in Brooklyn...who needs Manhattan? I kid, but I really was blown away with how much the area has changed.) You literally bring your stuff to the Park Slope Green Guest House and are set. Dani is simply fantastic! You feel good energy with this woman the moment she greets you at the door. I had a wonderful couple of days and when I need a getaway like this in the future, I will hope Dani's place is available![QWERTY123]I reserved Dani's place for my parents, and it was easily the best place they've stayed while visiting Park Slope. Impeccably clean, spacious, and quiet- with lots of amenities in the kitchen and bathroom. Arranging everything with Dani could not of been easier![QWERTY123]This is a very pleasant apartment, with a nice kitchen and a comfy bed. It's a five minute walk to the 4th ave subway, with convenient connections to Manhattan and other parts of Brooklyn. Dani was great, very communicative  and friendly. We'd definitely stay there again. Nerds take note: there's a networked computer but no wifi.[QWERTY123]Hi, Dani is great and disponible. She would answer at any question you have or if you need help. The appartment is very charming. The neighborough is nice, a lot of shop, pub and restaurant. Brooklyn is the place to be ![QWERTY123]Staying at the green guest house of Dani Liebling was just great.  The home is well located in a safe area,  near the subway and convenient to all thatBrooklyn's  Park Slope has to offer.  The apartment is so comfortable, clean,  and cozy .  I'd defiinitely recommend it to any single or couple .[QWERTY123]Dani's Guest House could not be better.  It is clean, well appointed and in a wonderful location.  We have grandchildren within walking distance so it is a perfect spot for us. We will certainly return to Dani's many, many times.  It is a treat.

Just another note.  This apartment is self contained so you have lots of privacy.  It is also quiet!!!!

C and J Walser[QWERTY123]Very clean and comfortable place, with unexpected amenities (food in kitchen and toiletries in bath).  The bed was comfy and it was quiet and lovely to stay there. We love that area of Brooklyn and if you want/need to go to Manhatten then the train station is very close. We got ourselves to the south end of Central Park in 35 minutes!  We will absolutely return as our son now lives nearby and this is clearly a perfect fit for us.[QWERTY123]Dani's studio in Park Slope was everything it promised to be - clean, great upgrades, secure, quiet, perfect location.  I loved getting up in the morning after sleeping on a great bed, making a cup of organic coffee - everything provided including the coffee!  The kitchen was stocked with all sorts of condiments, teas, and anything you would need for cooking.  Which I didn't, since the studio was so close to many charming restaurants, as well as the subway into Manhattan.  You won't go wrong with this choice.[QWERTY123]Dani was incredibly friendly. The apartment was super clean and close to transportation. Couldn't have asked for a better stay.[QWERTY123]We had a great stay at Dani's place. She created a very welcoming atmosphere and was always there to answer questions and give good advice or just for a good chat! The apartment was calm and cosy with everything you need.
Nadja, with husband and son (age 2,5).[QWERTY123]Dani was a very pleasant host. Her place is adorable, and she takes care to make it as green as possible, which isn't always easy. Prospect Park is only a few blocks away and there were plenty of good places for food and coffee in the area, though that part of Park Slope is a little quieter than the northern end. 

I certainly recommend this place, and Dani, to anyone looking to spend some time in New York City, and especially anyone open to exploring a little of Brooklyn![QWERTY123]What a delightful stay.  The apartment was immaculate, and in each and every room there were thoughtful extras - from the toiletries and cabinets in the bathroom that were filled with anything I could have possibly needed to plenty of Kleenex boxes - you could tell someone was anticipating every need.  

The location was perfect, and even though there was street construction going 24/7, I couldn't hear a thing.

I would recommend Dani's place to anyone, and I will certainly stay there the next time I visit Brooklyn.

Thanks so much![QWERTY123]My in-laws who stayed at Dani's were so pleased with the exceptionally clean, comfortable and relaxing apartment in Brooklyn. We had such a pleasant experience in all of our dealings with her and she couldn't have been more welcoming! The kitchen is a bonus with extras left by previous guests of tea, coffee, and snacks in the pantry. My in-laws were able to enjoy their own corner of Park Slope and could walk to fifth avenue shops easily. We were able to relax and hang in the living room with them, too.  We would all recommend Dani's place in a heartbeat. And we certainly appreciate the green aspect, too.[QWERTY123]I stayed at Dani's place for a week with my mom and sister. It's a lovely apartment, well furnished with everything you need, clean and spotless! It's also a block from the metro, which means getting in and out of Manhattan is fast and easy. A great place to visit New York from!

I would definitely go back and fully recommend it.[QWERTY123]It was a really pleasant experience at Park Slope Guesthouse with Dani. The appartment was in perfect shape (huge kitchen), the subway only 2 blocks away and a fantastic host.
We can highly recommend![QWERTY123]Dani was an excellent host & the apartment was comfortable & clean.  We would rent this apartment again anytime.   

MarciaWaterman[QWERTY123]Great host..nice apartment! Living like a true New Yorker! very very clean!  lots of nice touches as extras... Organic coffee... Organic chocolates... Just nice touches....[QWERTY123]This was my first time ever that I tried Airbnb and will definitely do it again - Dani's place is great! Best sleeps I've ever had in Brooklyn - quiet and comfortable. Location is ideal, just a block from the F-train to Manhattan and the 5th Ave with all shops, cafes, bars, restaurants around the corner. My husband had never been to New York before so he was suprised by the size of the apartment, he thought it was small. I - who had stayed in several New York apartments before - thought it was a palace :-), plenty of space for 2 people. At the time when I made my decision about reserving accomodation and read all the reviews by other guests, I was convinced by one saying that if you are thinking between Dani and someone else, choose Dani. I say the same now - choose Dani! Dani and her family made us feel homey and were very helpful and available had we needed anything. A great experience and we will definitely return![QWERTY123]Dani and her family were perfect, gracious hosts. The apt was beautiful, immaculate and comfortable. My daughter and I had a great stay and would rent the apt again in a heart beat! 

The neighborhood was close to everything - stores, restaurants, the park and the subway. Thanks, Dani![QWERTY123]Dani was a very nice host: very uncomplicated and very communicative and quick! Her apartment was great! It was very well equipped, very clean and huge! There had been coffee beans with which we could prepare delicious coffee ;-) We could bring our luggage earlier than the check-in time and left it there for some hours after check-out – very comfortable! Brooklyn is a nice area – absolutely worth seeing it. And kind of a good alternative for Manhattan: We sent the days in Big apple and the evenings (diner and bars) in Brooklyn, just around the corner from Danis apartment. Two subway stations just very close (3min walk) quickly took us to NYC – very cool! I would love to stay at Dani's again! Thank you![QWERTY123]I can see why Dani has SUPER HOST Status.. Wow!! She was absolutely wonderful. We loved our stay at her guest suite. The apartment is very clean and spacious. Very classic New York / Brooklyn. Beautiful hard wood floors and a clean modern kitchen. The house is very well stocked with everythng you could possibly think of. My son slept on the sofa bed and it seemed to be pretty comfortable. The queen bed was pretty comfortable as well. 

The location is good as well. Very close to the subway station and just a short ride to Manhattan. Although, there are great things to see in Brooklyn as well..Prospect Park, Williamsburg...

Spectacular city...wonderful apartment...gracious host!
[QWERTY123]Awesome! Thanks Dani! This comfy and spotless apartment has given us what we needed. Besides the normal facilities that the apartment has, the tv and the computer has given us a really good week. About supermakets and more... Dani´s house is quite close from everything. This apartment is close from 5th avenue and it is about 6-7 minutes walking to R station that takes you to Manhattan in about 30 minutes. The apartment is quite convinient for two people. More than 2 people (4 people) this apartment is also good but not for more than one week because the pull out sofa is not confortable at all. Apart from that, Dani is a great host and her family is cool.[QWERTY123]Very well-maintained, with all amenities, very friendly and helpful host! On a beautiful block in the center of Park Slope.
Highly recommend![QWERTY123]Très bon accueil,appartement correspondant à l'annonce et hôte très disponible[QWERTY123]Dani and her family were so welcoming and the apartment was spotless. I felt like it was a home away from home as soon as I arrived. It's a great place in a lovely neighbourhood and I would definitely recommend it to anyone going to Brooklyn![QWERTY123]This was my second stay in Dani's apartment and it was every bit as good as the first.  Great host, great space, and great neighborhood.  I look forward to returning.[QWERTY123]Our stay at the Park Slope Green Guest House was wonderful. The neighbourhood has a safe, community feel and was within walking distance to many amenities. 

The guest house itself was clean and bright with a cosy, lived-in atmosphere. We really appreciated the small touches like a full directory of takeout menus, most with feedback from Dani and use of the kitchen pantry. 

I would definitely not hesitate to book again if we're back in NYC! Thanks for making our stay memorable.[QWERTY123]Very nice flat, very clean, very good situation, very nice welcome with James. Just as we expected ! We spent a very good week in Dani's and James' flat.[QWERTY123]According to Airbnb there are over 1,000 whole apartment/condo rentals available in Brooklyn.  How could it be possible that we were lucky enough to get the cream of the crop?  We cannot find anything to say that has not already been stated again & again on previous posts.  Not a single post is an exaggeration.  It is true - Dani has thought of everything - literally.  Often times people entertain the thought of going green, organic & earth friendly.  Unfortunately it costs a great deal to do so and thus many talk about it but never quite make the complete leap.....when Dani states her apartment is Green she doesn't mean maybe.  This delightful apartment is as Green as an apartment can get in a vintage building.  From the high quality coffee, toiletries, cleaning products, air filter, water filters in both kitchen & shower......the apartment was spotless and well stocked.  Located less than 5 minutes from the F Train - a very safe 
neighborhood.  A great grocery store 1/2 block away on 5th for extra grocery items - and just another block & 1/2  on 5th you will find Peppino's Brick Oven Pizza.  No need to go to Grimaldi's - Peppinos pizza is fabulous - as well as all of their Italian food, check them out on Yelp.  My husband was at first dubious but in an instant became a firm believer so much so that he is not interested in looking for something new when we return.   Dani's apartment is a true home.  We felt as though we were part of the neighborhood - got us to dreaming that perhaps one day......Thanks so very much Dani for allowing us to be temporary tenants in your delightful little Brooklyn nest:)[QWERTY123]We had a wonderful time at this eco- friendly apartment! It was big, the bed was comfortable, very clean, the neighborhood was awesome (supermarket, farmers market on sunday, subway, shopping, restaurants all close by) and Dani and her family were great hosts. Dani is very helpful, provided a lot of information & it was always fun chatting with her. Also the small touches like mini organic chocolates and the organic coffee or the pantry were part of this great experience![QWERTY123]Really a great experience in a great apartment. Dani is wonderful! Prompt, very sweet, and helpful. We felt totally looked after yet absolutely undisturbed. The apartment is immaculate, full of light, and totally turned out with little things that show how much thought Dani has given to making her guests comfortable. Great Brooklyn location and you can F-train to Manhattan from a couple blocks away in minutes. Enthusiastic thumbs up! Thank you Dani![QWERTY123]My friends traveled from across the world to stay at Dani's apartment and they could not have been happier with their experience. The place was quaint and perfect for two people exploring Brooklyn for the first time. My friends loved the whole vibe and enjoyed the neighborhood which is both laid back and not touristy at all. Dani went above and beyond to accommodate them, provided area recommendations and was a friendly face around the house. Thank you so much![QWERTY123]We had a great time. I can totally recommend this place.[QWERTY123]Our stay at the Park Slope Green Guest House was perfect in every detail. The apartment has every amenity and convenience, from a very comfortable bed to a fully equipped kitchen. It is ideally situated for visiting and enjoying Brooklyn, and is close to the F Train for trips to Manhattan. Dani is a warm and conscientious hostess. We would like to stay at  Dani's whenever we visit New York and recommend her apartment enthusiastically and wholeheartedly.[QWERTY123]This is a great base to explore Park Slope.  It was clean and quiet.  Dani gave some great advice and we were off.  We would recommend Dani's place![QWERTY123]This was such a pleasant surprise for my meticulous husband. But I knew, in prior conversations with Dani that all would be well.The apartment is not only immaculate, it is also very comfortable and very ""quiet"".  Dani is so accommodating and we wish we had a chance to talk more but we were all busy. We will be back, hopefully. The best of our NYC experiences yet and we have been here many times over the past 6 years. Love Brooklyn![QWERTY123]Returning to this lovely place is probably the most sincere form of endorsement and, fortunately for me, I booked early enough to be able to. 

With so much going for it, it's hard to imagine the Park Slope Green Guest House ever being empty - although everything is so spotless that it looks like you're the first guest![QWERTY123]Dani was a great host, always helpful, and we really enjoyed the stay at her place. 
The apartment was clean and nice and it felt spacious even though we were three people sharing it. 
It was near the subway which was great and there were a lot of restaurants and shops nearby.
Would definitely stay there again![QWERTY123]It added such a nice touch to our stay in Brooklyn to be able to call Dani's guest house home for the long weekend.  The guest house is a lovely space in a great neighborhood and we couldn't have been happier there.  Thanks![QWERTY123]This was our first airbnb experience, and we couldn't have been happier!  The location was ideal for us, right in the heart of Park Slope.  The apartment was neat, clean, and cozy.  There were instructions for the TV and computer, and plenty of info about local restaurants and other attractions.  The next time we visit Brooklyn, we will certainly hope to stay there again![QWERTY123]Great apartment in a great location with great hosts! Highly recommended.[QWERTY123]I'm a return visitor and I think that says it all.  Dani does everything right.[QWERTY123]We really enjoyed our stay at Dani's Park Slope Green Guest House.  The apartment was exactly as advertised.  We found it to be extremely clean and our hosts were warm, friendly people who made us feel welcome. Neighborhood is great with several wonderful little restaurants.   Plan to stay a while and enjoy Brooklyn![QWERTY123]WE had a great time. Really enjoyed the apartment. Very quiet area.
Loved the neighborhood. I wished we stayed longer. There are so many thing to do and see. We will return. :) Thanks Dani :)[QWERTY123]Had a great stay at the Park Slope Green Guest House! Plenty of space, high ceilings, lots of natural light. Awesome location, cute neighborhood, and an easy walk to lots of great bars and restaurants. Our host Dani was very friendly and helpful, she recommended ""Cafe Regular"" for a morning cup of coffee - this little gem is right around the corner and possibly be the best latte I have ever had! We slept 3 adults in this unit. The queen bed was very comfortable, the pull out sofa not as comfortable, but it was sufficient. We didn't cook any meals but the kitchen looked well equipped. I look forward to a return trip![QWERTY123]Terrific experience all around![QWERTY123]Dani is a SUPER HOST in our minds.  We arrived later than we said we would, checked out later than we should have and Dani was sweet and tolerant.  The place is very comfortable, very clean, in a great location close to the subway and quiet.  There was a variety of great coffee to chose from and organic as well.  It was great.  We highly recommended staying with Dani in this great little spot.[QWERTY123]So wie die Wohnung bei arirbnb dargestellt wurde, haben wir sie auch vorgefunden. Die Wohnung bietet alles was man braucht und hat uns voll überzeugt. Bei unserem nächsten New York-Aufenthalt werden wir sie wieder mieten. 

[QWERTY123]This was our first trip to New York and we brought along our 7 year old daughter.  Dani's home was very clean and just enough room for the 3 of us.  She is very hospitable and is eager to give directions and food recommendations.  The neighborhood is nice and safe with a park that's a short walk straight down Dani's street and the subway into the city is just around the corner. We will definitely book Dani's place again.[QWERTY123]We are so pleased that we chose this place to stay. The apartment is comfortable and has all the things you could possibly need. Dani and James were really welcoming and accommodating, they made us feel right at home. 
Situated in a lovely neighbourhood surrounded by great restaurants, shops and coffee shops but also amazingly easy to catch the subway to Manhattan.
 We stayed here to be near friends, but would recommend it as a place to stay for anyone wanting to visit Manhattan, especially those with children. We have booked this place for when we return from our driving holiday to Canada and are really looking forward to going back to a place we feel so comfortable in.[QWERTY123]A wonderful, warm apartment with an accommodating kitchen. Dani is the type of host who shares who enthusiasm for Park Slope in a way that let's you feel like you have known her for a  long time.[QWERTY123]My daughter and I, along with a friend, were guests at Dani's over New Year's. It was our second time staying in the Green Guest House.  The apartment was as wonderful as I remembered it from our first visit.  The location is close to the subway, shopping, groceries and restaurants. We love the neighborhood. The Guest House was immaculate and everything we needed was available from menus to maps and a fully stocked kitchen for cooking. The bathroom was stocked with multiple toiletries and the claw foot tub was great for a relaxing soak. The bed provided a restful sleep and the quiet, peaceful surroundings made us feel at home. I really can't think of a better place to stay while visiting New York. Dani was available throughout our stay and was able to accommodate a late checkout for us on New Year's Day. She was kind enough to mail back to me an item I left in the apartment. Dani is not only a super host, but a genuinely super person!
Cathy, Kate and Jim[QWERTY123]The Park Slope Green Guest house -- and Dani the host -- were fantastic.  Couldn't recommend them more.  My partner and I stayed for two days in the midst of a blizzard and Dani was attentive and the stay was quite comfortable.  Great place run by good people! We'll be back during our next trip to New York.[QWERTY123]We had another wonderful stay at Park Slope Green Guest House. It really was like coming home we felt so comfortable. Again, I would recommend this place to any who wish to explore Manhattan because they will also discover the magic of Brooklyn at the same time.[QWERTY123]Dani was warm and welcoming and has lots of experience hosting grandparents in town to spend time with their young grandkids.  The apartment was clean, well-stocked and nicely decorated - we will certainly stay with Dani again in the future.[QWERTY123]I stayed at Dani's lovely guest house for a wedding and it was simply perfect. It felt like being home as I was there. Dani and her husband are super helpful and nice! The apartment had anything you could possibly need and is located in a great area. I strongly recommend this apartment![QWERTY123]What a great introduction to Airbnb! This was my first reservation, and the Park Slope Green Guest House sets the bar HIGH. 

The apartment is spotless and adorable, and you won’t find a more comfortable bed to collapse in so you can recover from your travels. The kitchen’s stocked with a lot of supplies (coffee, tea, pots, pans, etc.) to get you started, and there are a ton of grocery options nearby if you want to  shop for provisions and eat in. The bathroom has a claw-foot tub for a good soak and filtered shower with great water pressure.  

It’s in a fantastic area of Park Slope with tons of restaurants (and a gym if you’e so inclined) easily within walking distance. There’s so much going on in the neighborhood that you may not want to leave, but if you do you’ll be close to the subway with easy access to other parts of Brooklyn as well as NYC. 

Most of all I loved meeting Dani! She’s a wonderful host who made me feel right at home during my stay. I’m thinking of moving to Brooklyn, and she was more than happy to answer questions I had about Park Slope and beyond. If you’re thinking of visiting New York absolutely consider staying at this gem Dani offers in South Slope![QWERTY123]Dani's place is wonderful and as advertised, and all the surprises were good. Excellent part of town, very close to a train stop, just around the corner from exciting 5th Avenue, lots of restaurants and shops all around. Apartment was quiet and comfy and clean. Kitchen was stocked VERY well, including cleaning supplies, food prep and service instruments, many different coffee-making methods, soaps, etc. Very comfortable queen bed, and pretty comfortable fold-out couch (although only a curtain separated them). Dani made herself very available for key pickup, questions, advice, and lent us umbrellas for unexpected rain. I can't think of how the experience could have been better.[QWERTY123]I had a very enjoyable 2 night stay at the Park Slope Green Guest House in March 2014. Dani was a great host, making us feel welcome and at home right away. Dani was very organised and she made our arrival and departure exceptionally easy. Dani also took the time to give us some great insight into Brooklyn and the surrounding neighbourhoods, which was of great value to me as I am in the process of moving to the area. The guest house is very comfortable, clean and has a well equipped kitchen. It is situated very conveniently, close to the subway and many Brooklyn amenities.

I would not hesitate to recommend Park Slope Green Guest House and am sure many other previous guests feel the same.[QWERTY123]My boyfriend and I stayed in Dani's lovely guesthouse for a weekend in New York. The place was wonderfully decorated and Dani was so helpful! It was so nice to be able to cook at home (and we did feel right at home) when we wanted to. The F train into Manhattan was right there, which made it easy to get around, and the neighborhood was really friendly. This was my first experience with Airbnb and it was just perfect. Thank you Dani!![QWERTY123]My husband and I stayed at Dani’s place for a week in March 2014. We loved it. What a great place to come home to after a busy day in the city! Clean, quiet, comfortable and warm! Dani is a very thoughtful host. Everything you need you will find in this apartment. The kitchen is well equipped; the bathroom has soft towels, a hairdryer, soap, shampoo, etc. The apartment is conveniently located: only a 5 minute walk to the subway station, an easy commute to Manhattan; stores and restaurants are just around the corner; a nice, quiet and safe neighborhood. This is a place we will recommend to our friends and hope to go back to.[QWERTY123]Another great airbnb experience. This apartment was perfect for me - it was quiet, clean, safe, and in a great neighborhood (Park Slope) with tons of places to eat and very close to the subway. Dani, the host, is a lovely person and made me feel very welcome. Zero complaints. Comfortable bed and couch, nice linens, clear instructions for everything.[QWERTY123]Accueil trés chaleureux. Propriétaire disponible. Logement propre, fonctionnel et reposant. Quartier calme mais vivant. Accès direct et rapide à Manhattan par le subway.  Trés satisfait du séjour.[QWERTY123]We had a terrific 4-night stay in this wonderful Park Slope apartment!  Dani could not have been a better host--so available as needed and most accommodating.  The apartment is quiet, bright, clean, comfortable, and well maintained.
It is within walking distance to great shopping, fabulous restaurants, and beautiful Prospect Park, and is in an area that's completely comfortable to walk around in day or night ( and we did!)
We unequivocally recommend both this apartment and it's wonderful host, Dani to anyone wanting to stay in the Park Slope/Windsor Terrace area of Brooklyn.[QWERTY123]This was our first time using Airbnb, and i have to say what a wonderful experience  it was. The apartment looked just like the pictures.  What you see is what you get. Very clean and well stocked. Dani is a wonderful host. Any time i needed to ask her a question via text she replied within minutes. The neighborhood was great and the train station was only a few blocks away. A lot of eating options as well. I truly thank Dani and we will be visiting again.[QWERTY123]What a great experience! The place was immaculate, sunny & well-stocked. Great location, close to the subway and a short walk to Prospect Park. Dani was the perfect host, warm and gracious. She was so helpful with ideas for places to go with the kids and she went out of her way to find accommodations for us when we wanted to stay an extra night and her place was booked. I highly recommend this place if you plan to stay in Brooklyn and we will be back for future visits.[QWERTY123]We loved staying at Dani's apartment. It was perfect for our family (2 adults and 2 kids). Clean, QUIET, and centrally located. Right near subway and Prospect Park. Dani was a fantastic host, she was really responsive and let us text her throughout our stay with questions. I would stay here again - for sure! Thanks Dani.[QWERTY123]Dès notre arrivée, nous avons été accueillis chaleureusement par Dani. Son appartement est très fonctionnel, bien entretenu et situé dans un quartier très calme tout en étant proche du métro, des commerces et divers restaurants.
Rien ne manque dans cet appartement, et nous avons particulièrement apprécié l'ordinateur qui nous a permis d'échanger avec nos proches.
Dani a toujours été très disponible pour nous renseigner et nous conseiller sur divers sujets.
Bref, c'est une adresse à recommander sans hésiter pour visiter New York !!![QWERTY123]Dani was a super host - we were both really busy so barely crossed paths during my stay but her welcome was spot on! The guest house has everything you could want and more in a lovely neighbourhood in Brooklyn within easy walking distance of the subway (even with two enormous cases!). Thanks Dani - hope to be back in NY and see you again![QWERTY123]The Hosts were awesome, friendly, helpful and I felt an instant connection upon arrival.  The apartment was far more than I/we expected.  So clean and filled with all the comforts of home.  Location was extremely nice, being able to go out (even alone) and feel comfortable, made quite an impact.  I could go on and on about how lovely our stay was, the cost far exceeded reasonable.  We've made a pact to return to NY sometime after I retired and we'll be hoping to stay in the same place.  But it's nice knowing that if the apt isn't available, Dani has a list of friends who may be able to accommodate us.  Words are not enough to say what our hearts are feeling about this apartment and the wonderful, kind people that are willing to share it.  Thank you D-J and Z for doing so. :D[QWERTY123]It was my first time using airbnb and I couldn't have started with a better host/place. The apt was immaculate, which is a big deal because my gf is kind of a neat freak, germaphobe. It was spacious, organized and quiet. The location was perfect, lots of nice restaurants and bars within walking distance. All in all it was a great experience and I definitely recommend Dani's place if you're visiting Brooklyn.[QWERTY123]Dani is a really great host and a fantastic person. The apartment is extremely clean, spacious, a great kitchen to cook, a confortable bed, has everything i need. It is close from everything. The neighborhood is amazing. Next time in New York I want to stay here again![QWERTY123]This apartment looked just like the pictures. It was quiet, spacious, and stocked with kitchen and bathroom items. Dani always responded quickly and she was so nice and helpful. We used to live in Park Slope so we knew the area well, and this is a great walkable spot near the subway. I loved that the apartment faced a pretty garden. With the water filter, eco-friendly items, and clearly marked recycling containers, I loved how green this place truly was and I plan on going back if I'm in Brooklyn again.[QWERTY123]This was the perfect place to stay! Dani was very friendly, helpful and always answered our messages promptly, to be of help to us.  The apartment was extremely clean and decorated so nicely. We felt like we were at home and very comfortable. We were very happy to have access to a wonderful Mac computer, also, which was great to surf the internet to plan our activities in the area. This area in Park Slope was in a great location to the train station and we enjoyed walking around in the area for coffee, etc. We will definitely stay there in the future! I highly recommend this place![QWERTY123]we loved this space and most everything about it. very comfortable bed. great living  space to hang out in with roomy kitchen to cook in! 
and in a wonderful neighborhood!
i even liked the fact that there is no wifi (once i got used to the idea).
i would definitely go back! thank you to dani for providing such a nice place!
[QWERTY123]Dani's apartment is exactly what an Airbnb listing should be: a clean apartment with all necessary comforts and a caring and attentive host. Our experience was excellent and the apartment is just as advertised. It is a good size for a couple, or a couple with young children. The location is right in the heart of Park Slope, with easy access to stores and restaurants of all kinds. Public transportation is very close and convenient. A trip to Manhattan takes less than 30 minutes.[QWERTY123]We had a wonderful experience staying at Dani's home.  She met us at the door and showed us to the second floor apartment with it's own locking door, kitchen and bathroom just as shown in the pictures.  Host lives on 1st floor.  Great walkable neighborhood close to subway and we found free parking on the street about 2.5 blocks away.  Our daughters appreciated the natural cleaning products as they get dermatitis from synthetic detergent soaps.  Freezer was stocked with awesome organic coffee![QWERTY123]This was our second time we have experienced the very greatest privilege to stay at Dani's guest apartment. We cannot possibly top our last comment without seeming as though we are gushing.  Airbnb shows over 6,000 listings in Brooklyn.  Could we find a better place with a host of such superlative quality?  Perhaps, but we doubt it.  We would not consider staying anywhere else unless Dani was already booked....even then we know that we would be settling for second best.  Actually the time we usually come into NYC was already booked.  We sulked for about 5 seconds and quickly decided to change our plans so we would be able to stay once again at Dani's place.  If you are looking to book an apartment in a great, quiet, dignified family neighborhood, very near public transportation, great restaurants, grocery store, immaculate accommodations, healthy environment ......most of all, a caring  & trustworthy host family who are very active for positive change not only in their neighborhood but for the benefit of our fellow man and earth as a whole -you need look no further nor say to yourself ""perhaps we should do a bit more comparison shopping"".  We promise you that you will find none better nor be more satisfied than booking your stay with Dani.  Thank you once again Dani for such a delightful stay.  We sincerely hope to stay again with you soon.[QWERTY123]Our family (2 adults, 1 toddler &  a 3 month baby) loved Dani's apartment. Dani was the perfect host and she made us feel just like at home.  Its in her nature being there for others, being helpful, and attentive.  Dani was literally like family to us!

The apartment is fully loaded with all the bells and whistles! The apartment is clean, quiet, and it has a great Feng Shui feeling.  Our family used the kitchen during our stay since we enjoy cooking. However, Park Slope is also known for excellent restaurants and tons of shops in the area.  Its very close to the subway and less than 30 mins away from Manhattan. There were loads of goodies in the fridge and in the food cabinet that Dani encouraged us to help ourselves.  Also, there is filter water.  The bathroom was already equipped with towels, soap, shampoo, etc.  The bedroom and the pull out sofa was comfortable.  Our family truly appreciated Dani's Green guest house with all the natural cleaning products, organic coffee/foods, eco-friendly products, labeled recycled containers, and wired internet connection rather than wireless due to a persons health benefit.

You'll absolutely love staying at Dani's home since its the perfect place in the city.  Yes, this is the very reason Park Slope was named one of America's top 10 neighborhoods! So, what are you waiting for and make this your home away from home![QWERTY123]Our family ( 2 ads+ 1 child 8 year) stayed at Dani's house for 3 weeks and ii was a wonderful experience. Dani and her husband are very kind and helpful . The apartment is extremely  clean , equipped with everything you need  and as shown in the pictures .Dani's  guest house is located in a strategic position close to stores and restaurants of all kinds and to the subway . A trip to Manhattan takes less than 40 minutes.[QWERTY123]This was the second time we've stayed here. As advertised, this apartment is in a great neighborhood with many great restaurants, many proving delivery service if you want to eat in. The apartment is very bright and clean with a very comfortable queen bed and a fully equipped kitchen.  Dani, our host, is very welcoming and helpful. We plan to stay here on our next visit to New York.[QWERTY123]Thank you we had a good stay.[QWERTY123]I can fully recommend this place. It exactly looks like in the pictures, it is clean and well equipped.  The apartment is located in a residential area not far from a metro station. We were two girls, and did feel safe walking there during night.
Dani, the host, is the nicest person you have ever met. She lives in the apartment below, and is very welcoming and approachable. The directions we got from her to find the place were very exact, and made our journey a lot easier.[QWERTY123]We arrived at the Park Slope Green Guesthouse in the early afternoon and were trying to decide on which of the 3 doorbells to press when we heard a happy ""hello! I'm Dani"" from a nearby car and that was the start of our very enjoyable stay in Brooklyn.  

The apartment is just as described online, with a full kitchen, bathroom, living/dining room  and curtained off bedroom. The apartment also has beautiful long windows that make it light filled and there is a general warm ambiance about the place. 
Oh and Yes! The shower was terrific - hot and strong! And 1 more thing there is ample storage for your luggage!

There are also many welcoming extras - condiments and sauces for cooking, butter in the fridge and a helpfully stocked pantry with a choice of several teas for us non coffee drinkers!

There are supermarkets, grocers, restaurants  and bars nearby and Dani is a font of information to set you off on your daily adventure in NYC. It was also lovely just chatting to Dani and passing the time of day. She is available by phone or email or we could just go downstairs and knock on the door if necessary.

If you would like to leave Manhattan and experience another part of NYC, we highly recommend you consider the Park Slope Green Guest House in Brooklyn![QWERTY123]Very welcoming and attentive  host. Very clean apartment in a great location - very much liked the Owl Farm pub on 5th Ave.  Pictures are accurate. Very close to subway. Brooklyn is really good - so different to the energy sapping bustle of Manhattan.  Would stay here again.[QWERTY123]Réception très gentille et ponctuelle . Quartier très attachant[QWERTY123]This apartment in Brooklyn is exactly as pictured and described. Great host, no issues. Everything clean, ready, and perfect for a family of 3. Thanks![QWERTY123]Ottimo, molto gentile, l appartamento e come in foto, pulito e silenzioso. Bel quartiere , mi sono trovata benissimo con il mio bimbo di tre anni. Lo consiglio.[QWERTY123]Dani made us so welcome and as soon as we met her we felt like we had known her forever.  Her lovely red door and beautiful flowers at the door made us so welcome!!  The courtyard was clean and landscaped beautifully, especially for a city row home! Dani emailed us a month in advance to verify our transportation and helping us with directions to her lovely home![QWERTY123]We were pleased to make a return visit to Dani's very inviting Park Slope Green Guest House. Dani is the perfect hostess, and her Guest House provides every amenity and comfort for us when we visit the NYC area. We plan on visiting again many times in the future.[QWERTY123]Dani was a perfect host - very friendly and helpful. The apartment was even nicer than the pictures. It was really comfortable and in a great little area. We'll definitely be back and recommending to friends too.

thanks Dani![QWERTY123]Das Appartement ist super schön und sauber! Es liegt in einem netten Viertel mit tollen Bars und Restaurant  und die Subway ist zu Fuß in 5 Minuten zu erreichen. Die Gastfamilie war sehr nett und hilfsbereit. Wir haben uns sehr wohlgefühlt!
Anstatt WLAN gab es ein pc mit Internetanschluss. Wir kommen gerne wieder![QWERTY123]From the moment we arrived, we could not have felt more welcome at Dani's. We are Brooklyn expatriates, and have been looking for a while for a place to call home on our all too infrequent trips back to our old neighborhood. Dani's mini-apartment--complete with a fully equipped kitchen (including delicious coffee that saved me two mornings in a row), adorable bathroom, real bedroom (by New York standards), and a cozy, comfortable living room complete with a dining table for two and cable TV for guilty late night movie watching--is the perfect place for a short or extremely extended stay. To begin to list all of the thoughtful touches and extra amenities would mean I would have to go on for paragraphs and paragraphs. I would like to mention, though, the thoughtful selection of cooking equipment and pantry essentials in the kitchen; the luxurious toiletries in the bathroom; the exceptionally comfortable bad; and the peace and quiet that only comes from living at the back of a Brooklyn row house. This was our first Airbnb experience as guests, and we are now spoiled for anything else. We wish we had had many more nights at Dani's fabulous place, and plan to come back soon for an actual vacation, rather than a semi-business trip. Thanks, Dani, for showing us that we still have a place in Brooklyn. Oh, and the Chocolove was an especially nice touch![QWERTY123]Dani is an excellent host who strives to make her guests feel at home. The details of the listing are accurate. My husband and I were surprised at how large the space was, in comparison to New York standards. We felt that we were able to move around instead of fighting for space and convenience of a kitchen (with filtered drinking water) is a huge plus. It is a great place to unwind after a long day of subway rides and walking. The subway station is nearby if you want to go to Manhattan but there is plenty to do in Brooklyn, specifically on 5th and 7th Avenue in Park Slope, or you can explore all the other neighborhoods like DUMBO and Carroll Gardens. Dani has fabulous suggestions on what to do, where to eat and places to see if you are not sure of what to do.[QWERTY123]When I've checked-in at the guest house, Dani gave me the detail informations of this guest house kindly. So I was relieved to hear them. Her children also greeted me. I was glad to chat with them. The neighborhood is very convenient. It's so close to a station and a supermarket. On a few days, I returned late night. But I didn't have any dreadful experiences.  Even though you walk alone from the nearest station, it's no problem.

I am moved by her hospitality. Because she had cleaned rooms perfectly and prepared nice goods for guests. For example, it was helpful for me that so many seasoning were in a refrigerator.  I could enjoy cooking every morning.

Because of her hospitality, I could enjoy staying in Brooklyn. Brooklyn has became my favorite.  If I'll go traveling to NY, I hope to stay at her guest house.

Thank you so much! Dani:)
See you again![QWERTY123]Lovely, well-stocked place in a great neighborhood.  Thanks to Dani for her hospitality![QWERTY123]My wife and I stayed at Dani’s place for four days after Thanksgiving. Dani is a warm and welcoming host. She accommodated our late check-in due to an evening flight arrival and oriented us to the amenities and neighborhood.

Dani’s place is centrally located with regards to transportation on a quiet and safe street. It is a few minutes walk to mass transit, car share locations, and even closer to the expanded outer borough green-taxi service. For runners or walkers like us, Prospect Park is short warm up away to miles of trails. The avenues adjacent to Dani’s place have dining options ranging from delis and diners to fine dining in a wide variety of cuisines. Dani even recommended a local farmer’s and craft market where we might be able to get locally made organic baked goods for breakfast.
   
Dani’s place is clean, comfortable, and inviting. WiFi was strong and consistent. Although we didn’t use it, the kitchen is fully-equipped to prepare meals with spices and dried goods left by previous guests. Dani supplied fair-trade organic coffee, though again, we didn’t have the opportunity to try it. We also appreciated that Dani’s place is stocked with environmentally conscious bath products.

I would highly recommend Dani’s place and hope to stay there again when we visit NY![QWERTY123]We spent a week at Dani 's in december and everything was just perfect: warm wellcome, vert cosy appartment, good bed, kitchen well supplied, bathroom too. We appreciated the Green concern and the book of photographs made by Dani's father. Nice neighbourood very close from the subway.[QWERTY123]Great place - will definitely stay here again. Dani had great communication right from the start. The place was clean, quiet, well stocked and easy to get to the F train. Just off 5th ave so food, eats and a social drink couldn't have been easier.
[QWERTY123]This is a great place to stay:  very clean, well appointed, quiet, and close to the subway and interesting restaurants.  Dani was very helpful and ever so kind.[QWERTY123]We had such a wonderful time at Dani's apartment. From the beginning, she was a great communicator, gave excellent and helpful directions and made us feel so welcome before we even got there. 
The apartment was so clean and lovely- it was a total sanctuary. SO quiet and a really comfy bed! It was a perfect spot to return to after long days of exploring and a great location for all the things we wanted to do- close to the subway, good walks, the park, and restaurants. It was great to have a whole notebook of menus to peruse to decide where to eat and so many resources and maps to look at. There were thoughtful touches like little fair trade chocolates and eye masks. We were so grateful to stay somewhere where there weren't a bunch of stinky toxic chemicals too. We will definitely stay here again when we come back to NY. Thanks so much!
[QWERTY123]We had a wonderful stay in Dani's apartment in Park Slope. The location was great - close to a subway stop for longer journeys and close enough to my favorite restaurants in the area (Bogota Bistro and Sun in Bloom) to walk on cold winter nights. 

The kitchen was immaculate and was probably the cleanest I've ever encountered - perfect for someone with various food sensitivities. The bed was super comfortable and the apartment had all we needed.

Dani was a wonderful and friendly host![QWERTY123]Perfect place to stay!  This was our second time renting Dani's place and it was just as good as I remembered.  The apartment is very clean and has everything you need.  SUPER close to the train and walking distance to some great bars/restaurants.  We will definitely stay here again![QWERTY123]Back again staying at Dani's for the third time.  When we visit our daugher and family in Brooklyn,  this is our favorite place to stay.  Dani is a gracious host providing many guest amenities.  Love the coffee and the chocolates and the big window in the kitchen!  Look forward to coming back for stay # 4.   and did I say, it is so clean and the bed is really comfy.[QWERTY123]I loved this apartment!  I was attracted to the apartment because of the hosts' value of our environment!  The location was so convenient. The apartment was very comfortable and full of amenities.  Dani and James were so friendly and made sure to let me know they were readily available should I need anything.  However, the apartment was so great, I didn't need a thing!  Dani stayed in close touch with me once I reserved the apartment.  I will definitely ask to stay at this apartment again![QWERTY123]The apartment is really great.  It is very clean, well equipped, and in a terrific location.  We had a really nice stay here.  I would highly recommend this place to anyone coming to Brooklyn.[QWERTY123]My stay at Dani's guest house was great. Dani greets you and explains the keys and the apartment. The apartment contains everything you need to be at home--and more! The apartment is spotless, comfortable, and quiet. In the morning, I could grind and brew organic coffee.  During any downtime I could watch something on tv or use the provided Mac. The bed is crisply made and very comfortable--much better than most hotels. I even did the laundry right around the corner on my last day; it couldn't have been easier. Every detail shows Dani's care of her home and hospitality. I would stay again and recommend it to friends and family coming to Brooklyn! Thank you![QWERTY123]The apartment was clean, comfortable and tastefully appointed.  The host was friendly, gracious and accommodating.  The neighborhood was quiet and felt very safe.  We will definitely consider staying at this venue in the future.[QWERTY123]Dani was very accommodating with arrival and departure schedules.
She is also available for information or if any needs arise via text message or phone which is very convenient.
The apartment was very bright, clean, nicely furnished, quiet and well stocked.  This Air BnB is in a great location in Bklyn with the subway, grocery stores and many dining options nearby.[QWERTY123]Clean, comfortable and quiet sleeping space. Very nice amenities and kind hosts. What more could you ask for![QWERTY123]As advertised and even better than expected! Park Slope Green Guesthouse is the perfect spot for a comfortable, relaxing stay - and a great place to retreat after a stimulating day in New York City.  Dani went above and beyond to attend to me, make herself available, answer questions. The house is clean, quiet, comfortable and has all of the amenities that you could want. I'd come back in a minute.  There is no way any hotel, luxury or otherwise, could compete with the amenities here.  Dani was available, but also allowed us privacy. Very glad we found this place and looking forward to returning![QWERTY123]We LOOOVED this place, It was very cute, clean, quiet and spacious. We had lower expectations for the size and thought the pictures were just well taken, however the space truly is as big as it looks! The bed and sofa bed were super comfortable, the bathroom was clean and packed with all kinds of natural and organic toiletries. It felt like a special treat to try out new things. The pantry and fridge were packed with tea and coffee and small items that made having something to eat in between meals easy. The neighborhood was quiet, and we felt safe even when we came in late. It was very easy to get around town as well.Dani was very welcoming, helpful, and responsive. Unless we decide to visit another burrough of NY next time this is our new place![QWERTY123]apartment beautiful ... and Dani and wife exquisite people and available in case of need ... very quiet and pleasant without confusion ...[QWERTY123]Dany did everything to make us feel home. From giving us tips on how to get to the place, to allowing us to leave our bags before check-in and check-out. I stayed there with my parents and 2 year old and we enjoyed it! The organic tea and coffee made available in the apartment made us feel welcome (and my son loved the cereals and puzzles). We will definitely come back.[QWERTY123]Nous avons beaucoup apprécié l'accueil de Dani, la proximité du métro et le quartier très calme (nuit au calme après la journée à Manhattan) à recommander sans hésiter[QWERTY123]Très bon accueil. Dani est serviable, souriante et très gentille. L'appartement est fidèle aux photographies et très bien équipé. Il est situé à 20-30 min de Manhattan, dans un quartier sympa, proche de Prospect Park où il faut absolument aller se promener... Un + non négligeable : possibilité de laisser ses bagages chez Dani après le check-out et avant de prendre l'avion. 
Merci Dani :)
Nous gardons votre adresse pour un prochain voyage ![QWERTY123]Dani was excellent at responding to my inquiries quickly. The apartment suited my family's needs. It's also quick to get to many great restaurants and shops in the neighbourhood. The apartment was clean and well looked after.[QWERTY123]We came to Brooklyn for my brother's wedding. We needed a sleeping arrangement for 2 nights. Upon arrival, we realized that we would actually need only 1 night to spend at the apartment. When the evening came, my baby fell asleep at my brother's apartment and we didn't want to wake him up. I asked Dani if that was ok if my parents spent the night there instead of us and she was more than understanding.
Dani was extremely nice and responsive through the entire process, the apartment was exactly as in the description. I just wish we had a chance to enjoy it more :)[QWERTY123]We had a wonderful time in Dani's greenhouse. We had everything we needed and it was very close to the subway stop. Bed was comfy and Dani was a pleasure[QWERTY123]From the moment my husband and I arrived, our host Dani made us feel warmly welcome. She was friendly and helpful and we very much enjoyed our conversations with her! Our first floor apartment was comfortable and well equipped and generously supplied with everything to make a traveller feel immediately at home, from organic shampoo to a well stocked pantry.  We enjoyed exploring the local neighbourhood, and can vouch for Dani's recommendations: the  Green Kitchen for a tasty meal and Cafe Regular for very good coffee. Prospect Park is nearby and a lovely place to stroll during the beautiful spring weather we experienced. Our Park Slope apartment was not only a great place for getting to know Brooklyn, but also a perfect base  for seeing the rest of New York, with the subway to Manhattan being just a couple of blocks away. We would definitely recommend this apartment for anyone wanting a great place to stay in Brooklyn/ New York.[QWERTY123]Second time here. I stayed one wonderful month in Dani's apartment.
Everything was perfect. 
The apartment is extremely clean and comfortable. The neighborhood is amazing. 
I have just good things to say.[QWERTY123]5 star accommodations. We had such a great time. This apartment place gives your a feeling that its been lived in, not like a standard hotel room. Refrigerator and pantry are equipped with stuff previous tenants left behind. This place is the perfect size for a couple to stay. Park Slope has some amazing restaurants and shops. We recommend the first day you get there to walk down 5th avenue and see what's around. Our favorite restaurants were Stone Park Cafe and Talde. Prospect Park is in walking distance and the Brooklyn Bridge park is a few train stops away. Overall we had a great time and would definitely come back.[QWERTY123]We could not have chosen a better host or lodgings for our first airbnb experience. The guest house was perfect for the two of us and is in a wonderful neighborhood. Dani makes it easy for guests to be environmentally conscious, and I really appreciated staying in a space where chemical cleaners and deodorizers are not used. In addition, Dani was a great host. She met us very early in the morning on the day of our arrival so we could leave our bags even though check-in wasn't until later in the day. She also provided some great recommendations for outings and meals.[QWERTY123]My family and I had an awesome vacaton!
My wife, my 10-Years-Old son and I spent 30 days in July 2015 at Dani's house and everything was absolutely perfect. Dani is a great host and her apartment is very confortable and better than described in Airbnb. Dani's house is a perfect place for one day one week or on month. We felt lide it was home and we would definitely stay in Dani´s house again on our next vacation in NYC. 
Thanks Dani.[QWERTY123]Dani ist eine wirklich tolle Gastgeberin gewesen. Sie hat sich schon im Vorfeld unserer Ankunft mit uns in Verbindung gesetzt, um sicherzugehen, dass wir den sichersten und besten Anfahrtsweg nehmen. Ihr Haus liegt in einer ruhigen und schönen Straße in Brooklyn. Die Wohnung befindet sich im ersten Stock und ist komplett ausgestattet. Eine Klimaanlage ist auch vorhanden. Es befinden sich Karten der Subway und verschiedene Umgebungspläne in der Wohnung. Es gab auch WiFi und ein iMac steht zusätzlich zur Verfügung. Das Bett ist groß und bequem gewesen. Von Danis Haus ist man in drei Minuten an der Subway und innerhalb von zehn Minuten kann man sich durch alle Facetten des Essensangebotes Brooklyns futtern. Einkaufsmöglichkeiten sind auch bis spät abends vorhanden. Frühstückmöglichkeiten sind mehr als genug da. Bis Flatbush geht man etwa 20 Minuten und taucht dabei sehr gut in das Leben Brooklyns ein. Manhatten ist innerhalb von 15 Minuten zu erreichen, JFK in etwa einer Stunde per Bahn. La Guardia geht eigentlich nur per Taxi und kostet etwa 38$, was aber nicht an der Lage der Wohnung liegt, sondern daran, dass La Guardia ohne ÖPNV-Anschluss ist.
Wir können Dani und ihre Unterkunft jedem ans Herz legen, dem Manhattan zum Wohnen zu laut und hektisch ist und der vielleicht eine andere Seite New Yorks fernab der Glas- und Stahlarchitektur entdecken möchte.[QWERTY123]We have just concluded our 3rd time staying at Dani's wonderful Park Slope Green Guest Nest.  What a privilege it is to stay in such a wholesome, safe, spotless and charming apartment - just upstairs from Dani herself.  Space does not allow me to elaborate overmuch - our  past reviews stand - we would not change a single thing about our stay.  Seriously - not a thing.  We cannot even imagine staying elsewhere when staying in the NYC area.  We cannot think of another way to pay to someone the highest compliment possible but that we don't even consider staying anywhere else.  We have shopped around - thoroughly,  and firmly believe it would be impossible to find better accommodations - and even more important to us - find another airbnb host that is more gracious, trustworthy, honest, helpful - Dani and her family are the dream family everybody wishes lived next door, or downstairs, or.........We still can't quite figure out just how we got so lucky and fell upstairs - literally:)  Dani's Green Guest House comes completely stocked with everything essential  thing to make your stay comfortable.  Additional bonuses - Bus/Subway literally just steps away.  Grocery stores, restaurants, bakeries - again just steps away.  Yet while being so close to everything, Dani's delightful apartment is a tranquil  retreat situated on a lovely, quiet, extremely safe and sunny street.   We have walked the neighborhood at all times of the day and quite late into the night yet never once felt uneasy in this great family neighborhood.   We know there will come a time when due to Dani's great reputation on airbnb she will be fully booked thus we will have to search elsewhere (knuckles dragging)  But until then we would (and have) drastically changed our plans in order to once again have the privilege of staying at Dani's Green Guest House.  We cannot possibly recommend Dan's place enough.  We can only hope we were good guests ourselves.
[QWERTY123]Dani's Park Slope Green Guest House was the perfect, reasonably-priced accommodations for our week in New York.  The neighborhood is safe and quiet, with diverse dining and grocery shopping options, especially along 5th Avenue, less than a block away. The apartment was clean and comfortable, with easy access to nearby subways and bus routes, enabling us to get around Brooklyn and into Manhattan with ease.  Dani is a delightful, thoughtful host who provided the apartment with interesting, informative, off-the-beaten-path tourist-oriented reading materials, as well as cable TV. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend her place to other intrepid Airbnb travelers.[QWERTY123]For those interested in experiencing how real people live in New York, we recommend staying at Dani's in Brooklyn. Dani is very warm and welcoming, and this apartment is in a lovely quiet, tree-lined street - a great respite after our long, international flight. We felt like locals in a couple of days - nearby cafes are friendly, provide good food and are keen to accomodate food intolerances. Although Manhatten is only a short subway trip away - with all the must-see places - we highly recommend allocating some time to experience this local neighborhood, including a few hours wandering through the delightful, Prosect Park.
 All essential items (and more) are provided by Dani and her environmentally-friendly approach is a treat when travelling.[QWERTY123]Nous avons été reçus chaleureusement par Dani, elle a été très attentionnée à notre égard. L'appartement était conforme à la description, propre, cosy et il y  avait même quelques trucs à manger et à boire dans le réfrigirateur. Le logement est situé dans un quartier calme et branché de Brooklyn, l'ambiance y est très cool.[QWERTY123]Our 3 night stay at Dani's place was perfect.  The location was great and the apartment was immaculate.  Dani made us feel right at home.  I was pleasantly surprised how well equipped the kitchen was.  We ended up making a full dinner in the apartment on two of the nights.[QWERTY123]Great place to stay in Brooklyn with easy access to Manhattan. Friendly and helpful host lives on first floor. Loved having a computer and wifi. Missed not having microwave but since we were there only 2-1/2 days it worked out fine. NYC was experiencing unseasonably hot weather for September; A/C window unit quite noisy.[QWERTY123]We couldn't have asked for a better place to stay. The apartment was super clean and there was everything we needed and more. Dani was really nice and helpful. Wonderful neighborhood ![QWERTY123]Dani was very sweet and provided such a lovely place to stay! It was very spacious and there were tons of extra amenities I was not expecting. This is an ideal location and I will definitely be returning whenever I am in the city next. THANK YOU![QWERTY123]Great experience! Dani was very easy to get a hold of and the apt was immaculate! So clean and full of explanatory notes about the apt and brochures and menus! So considerate! Love the organic coffee, filtered water and organic beauty and cleaning products! I felt at ease letting my 11 month old crawl around! Will definitely book again![QWERTY123]Delightfully quiet little nest in multi-ethnic safe neighborhood.[QWERTY123]Dani's place was great.  It was spacious (for New York!), clean, and in a great location, close to lots of cafes, shops, restaurants, and public transportation. Dani recommended some great places for us, and had a wealth of brochures, pamphlets, and general information in the room. She was extremely responsive to messages and texts, thorough, and always around when we needed her. I felt bad because our baby can be quite loud and had a few bad nights, but she was very kind and accommodating about it. I would definitely stay here again next time I come to Brooklyn.

(For anyone traveling with kids - this is a great spot and neighborhood for kids.)[QWERTY123]Dani is a perfect host. She gave us all information we needed. It was just to ask if we needed someting. We got great descriptions how to get to the aparment.  Easy to follow. Good kitchen, nice bathroom and comfortable beds. The area is quiet. I usually use earplugs when I am sleeping but they were not needed. We took subway to Manhattan and it was easy. 
If we are coming back to NY we will ask Dani if we can stay with her again. Great  stay! 

[QWERTY123]Just as last time, my stay with Dani and her family was an absolute delight. My husband and I were Park Slope residents for many (many!) years, and Dani's listing is located in prime territory, within easy walking distance of all that makes this signature Brooklyn neighborhood special. This is an ideal short- or long-term oasis for the business as well as the vacation traveler. A very comfortable queen-size bed, comfy living/dining room, excessively charming clawfoot tub and original tiled bathroom floor, and full (!!!) renovated kitchen, stocked with all the essentials (yes, coffee!) make this an unbeatable value -- and the access to transit combined with Dani's thoughtful details and concern for her guests make it irresistible! If you are ever lucky enough to snag a few nights at Dani's, do so...she's usually booked to the gills. You'll be happy you stayed at this six-star listing -- it'll be your own ""best of New York.""[QWERTY123]I stayed with my husband and young son for two nights at Dani's apartment and we could not be more pleased! From the start, Dani was friendly, helpful and communicative in making our reservation and also arranging check-in (our flight arrived a bit late). The apartment is fantastic...from the perfect location just off of Fifth Avenue and two blocks from the subway to the super-comfy bed to the stocked and well-appointed kitchen to the HOT water and great water pressure in the shower...we LOVED the Green Guest House.  It's perfect for a couple or small family with a young child and is sunny and comfortable.  We will definitely be back and will recommend Dani's apartment to friends visiting NYC.[QWERTY123]We stayed at the apartment for the NYC marathon and it was perfect! Great location close to the subway and in a great area of park slope. Most importantly, the apartment was quiet, Dani was super nice and accommodating, the place was very clean and comfortable, and added bonus: great shower head that felt amazing the day after the marathon. Would highly recommend staying here! Thanks for having us Dani![QWERTY123]Dani's guest home was such a great experience. Dani was very accommodating, friendly and courteous. The guest home was cozy, clean and attractive. As an added plus the best coffee in Brooklyn is only steps away as are many restaurants to choose from. The conveniences were limitless.[QWERTY123]Thank you Dani for a great stay!! The apt is on the second floor and is spotlessly clean. It's more spacious than the pictures can show & Dani has thoughtfully provided everything you need. Tea, coffee and a well stocked pantry if you choose to cook. Comfy bed and yes the shower felt great after a day of walking the city. Great location, easy access to the train and a short walk to Prospect park. Dani was very helpful & available as needed. When our arrival was delayed she did not mind adjusting. Thanks for the Brooklyn hospitality!![QWERTY123]This was my first Airbnb experience, and I was completely blown away. The apartment is quite spacious and peaceful, located in a beautiful building in a great neighborhood. Dani is an exceptional host, providing lots of little extras like coffee, those pantry items you don't think of when you travel and try to cook a meal, and even organic bath products. There's a giant binder of menus for local restaurants, as well as maps and brochures for local attractions. Everything you could possibly want is within walking distance. I was there to visit my brother, and I imagine that any other family members who go visit him will now try to book this apartment. I would definitely stay here again when I'm visiting Brooklyn.[QWERTY123]Dani is a fantastic host and her place is attractive, clean, comfortable, and thoughtfully stocked with basic things one might need. One of the best ABBs I have experienced. Neighborhood is very nice and the apartment is close to public transportation. I'd stay here again anytime![QWERTY123]Dani was friendly and made us feel welcome.  We loved the location in Park Slope, Brooklyn, quiet, clean neighbourhood and lots of eateries.  The flat was extremely clean, well equipped and comfortable.  It was great to have the computer and wifi.  Thank you, Dani, was helping us to have a wonderful stay in New York City.[QWERTY123]We basically just needed somewhere to sleep at night. That's what we got. The Subway was a little scary for me bad that was our main transportation. But all-in-all, we got what we needed.[QWERTY123]Dani  and her husband and the apt was great!  We would and will definitely go back again.  Very close to subway.  She even provide luggage racks!  The towels were nice and fluffy and absorbent.  They ever had tabs on them so they were easy to hang on hooks.  The place were stock with everything you need.   There's internet connection and cable TV.[QWERTY123]Dani was a great host and made us feel welcome right from the beginning. The apartment was just the way we expected it to be: everything was clean, the kitchen was equipped with the items/utensils we needed and the living and bed rooms were comfortable. We used the subway most of the time and were happy that there was a subway station right around the corner. Dani was also very helpful with information regarding gluten-free eateries in the area and she really went out of her way to help us reschedule our flights back home. Thanks, Dani![QWERTY123]This was the second time I have stayed in the Park Slope Green Guest House and it is my favorite place to stay in Brooklyn. The apartment is exactly as described and depicted in the listing, it is spacious and very clean, and Dani is great to work with. Dani's attention to detail makes this space special. There are several books about the area and a binder full of restaurant menus, which made it easy to order food the first night after a late arrival. We took the hand written suggestion in the Peppino's menu to order the Margherita with extra basil and it was delicious! We really appreciated the thoughtfulness that goes into making this a clean and cozy space, and will definitely return.[QWERTY123]Dani's Guest House was a wonderful, clean, well-stocked  and well-priced place to stay in Brooklyn.  The bed was very comfortable, great linens and a usable and clean kitchen.  Dani was very easy to communicate with.  The whole stay was delightful and I would stay there again.  Highly recommended![QWERTY123]I would highly recommend this listing. The accommodations are exactly as described. It has all the conveniences of home, and lots of space. The neighborhood has a great selection of bars, restaurants, convenience & food shops. Quick walk to the subway for easy access to & from the listing.  Dani is a great host who made sure our stay was pleasant & comfortable.[QWERTY123]My husband, 2 young kids, and I had the best time in Brooklyn! The pictures don't do this apartment justice- it was much larger than I was expecting!  Dani provided everything we could have needed from coffee to organic shampoo.   The apartment is on a nice quiet block (which we appreciated with kids), but also is only 3 blocks from subway and tons of great restaurants.  We definitely hope to return![QWERTY123]My daughter and I stayed at the Park Slope Green Guest House over New Year's, it was our third time there . We love Dani and the apartment! We feel so fortunate to have a place to stay in New York that feels like home with a host who makes you feel like family. Our only regret is that we wish we had more time to chat with Dani.[QWERTY123]Dani was very welcoming.  The cozy one bedroom apartment was fully furnished, clean, and centrally located near stores and restaurants.  We felt very much at home there.[QWERTY123]Nice location. Close to the subway and very comfortable apartment. Dani was easy to contact and was very helpful.[QWERTY123]We really enjoyed our stay at the green guest house! It was clean, comfortable and very cozy. Dani was very responsive in all her communications and greeted is upon arrival and gave us a quick tour of the place. Great location, would definitely recommend staying here. Dani is a wonderful host![QWERTY123]Dani was a warm and welcoming host. The apartment was spotlessly clean, and there were a lot of extra touches that made me feel like a family guest rather than a renting tenant. I've stated at many, many short term rentals over the past 17 years, and this was one of the very best.[QWERTY123]My husband and I really enjoyed our stay at Dani's guesthouse. It was super cozy with everything we needed to feel right at home, the neighborhood was a lot of fun to explore, and the specific location was just a short walk to a subway station that made it really convenient to access anywhere in the city we wanted to go.

Dani herself was friendly and communicative throughout the whole experience from trip planning to check out. She made us feel so welcome when we arrived and gave us a quick tour of the apartment to help us get settled in and recommended some really great restaurants nearby. 

Also, we really appreciate Dani's flexibility in allowing us to change our reservation dates at the last minute since we had to change our flight and other plans due to winter weather that week.

In all, we really couldn't have asked for a better experience and we would love to come back to stay in future visits to New York. Thanks for everything, Dani![QWERTY123]This is the third time I've stayed with Dani...her place is my home away from home when I'm in my old stomping grounds on business. I wish I could give Dani fifteen stars for quality, ambiance, amenities, service and just general good vibes...Dani's become a real friend, and it's because she genuinely embodies the values Airbnb trumpets as its own--a welcoming heart, great respect for others, and a very healthy sense of humor. The Green Guest House truly has everything you need for a short or long stay--it's a studio apartment masquerading as ""one room,"" and if you ever stay anywhere in the New York area, you know (1) how rare this is and (2) what a fantastic value this is. Every need is provided for, from toiletries to coffee (bless you, Dani) to organic chocolates (bless you again!) to (Website hidden by Airbnb) always fun to discover what the last guests have left in the pantry and try to figure out where they're from! What more can I say? Just book in at the Green Guest House and enjoy the best of a true Brooklyn host, and the best of Brooklyn's best neighborhood (OK, I'm a little biased here perhaps but it's the truth). You'll be thrilled you found this gem, and like me, you'll return again and again.[QWERTY123]My daughters and I had an excellent time. The apartment was comfortable, well equipped and well heated (it was super cold outside). The neighborhood was great and Dani was an outstanding host.[QWERTY123]Dani communicated via email and text in a timely manner.  She made us feel very comfortable in reaching her destination.
It was obvious she took the rental and quality of communication serious.  
Yes the apartment was as described.  The entire place is private which includes a sleeping room (comfy bed), a living room (internet access) a small working or dining table, a galley type kitchen and a bathroom complete with shower/cast iron tub.
The entire place was clean and very secure.  The neighbourhood was quiet, safe and friendly.  Kitchen accessories were adequate for our needs.  We ate and sometimes cooked breakfast, frequently  cooked our main evening meal.  NYC is expensive so we economized where we were able. Needless to say we searched out some amazing iconic eateries. Could not figure out how to operate the can opener.  
Dani quickly answered our queries and was more then willing to assist us when texted. She lives downstairs, but often was engaged elsewhere when we were at the apt. To get to Laguardia Airport take the F subway and hook up with the Q 70 at Jackson Rooselvelt Av.  Easy transfer and cheap! 
The neighbourhood was quaint and offered  amenities for easy grocery shopping, cell phone card, wine and spirits.  
Subway was a short 5 minute walk.
Dani was always very pleasant and helpful.
Worth the money if you are okay using the subway system.[QWERTY123]Dani was the ultimate AirBnB hostess-- welcoming, informing, and discreet. We loved the little apartment, which was near any kind of restaurant, shop, drug store, coffee nook, you might want, and so near the subway with easy access to Manhattan.

We would recommend this place for anyone, business or pleasure.

Sophie & Kate[QWERTY123]This was a truly excellent Airbnb experience. Dani was incredibly welcoming (and flexible in accommodating our last minute delay in arriving) but also provided us with a very generous amount of privacy. The apartment was quiet, perfectly situated, and incredibly well equipped (coffee and coffee makers; copious toiletries; very comfortable bed; great, and well stocked, kitchen; cable TV and WIFI; lovely bathroom; etc.). And, it's very conveniently located in walking distance to the heart of Park Slope's eclectic shops and restaurants. We even found parking right outside. I would highly recommend this Airbnb.[QWERTY123]We want to thank Dani and James for having us in there green apartment. Everything described was right on. Dani was very welcoming and accommodating. We were close to subway which was really great. We had some good food at the restaurants in the area. Prospect Park is jus a few blocks away which was perfect since we had our 10 year old son with us.  We really can't wait to come back and stay again.[QWERTY123]Absolutely fantastic stay. Beautiful apartment in a peaceful neighbourhood not far from shops, restaurants and the subway. Dani was very friendly and went out of her way to stay up late when a flight was delayed for which we are very grateful! Thanks Dani :)[QWERTY123]L'accueil était chaleureux. Il y avait des chocolats,du café bio et de quoi dépanner pour manger (riz pâtes épices beurre yaourt oeufs sucre...) et les menus des restaurants alentours. L'appartement était conforme à la description, confortable,propre et très bien équipé et le quartier est 
calme et agréable, le métro à quelques pas dessert manhattan en une vingtaine de minutes à peine. La literie est confortable et des produits de toilette sont à disposition. On se sent tout de suite chez soi.[QWERTY123]Dani was a wonderful host. She was very hospitable and made us feel like long time friends. The apartment was very nice and I loved the soaking tub!!!  We were just blocked away from the subway station and could get to any part of the city pretty conveniently!  Thank you!![QWERTY123]Dani is a fantastic host. She is really helpful about the neighborhood and great at providing resources. She is quick to respond to any questions you have and makes you feel instantly comfortable. The apt is sun-filled, impeccably clean and thoughtfully arranged. She does a great job of anticipating your needs. The place was perfect for us, in a great location, just blocks from Prospect Park. We have stayed with Dani before, and plan to for future visits.[QWERTY123]My teenagers and I spent a week at Dani's Guest House. Dani is naturally a nice and a warm person. Moreover, she is an experienced host and anticipates her guests needs. She can be very helpful if needed. Her house is located in a very peaceful but lively neighborhood with all kinds of shops and restaurants,  not far from the subway station. 
I would recommend this Guest House for people who want to live the crazy life of Manhattan but still want to experience the more subtle way of living of young American families.[QWERTY123]Thank you Dani for our time at your home. We found our first airbnb experience to be very positive and enjoyable. We came from a hotel in Manhatten and the space and quietness of your apartment was so appreciated. A great place to stay if you don't mind using the subway...we got it sorted quite quickly and enjoyed the commute into Manhatten. We also enjoyed the many cafes and  restaurants around the corner. ...quieter and cheaper then Manhatten. Thank you again.[QWERTY123]Dani was very welcoming and helpful with the instructions for using the apartment, particularly the keys. She was there when we left, too.

The apartment is a neat brick building and is roomy, clean and very comfortable with good instructions about the tv, kitchen and waste disposal. Also nice and quiet.

The subway stop is two blocks away and the neighborhood is safe and well lighted.

An ""A"" for everything about it.[QWERTY123]Very kind and helpful hostess, and a nice appartment with high standard. The neighborhood is very friendly with lots of good restaurants with value for money.[QWERTY123]Dani is very helpful and super positive hostess. Dani gave us good instructions how to get to the apartment from JFK with train. When we arrived everything in apartment was as described. Dani gave us quick instructions around the apartment and gave us restaurant tips upon arrival. Nice and quiet neighborhood to relax after wandering around the Manhattan for hours.
Lots of shops and restaurand in the area. Subway only two blocks away. Really nice stay![QWERTY123]Dani was super welcoming and very accommodative. We wanted to drop off our bags much earlier before check-in time so we could have the full day in the city without lugging around our bags. She was very flexible with this and even set our baggage up in the apartment and had the ac running to cool us down after a hot memorial day. 

The apartment was very sizable and airy for two. Also loved Dani's focus on keeping all natural products for everything...certainly a different aspect that stands out with all the airbnb's I've stayed out. Also, the convenience near the subway, the park, and shops can't be beat.[QWERTY123]Dani's apartment was one of the best parts of our trip to Brooklyn. It's on a quiet street, close to restaurants, bars and shops, and a short walk to the subway. Also, it's about a 15 minute walk to gorgeous Prospect Park.  We woke up to chirping birds, made coffee and breakfast in the well stocked kitchen then set out for a day of activities in Brooklyn and Manhattan. It was nice to return to our cozy, comfortable and very quiet apartment. Dani has thoughtfully created a nice space for travelers. We're already planning our next stay. Thank you, Dani![QWERTY123]Dani was friendly, warm, and responsive. When I mentioned that I was traveling from Newark airport to their home, she offered me helpful and detailed routes to take - thank you! Dani's home is very clean, comfortable, and more than spacious for the two of us. The neighborhood is safe and the location is very convenient to take the subway to Manhattan. Also, the place has more than everything we need, and I really felt right at home! Thank you Dani for a lovely stay. When I'm back in New York, I will definitely stay here again![QWERTY123]This was our first Airbnb experience and I hope Dani hasn't set the bar too high for our future experiences. First - her and James' welcome and hospitality were so warm and inviting. The apartment had everything we could have asked for and more. The apartment was in a perfect location, only two blocks from the train station. Good shopping and dining in the area was easy to find.

I was especially impressed by several points. The apartment was immaculate. The size was perfect for the two of us. The bed was incredibly comfortable. Dani leaves several friendly notes with clear descriptions about how to use the computer, connect to the internet, and use other technology in the home. She has truly thought ahead about what her visitors' needs would be and made sure to address those needs in advance. 

She has fair trade coffee in the freezer, makes recycling easy, and has healthy, non-gmo soaps and shampoos available for use. It made us feel good to stay with people who cares so much about the environment and the world around them.

Before our visit, Dani communicated with us to make sure we knew how to get to her home from the airport. She and James showed a wonderful level of care and concern for us while allowing us our privacy to enjoy our stay. Honestly, they seem like such wonderful, lovely people who are proud of their neighborhood, home, and city. We cannot wait to stay with them again![QWERTY123]Dani was very friendly and welcoming.  The apartment was charming and functional; we enjoyed our stay very much. Dani recommended nearby dining spots; we tried the Peruvian cafe in the neighborhood and it was delightful. Great location a short walk to the subway.[QWERTY123]Dani was the perfect host! The apartment was beautiful and well equipped for our stay. She was readily available and so amenable and kind. We couldn't have asked for a better host or place to stay while in Brooklyn! 

The apartment was less than a 3 block walk to the subway so access to Manhattan was incredibly easy as well as other parts of Brooklyn. The neighborhood felt very safe and there were lots of places to find something to eat and drink. 

The apartment itself was a lovely place to stay and was very spacious even with 3 people in it. Dani was also great about letting us leave our bags and even offered us a later check out if we needed it which took a lot of pressure off us. I would definitely stay with Dani again if she'll have me!![QWERTY123]We very much enjoyed a six-night stay at Dani's Park Slope Green Guest House in Brooklyn. This is our third visit at Dani's guest house, and as in our previous visits, everything about the apartment, its location, and Dani's warm hospitality suited us perfectly. This is our preferred place to stay in New York on our annual visits.[QWERTY123]This was my first experience with AirBnB.  Dani was so welcoming, and it really gave us peace of mind to know that she was in the building and available if we needed her.  The apartment was lovely and so comfortable!  It was so much better than staying in a hotel, because it felt like we had a little home for a few days.  Dani's building is easily accessible to transit--just a short walk to a number of trains.  The neighborhood was great to explore, with many options for food and shops.  I could not have asked for a better place to stay![QWERTY123]Dani was a great host and the apartment was perfect for our Brooklyn get-away.  Great location in Park Slope.  Clean and accommodating.  I would recommend this and would love to return again![QWERTY123]L'accueil a été chaleureux et l'appartement est bien équipé. Mais il est un peu loin des centres d'intérêts de Manhattan (Central Park, etc.). La bouche de métro n'est pas loin mais le métro ne passe pas assez souvent. L'appartement était propre même si la salle de bains aurait besoin d'un petit rafraîchissement...[QWERTY123]We were very happy to stay with Dani.  The accommodations were very nice and Dani is very pleasant.[QWERTY123]We have just completed our fourth delightful stay with Dani and her little family.  We can think of nothing to add that our three previous reviews did not already say.  As always - The apartment was immaculate and  stocked with everything we might need.  This apartment has truly become a home away from home. Dani is always discreetly available if needed. How great to live like a local with your own apartment, grocery store on the corner, favorite restaurants and bakeries within blocks of each other and the added bonus of public transportation just two blocks away. We cannot recommend this listing enough. There might be other listings and hosts that are also great but honestly feel there could be none greater than Dani. We count it an honor and privilege to have the opportunity to stay at Dani's Brooklyn apartment. Thanks so much for yet another perfect stay![QWERTY123]Loved our stay with Dani. Close to the subway in a lovely quiet neighborhood. Lots of amenities close by. Dani was very accessible by phone. Would definitely recommend.[QWERTY123]Dani was quite accommodating regarding our late arrival. She greeted us at the door and showed us around the unit. She was helpful in offering recommendations for nearby restaurants where we could get brunch on Saturday morning. This house is in a great location in Park Slope with restaurants, shops, clothing stores, grocery stores, etc., all within walking distance. And it's only a couple of blocks from the subway. The unit was nice and cute and exactly as described.[QWERTY123]We loved the location and the neighborhood. We would definitely stay here again.[QWERTY123]Our flight got in very late and Dani was awake to greet us with a smile. She was available as we needed and very helpful with what to do in the Park Slope area. Leading up to the trip she always communicated in a timely manner. Very friendly. The apartment felt like home with all the amenities (even organic coffee stocked in the freezer and organic shampoo and soaps in the shower.) Two minute walk to the best coffee I've had (Cafe Regular) and 5 minute walk to the subway to Manhattan. Park Slope is a very hip place with amazing food and we never felt unsafe. We rented bikes and found the area to be very bike friendly. We explored much of Manhattan and found Park Slope to be right down our alley. We would stay their again if we ever make it back!! Perfect for our anniversary. Thanks again Dani!![QWERTY123]What a great place to be, Dani and James are the best and we are coming back[QWERTY123]Lägenheten var väldigt bra för våra behov, vi reste med vår ettåriga dotter och bodde i 13 nätter. Läget i Park Slope är mycket bra med allt man behöver i form av butiker, restauranger, tunnelbana ProspectParkoch lekplatser runt hörnet. Dani var mycket hjälpsam och vi uppskattade att det fanns gott om schampoo, tvål och diskmedel tillgängligt och att vi hade möjlighet att byta sängkläder ofta. Vi har varit i New York flera gånger tidigare och ville denna gång upptäcka mer än Manhattan och här kände vi verkligen att vi fått en helt perfekt Brooklyn-upplevelse.[QWERTY123]The apartment was immaculate!  Dani was amazing!  Informative and available. It was above my expectations and I recommend it highly.  Loved the neighborhood.  Restaurants galore.  Consider this ""your home away from home.""
[QWERTY123]Dani is a wonderful host! Super nice and attentive. We had some last minutes delays on check out and Dani was absolutely helpful and sort things to allow us stay a bit longer.  She also assist with booking our taxi and we felt she realy cares!The apartment is well located, the neighborhood is fantastic with tons of cool restaurants,bars and shops. The apartment is basic and not very big but it is quiet ,clean and and well equipped. We had a very good exprerience and would highly recommend it.[QWERTY123]This is an excellent apartment in a perfect location. Close to trains and all that the neighborhood has to offer. Dani and James were great hosts and we would definitely stay here again![QWERTY123]L accueil de Dani était parfait , a l écoute et disponible pour nous indiquer les activités à faire dans le quartier ou sur Manhattan .bienque nous soyons arrivés tard elle a été disponible pour nous expliquer le fonctionnement du charmant appartement calme idéalement placé pour partir visiter Manhattan par l accès du métro à 5mn.
Brooklyn ressemble beaucoup à dès quartiers parisiens je recommande smith street pour retrouver des restos et boulangeries comme chez nous!
Bravo à dani pour son chaleureux accueil je recommande vivement .[QWERTY123]We love the Green Guest Apartment, this is out second stay! Dani is an excellent host; communicative, accommodating and friendly. The apartment itself is the perfect size us (two adults and a six year-old). The full kitchen is great for making simple meals and snacks, my son loved having his own bed on the sofa and the simple amenities (coffee, lotion, lots of fluffy towels, iron, hairdryer, book of local menus) made us feel at home. The location cannot be beat! South Park Slope is a wonderful neighborhood in and of itself but the apartment is also super-convenient to the subway to explore the rest of the city.[QWERTY123]Dani was a great host. We were arriving after midnight and she had no complaints about meeting us that late. She gave us quick and efficient  run through of the apartment. The apartment is as it appears in the photos. It is a small apartment -- almost a studio -- but pretty typical for NYC and Brooklyn. The kitchen is nice and served our needs well. The bathroom is small, but, again, everything is functional and useful. We stayed here as two adults and two kids aged 9 and 11. There was plenty of room for the kids to sleep on the fold out couch and the big bed was comfortable for us. This apartment is on a really great block in the South Slope of Brooklyn. Very convenient (5 min walk) to the trains and there were Ubers 2-3 minutes away at all times.[QWERTY123]Dani and James made us feel welcome and at home right away. We ate at a Peruvian place a few blocks away that James recommended and it was great food and a great atmosphere. The neighborhood felt safe to walk in even at 10 pm for me and my 80-year-old mom. There was everything we could possibly need and it was all easy to use and clearly explained. The bed was very comfortable and the neighborhood is quiet. We arrived from the Newark airport and Dani gave us detailed info about how to get there on public transit (which convinced us it was worth springing for a taxi!). We will definitely stay with them on our next trip![QWERTY123]Dani was very accommodating, taking extra steps in preparing for our arrival. Upon our arrival we were warmly greeted and felt very welcomed.
The rental was described very accurately in the listing.
A very nice location in the Park Slope neighborhood.
Great space for the two of us to be very comfortable with all of the necessities provided.
We hope that it is available at the time of our next visit.[QWERTY123]Staying in Manhattan is really expensive and you end up with a really small room, however if you stay with Dani you get easy access to Manhattan within 20 mins and loads of space! Plus you're already in Brooklyn which is way cooler than Manhattan anyway! The apartment is warm in the winter and has great facilities - if you're inclined you can nip over the road to a wonderfully stocked local deli and prepare a meal at home, but there are plenty of great restaurants nearby. Dani knows the area really well so she will be able to point you in a good direction.[QWERTY123]Had a perfect stay at Dani's apartment. The location and space are both amazing. Plenty of room, kitchen stocked with coffee, and a warm and welcoming host. What more could you ask for?! We will definitely be back!!![QWERTY123]The apartment exceeded our expectations. Everything was clean, well stocked and cozy. Dani was warm and welcoming and available if we needed anything. There is everything you need imaginable to make this your home away from home. It is walkable and safe, I would stay again and recommend to my family and friends.[QWERTY123]Dani's place was 10 times better then any hotel. Everything you needed was right there for you to use, if you forgot shampoo she had it, coffee, water etc. The house is also green based which was awesome, the filtered water in the shower left your skin oh so soft. I'm not much of a cook when I'm on vacation but if you are she has it all there for you, pots, pans, fridge, pantry etc. Dani answered all my questions when I had one, I didn't have much interaction with her, but that's only because I didn't need to like I said above she was fully prepared with everything on hand that I didn't need to contact her. This was a great mini vacation, I go to New York every year to visit family and I will never stay in a hotel again. Dani you have a long time customer.[QWERTY123]We had a fabulous stay. Dani was so warm and inviting. The place was comfortable and a short distance to the subway. We would be happy to stay here again.[QWERTY123]Fantastic apartment in Brooklyn! The unit is spacious, well laid out and made to feel like you're at home. Dani, the host was very sweet and accommodating.  Practically everything you need has been thought out and accounted for. Great access to the train and Park Slope's 5th avenue which has just about everything you need. As a former NYC/ Brooklyn resident for 10 years, I'm well aware of what the city has to offer and I can say you will be hard pressed to find something better.[QWERTY123]Dani was a wonderful host.  She is very knowledgeable and gave great recommendations for nearby eateries and coffee shops.  Absolutely gracious and responsive regarding any questions we had.[QWERTY123]Cozy and comfortable classic Brooklyn apartment in a central location in Park Slope. It was very easy to feel right at home here.[QWERTY123]Nous avons beaucoup apprécié notŕe séjour chez Dani. Sa maison est pleine de charme et l appartement est très bien équipé. Tout a été pensé pour que nous nous sentions à l aise et ne manquions de rien. Le quartier est calme avec de jolies maisons. Merci Dani.[QWERTY123]We stayed 3 nights at Dani s' place. Her place is very cozy and comfortable and reasonably warm at winter nights. She has a great kitchen. It is so well equipped and well maintained. 
Just next to her house are many grocery shop and tons of reasonably priced eateries. The subway station is 5 mints walk, it takes you to Manhattan to airports , very well connected and safe. I took Amy s' help to book taxi to JFK .It is highly recommended as they are very punctual and less pricey than yellow cabs.
Dani and Amy are great hosts.[QWERTY123]Dani is gracious,  responsive and makes you feel cared for. The apartment is cozy and comfortable, with high ceilings, a very comfortable bed, and a well-equipped kitchen with high quality coffee and tea.  Dani also provides lovely soaps and shampoos, as well as maps and menus from local restaurants.   The apartment is just steps from plenty of restaurants and shops, and close to the subway, but is located on a side street and faces the back garden,  so there is no street noise.  I stayed four nights while visiting family, and hope I can stay there on my next trip.[QWERTY123]Yes! What they said! Dani's place is the perfect New York bolt-hole, and possibly the best accommodation I've stayed in. I highly recommend this choice.

The apartment is spotless – I could instantly begin using the kitchen and bathroom without wincing – warm (January), bright, secure, quiet, and comfortable. 

I am finding it difficult to write this review because we seemed to slip into this accommodation with such ease that it feels too familiar – and I think this tells you something.

Dani is the type of person who, I suspect, can do anything. She does everything with grace and competence, and strikes a perfect balance between genuine friendliness and professionalism. From the moment you book or simply make an enquiry with Dani, she makes you feel confident about the arrangement, and continues to provide perfectly timed and relevant information throughout your stay.

Dani and James combine a steadfast commitment to social justice and the environment with an easygoing approach. They’ve carved out a tranquil niche in a big, tough city, and it’s a privilege to experience a little piece of that.

Park Slope is a good area, with a mix of amenities, including excellent restaurants. The apartment is close to the subway station. Manhattan is a short ride away, as is the rest of Brooklyn, which should not be viewed as a second-best to Manhattan!
[QWERTY123]Five stars as always! I would give ten stars if I could. Dani and her family exemplify the community spirit of Airbnb. The PSGG apartment is extraordinarily well stocked; immaculately clean; very close to all public transportation, not to mention the numerous bars and restaurants of Park Slope; and best of all, it comes with extraordinarily friendly, considerate, and fun hosts! We lived not three blocks from Dani and her family until five years ago, and this is our new home away from home when we're back in our 'hood. The only problem is, it's always booked! If you ever find this gem available, don't hesitate. You won't be sorry, and you'll definitely enjoy your organic coffee in the mornings![QWERTY123]Dani's place is just lovely. It is clean, quiet, centrally located and just as described. The bed is comfortable with great linens, the tub and shower are perfect and the kitchen is ideal. Dani was friendly and accommodating and made extra efforts to make me feel at home. I highly recommend it and hope to return myself.[QWERTY123]My in-laws stayed at Dani's place while visiting us and they had a wonderful stay. They described her place as ""sweet"" and ""darling"" and they are eager to stay there again. Dani was flexible and accommodating and a pleasure to deal with.[QWERTY123]One of the best Airbnb experiences I've ever had. House was perfect for travelers![QWERTY123]A charming and homey apartment, especially suited for guests who care about the environment.[QWERTY123]Dani is a very pleasant and friendly host, she did her best to help.

The apartment is spotless, spacious and very well equipped for a short or a long stay.
Perfect location: very close to 3 subway lines, tons of restaurants in the area, a short walk from all types of shops and groceries. 

Staying at Dani's place was one of my best experience in NY with airbnb. I really felt at home and definitely plan on staying here again.

Thanks again Dani for your warm welcome! I really enjoyed my cups of coffee in the morning :)


[QWERTY123]Wonderful stay...Dani went above and beyond with communication, working with me to make sure that check in was seamless. She also took the time to introduce herself and show us around the apartment. Great space near tons of restaurants, nightlife, parks, etc--but also on a side street, so not noisy. We loved![QWERTY123]Fantastic! This is a great space in an awesome neighborhood in Brooklyn. Close proximity to subway, restaurants, bars, coffee shops, etc.  Easy to get to Barclays Center and a short subway ride into Manhattan. Space was very clean and pull out sofa was comfortable. Parking was a little difficult to find when we arrived but not too bad. Parking seems to be easier to find in the evenings between 4-6pm. Dani was a great host and was very responsive to questions. I would love to be able to stay here again in the future![QWERTY123]Staying at Dani's flat has been a wondeful experience. The appartement is really nice and conveniently located in a really nice neighborhood (Park Slope), not very far from the city center (20 min ride with the tube). Dani is a wonderful host, helped us to commute from the airport and gave us a few tips about New York and the good places around the flat. Thank you again Dani. See you soon![QWERTY123]Dani is a great host - you have to check in and out with the host (for keys and other logistics) which can be a little inconvenient for some but she is so friendly and to the point and so accomodating and friendly so it is a very worthwhile place to stay - especially if you are chemical free/green/highly allergic.  My stepmom and really enjoyed our stay - thanks for everything Dani!![QWERTY123]This is an excellent place to stay. It is spacious bright and clean and in a great location. Dani is a wonderful host and was very helpful and accommodating. Would stay here again.[QWERTY123]Dani's place was great! We had 4 people in our reservation and had plenty of room. The beds were comfy. The apartment was clean. The noise level outside was nonexistent. We had such a great experience at Dani's and hope to be back soon...if her place is ever found available again![QWERTY123]This place is wonderful and close to many great spots. It was very clean and cozy, and the hosts are excellent! We will definitely stay here again![QWERTY123]Dani's place is far better than we even imagined.  The flat is  cozy and light, with losts of room.  The flat is nicely situated: in a nice neighborhood,  close to the park and the subway.  Dani is super nice and has created a really warm and welcoming atmosphere.  The flat is very well stocked and has all sorts of conveniences.  I highly recommend staying at Dani's place.[QWERTY123]Dani's place is a home-away-from-home. The kitchen is fully equipped, the place is spotless, the neighborhood friendly. There is a market a two minute walk away and a subway five minutes away. The park is 10 minutes or less.
Dani is friendly and helpful and a great host.
We loved our stay here and will stay again if the opportunity arises.[QWERTY123]Dani's place is a great find! Dani herself is very welcoming and nice. She let us in herself when we arrived and even gave us fresh coffee to use. We had our friends with us and she gave us spare keys for them as well. The apartment was very nice and clean. It was spacious and comfortable. The bed was great and there is plenty of closet space. We fit four adults, a toddler and a baby and it did not feel cramped. There is a full kitchen (including a coffee grinder for freshly ground beans!) and the bathroom was very clean (with plenty of nice, soft towels). We couldn't be happier with our stay at Dani's. We highly recommend it for couples or families![QWERTY123]I highly recommend Dani's place.  Dani was very helpful.  Apartment was charming and very clean.[QWERTY123]Wir haben uns vom ersten Augenblick richtig wohl gefuehlt! Der Kontakt mit Dani war auch im Vorfeld der Reise schon super und sie stand uns mit vielen Tipps zur Seite. Das Appartment war blitzsauber, das Bett ist bequem (auch fuer Leute, die gerne auf eher harten Matratzen schlafen!), es gab super Kaffee und auch andere Labensmittel zur Verwendung. Ich war sehr froh, die Unterkunft in Brooklyn gewaehlt zu haben. So haben wir neben dem doch eher hektischen Manhattan auch ein Viertel kennengelernt, wo ganz ""normale"" Menschen/Familien leben und ein Gefuehl fuer das Alltagsleben in der Neighborhood bekommen. Was man als Reisender beim ersten Besuch im grossartigen New York bedenken sollte, sind die riesigen Entfernungen, die man fuer die Besuche bei all den wahnsinnig aufregenden Must-See's zuruecklegen muss. Die U-Bahn ist zwar wirklich nicht weit (ca. 10 Min.) und man ist in ca. 20 Min. in Manhattan,aber man kann auch locker mehr als 1 Std. brauchen, um dorthin zu gelangen, wo man hinmoechte. Dafuer also immer Zeit einplanen :o)
 Das Apartment kann ich wirklich weiterempfehlen!!!![QWERTY123]Dani is so nice and helpful and the apartment was perfect! Clean, cozy, and right where we needed to be. It's nice and eco-freindly too so you feel good about not making much waste at all :) I would definitely come here again![QWERTY123]Great place.   As advertised.[QWERTY123]It was easy to get around from Dani's apartment. She was friendly and helpful and always willing to attend to any question or needs that we had.[QWERTY123]Muchas gracias por hacer perfecta nuestra estadía. Nos sentimos muy cómodos y todo era perfecto. A pocas distancia está la estación de metro y en la cercanía hay comercios de todo tipo. Seguro que volveríamos sin dudarlo.[QWERTY123]Dani is a great host. She greeted us and showed us around. The apartment is cozy and has everything we needed for two people. Location is perfect, quiet street and easy to get around town[QWERTY123]Great location, near great bars and restaurants, very close to subway[QWERTY123]My boyfriend and I came to Brooklyn for a wedding during Memorial Day weekend. Dani gave us clear directions to take the A and F train from Penn station to her home as opposed to trying to find a cab or Uber which was the most cost effective. Her home is conveniently located to the 5th Ave where there are plenty of restaurants and bars. She gave sound recommendations for local coffee and restaurants. Had a great time, would definitely stay again.[QWERTY123]Dani is a great hostess! Bright,clean place was a perfect base for visiting our Brooklyn kids and seeing the city. Convenient subway access a plus!! Very cozy, quiet neighborhood. Convenient laundromat around the corner. We'll be back![QWERTY123]Dani's place was very clean and comfortable. The apartment had everything we needed as international travellers. Subway, bars, restaurants, supermarkets all within walking distance. Dani was also very easy to communicate with. I would highly recommend Dani's place.[QWERTY123]Clean, Roomy, and Comfortable 

We felt quite at home here.  The apartment was surprisingly roomy quite a step up from hotels we've stayed at in the past.  

Central to popular and family friendly Park Slope area. 

Loved that the rental was a green apartment. Very well stocked with eco-friendly and conscious products :-)   

Wonderful, organic, not too expensive Grocery store and laundry were close by, as well as delicious restaurants.  Dani was so very helpful. We really enjoyed Dani's recommendation to visit Cafe Regular.  

Brooklyn is a destination within itself. 
We enjoyed excellent rustic Italian at Lilia in Williamsburg,  rooftop cinema, and headed to the city for dinner and a day out :-).  We will definitely come back to stay again.[QWERTY123]Die Unterkunft von Dani ist perfekt, es hat an nichts gefehlt. Das Apparment ist sehr, sehr sauber und zentral an vielen Restaurants und Bars gelegen (5th Avenue direkt ums Eck). Für uns war Brooklyn die beste Wahl, denn NY City bzw. Manhatten ist uns viel zu laut, aggressiv und hektisch. In Brooklyn lernt man das normale Leben kennen, inkl. vieler Bars mit Live Music und einer tollen Nachbarschaft. Dani und ihre Familie sind sehr herzlich und standen uns von Anfang an mit Rat und Tat zur Seite. Wenn wir wieder nach Brooklyn kommen sollten, dann würden wir definitiv wieder bei Dani wohnen wollen.[QWERTY123]When we reserved, we didn't realize that we were staying is what turned out to be a full one-bedroom apartment that is fully equipped. The place was great -- comfortable, convenient, and clean. We would not hesitate to recommend to friends, and will stay again ourselves next time to the Big Apple.[QWERTY123]Dani is a pleasant and attentive host and the place is just as described.  It is neat, clean, comfortable and close to restaurants, shops and the subway station.  You will not regret your decision to book this venue.[QWERTY123]Great experience all around.[QWERTY123]This is a nice, clean place in residential area. Dani is a really good host. We enjoyed our vacations there.[QWERTY123]The location, comfort and price made Dani's place a real value for us.  Key for me is a comfortable bed which is what I got.  A special thank you to Dani for receiving my lost luggage when it arrived and letting me know when it arrived.[QWERTY123]We really enjoyed our stay and felt comfortable staying at Dani's place. The location is great with a lot of restaurants and shops nearby and an easy access to the train stations.
Thanks a lot![QWERTY123]Dani is a really great host, available, hospitable and helpful in every way. The apartment was perfect for myself and my two kids. We were very comfortable there. It was well stocked. The apartment is also very convenient-- 3 blocks from the subway and just across the street from the corner store (both of which were important for someone with young kids!). I would definitely come back![QWERTY123]Great apartment with a very kind host. Happy to stay again anytime![QWERTY123]This was our second stay in Dani's guest house, and it was just as delightful as the first. We love the neighborhood, and Dani is a fantastic host. Her apartment is clean, comfortable and well appointed for our needs. We used to stay in Manhattan during our biennial jaunts to New York, but now that we have experienced Brooklyn, I can't imaging staying anywhere else.[QWERTY123]We are struggling to find ways to sing Dani's praises that we have not already written in the past.  We can hardly believe it is our 5th time staying at Dani's wonderful apartment.  It has become our yearly summer routine.  We don't even bother to look elsewhere.  We feel it is such a privilege to be able to stay at Dani's - to even find an opening.  This year we even changed our schedule in order to do so. It is just that great a place to stay.

You cannot find a family of better quality, a location that is safer,  cleaner, quiet and yet in the thick of all things - a block from the subway/bus.  1/2 a block from groceries with lots of organic choices.  A few blocks from pizza that takes a back seat to none - Peppino's, The Lady Bird Bakery, The Bagel Pub, 7th Ave. Donuts & Diner & The Little Purity for a great breakfast, burger and good old fashioned style flavorful donuts.....the list goes on.  There are no clunkers in the bunch.  It's great to have all the essentials close by in case the weather turns.  There is also a great insta-care doctors office and many pharmacies close by - this time we had need of both.

Just stand on Dani's steps- open your Yelp App.  You will be blown away by all of the top rated eateries/businesses, etc. - literally something for everyone within just a 5 minute walk.....and what a great neighborhood to take walks!  If for some reason due to weather or other causes, you were to become stranded, you would be content to be stranded in this area and lack for nothing.

We cannot think of a single negative thing - we would change nothing!  How unusual is that?

Thank you so much Dani for another perfect stay. We know good things don't last forever.....but until it comes to an end, we will be a repeat customer for as long as you will have us.[QWERTY123]L'appartement correspond bien aux photos, voir même plus grand en vrai !
Il y a le nécessaire pour se préparer les tout premiers repas (riz, pâtes, Œufs...).
Dani est au petit soins pour ses hôtes et à penser à tout. Elle fournit le café, les produits de toilettes et change plusieurs fois les serviettes de toilettes pendant le séjour.
Le mari de Dani nous a accueillit, il est également très sympas!
Ils sont disponibles pour répondre à nos questions et Dani nous a même réservé le taxi pour le retour !
Le quartier est calme, agréable et malgré tout proche de Manhattan, a recommander !!
Nous avons passer un agréable séjour, merci à Dani et son mari pour cet accueil chaleureux, nous avons apprécié notre séjour chez vous!![QWERTY123]comfortable, spacious, and well-located, plus Dani is very welcoming[QWERTY123]The photos and descriptions of Dani's place are spot on.  It is a great base for exploring the city and feels like home. (Plus coffee, tea, and toiletries were stocked )[QWERTY123]Our stay at Dani's apartment was wonderful! It was very clean and had great amenities. It's close to Prospect Park, the Subway, bars and restaurants. Dani was great with communication and gave us some great area recommendations. I hope to stay there again if we're back in Brooklyn![QWERTY123]Dani's place was great!  Very comfortable and clean inside.  Walkable neighborhood near the subway.  The parking situation was much easier than I was expecting.  Definitely looking forward to a return trip sometime.[QWERTY123]Dani's place is a calm, comfortable, cozy hideaway in a neighborhood full of places to explore and an easy subway ride to Manhattan. Dani has quite a few tips to help people enjoy their stay. Dani really is a superhost![QWERTY123]Enjoyed the stay at Dani's place. It's location was close to the subway station and not too far from Prospect Park. If you're going to Brooklyn for a weekend, I'd recommend staying at Dani's. Great host and she has a ton of recommendations for any newbies to the area! :)[QWERTY123]Dani and James were wonderful! Apartment was very clean! Great location for our weekend in manhattan. Short walk to subway. All amenities close by. Lots of extras in apartment-gave it a real homey feel! We will definitely return![QWERTY123]Dani's apartment is well equipped with everything you need and is exactly as described in the listing. It’s located in a lovely neighbourhood with some great restaurants and bars nearby, and the beautiful park just a few blocks away. The subway into Manhattan is quick and easy, and this is the perfect base for exploring the city. Dani was very welcoming, and we appreciated her flexibility about our late arrival and letting us leave bags after checkout. We would definitely recommend Dani’s apartment, and would love to stay there again.[QWERTY123]We could not have asked for a better experience. Dani was a wonderful and accommodating host, her apartment exceeded our expectations and was a joy to stay in. Highly recommend![QWERTY123]It was an amazing experience staying at Dani's place. We decided to stay at her place because of the location. However we got more than our money's worth by not only being in a centrally located place in park slope but her hospitality. I found her to go above and beyond my experience with other host. If I get another chance to pass by NYC, I will decently stay at Dani's place again.[QWERTY123]My husband and I had a fantastic stay here!  Dani and James were great hosts.  We had easy communication, and the space was just perfect for my husband and I.  The apartment was clean, very spacious, great light throughout and within easy walking distance from the subway.  Also, they were very kind about holding our luggage before and after the check in time, which was very helpful for us.  Would highly recommend![QWERTY123]Loved staying at Dani and James! Very comfortable, great location and one of the sweetest hosts I've stayed with; would definitely stay with them again.[QWERTY123]Die Wohnung ist sehr günstig an der U-Bahn gelegen, ca. 7 Gehminuten entfernt. Von dort kommt man sehr schnell nach Manhattan (ungefähr 25 Minuten zum Times Square), eine Fahrt kostet p.P. 3 Dollar und es pendeln ständig Bahnen. Vorsicht: In den Waggons wird sehr stark heruntergekühlt. Gerade im Sommer ein echter Kontrast zur Außentemperatur.
Auch gut: In unmittelbarer Näher (ca. 5 Gehminuten) ein kleiner Supermarkt, in dem man alles für's Frühstück (und darüber hinaus) bekommen kann. Außerdem ein paar Bistros, in denen man frühstücken, zu Mittag oder zu Abend essen kann.
Die Gastgeberin Dani ist sehr nett und hat mit Rat und Tat geholfen.[QWERTY123]We have stayed at Dani’s place several times while visiting New York City over a period of more than five years. We have always been highly satisfied with all the very positive aspects of our stays at Dani’s place. The neighborhood and location have been ideal. Communication with Dani is effortless. She is a very warm and friendly host. We try to visit NYC at least once a year, and we will continue to book Dani’s place whenever it is available for our travels.[QWERTY123]Dani runs a very efficient Airbnb setup. Nestled in residential park slope (aka Sesame Street) Dani was communicative and is obviously a veteran hostess with the amenities, guides, and ease of operation.  Great stay and will be back.[QWERTY123]My husband and I had a wonderful stay at Dani's apartment! We arrived before check in time and Dani let us to leave our bags so we could begin exploring the city. Dani is very kind, was a great communicator about check in, and was very helpful with advice once we got there regarding directions and local areas. The apartment was very nice and clean. We thought it was quite spacious for a one bedroom in the city. The neighborhood is family friendly with lots of restaurants and coffee shops nearby. The subway was nearby as well so we could get into Manhattan. Overall we had a great experience and would highly recommend Dani's apartment to others![QWERTY123]Thank you Dani for making our stay in NYC so amazing. Thank you for the warm welcome you provided us and our kids. We appreciated that you were always on hand to help with any questions. The apartment had everything we needed. It was in a great location and at least for the week we felt like real Brooklyn locals![QWERTY123]Wir haben uns in Dani's Unterkunft vom ersten Moment an sehr wohl gefühlt und wurden sehr herzlich empfangen!
Die Ausstattung lässt nichts zu wünschen übrig und auch die Lage in einer ruhigen und kinderfreundlichen Gegend war genau das Richtige für uns. Sowohl die Subway-Station als auch verschiedene Einkaufsmöglichkeiten, Bars und Restaurants sind innerhalb weniger Minuten zu Fuß zu erreichen. Nach Downtown Manhatten sollte man mit der Subway ca. 20 Min einplanen. 
Dani war eine sehr hilfsbereite und freundliche Gastgeberin. Sowohl vor als auch während unseres Aufenthaltes war sie jeder Zeit für Fragen erreichbar. 
Wir sind sehr froh, Dani als Gastgeberin gehabt zu haben und würden auch nächstes Mal gerne bei ihr wohnen wollen! :)[QWERTY123]This was an overall awesome experience! If we ever come back to NYC then we will definitely stay here again![QWERTY123]Great location and terrific apartment. Dani was in touch to help me settle in and made me feel very welcome. A very well-supplied and comfortable apartment.[QWERTY123]This is a comfortable, quiet apartment on the edge of one of Brooklyn's famous brownstone neighborhoods, Park Slope. It is very conveniently located to the subway; two useful lines, the R and the F, are a couple of short streets away. There are many small ethic and local restaurants nearby.

Dani is lovely and a good host. Communication was good and when something came up, she was wonderfully flexible. 

Check in was easy, the bed is comfortable, the WiFi good. 
If you want to see the New York that is the place that ""real New Yorkers"" live, find it in Brooklyn, at Dani's place.

Highly recommend.[QWERTY123]We could not have been any happier with this stay.  Dani was a great host and the location was fantastic.  We had a great time and can’t wait to get a chance to stay there again!![QWERTY123]Very nice one bedroom apartment in a fun part of Brooklyn, welcoming and helpful host, hard to beat.  Would happily return.[QWERTY123]Thanks so much for great hospitality Dani--we had a wonderful stay at your place![QWERTY123]Dani’s Park Slope apt is beautiful, comfortable, immaculate, and located in a wonderful Brooklyn neighborhood. The kitchen is fully equipped with everything you may need. She is a very accommodating host and I would definitely come back.[QWERTY123]Good location-near restaurants, others stores. Dani was helpful and accommodating.[QWERTY123]Not only is Dani’s place great, but so is she. It makes all the difference to be greeted warmly and graciously into a new environment. The apartment is all it’s described to be. It’s very clean and quiet, and the neighborhood is great. Very close to the subway. The only thing I would have wanted that wasn’t there was a microwave. On the other hand, she is true to her description of the place as “green,” which I totally respect. I hope to have the opportunity to stay there again.[QWERTY123]Dani is really kind host. she is really thoughtful, I really touched about her consideration. for example she prepare everything for our convenient accommodation.

If you’re visiting NYC or Brooklyn this is a great place to stay![QWERTY123]I can say it is everything it says it is on Dani's listing, and then some. It is very environmentally friendly and there are many extras that came with the stay. It was very quiet and private. The host spendt time with us when we arrived, answered all of our questions about transportation, local restaurants, etc. We visited several restaurants close by, they were exceptional. The people in the area in general are very friendly and helpful. I highly recommend this unit. 
Good luck,
Ronny[QWERTY123]Dani is a wonderful host. All the amenities are there, and she is always quick to respond. My wife and 3-year old daughter stayed here for five days and it was ideal--food and coffee, and subway all close by. Very highly recommended.[QWERTY123]Dani is one in a million. She’s thoughtful, communicative, engaged, kind, and so dependable you’ll feel like you’re staying with a longtime family friend. This is the second time we’ve stayed with Dani and we would love to stay again whenever we can return to nyc. Dani’s place is perfect for our little family of three and equipped with everything we need, but more importantly Dani’s warmth makes us feel completely at home- what more could you want from a host? If I could give her 50 stars instead of 5, I would!![QWERTY123]This was our second stay at Dani’s. I don’t know how she does it, but she just does.

I wrote a review one year ago (January 2017). I hope you can read it!

I continue to highly recommend this apartment. It’s the perfect place to stay in New York, and I always sleep so well there! It feels like home the first time you are there. Oh, I’m telling stories now. It’s much cleaner than my home. 

Dani is ever-gracious, genuine, and brilliant, and James smiles a lot and knows a thing or two about politics.

There is no doubt that Dani is doing something special, and I hope she knows that.  
[QWERTY123]Great place, great host![QWERTY123]Dani was wonderful! Quick to respond and offer suggestions! The apartment was fantastic, and I loved all the organic products available! Location was great![QWERTY123]Location is terrific , Dani was quick to respond to any issues . I would definitely stay at Dani’s  place again[QWERTY123]Dani made us feel welcome and added a number of personal touches to make our stay there very pleasant. Comfortable bed, quiet neighborhood. Thank you Dani![QWERTY123]Great place! Host was key for this as my flight got delayed over 2 hours and I arrived at 1:30AM. Dani was there to greet me and show me the place. The place is great and close to the subway[QWERTY123]The Location could not have been better for us![QWERTY123]Dani hosted my very close family friends who were visiting for a family event.  They arrived very late from the airport and Dani was completely flexible and accommodating.  They told me that everything they needed was there--coffee, linens, etc.  They are a big family and Dani was extremely kind and helpful in making sure that they felt welcome and comfortable.[QWERTY123]This is an excellent place to stay! My friend and i loved our time. The neighborhood was quiet and nice but a very short and easy walk to great bars and restaurants! The apartment itself is very clean, nice, and comfortable and Dani is super sweet! 10/10 would return![QWERTY123]Dani's apartment is very clean, the bed is comfortable, and the location is great.

Sin duda, en mi próxima visita a NY, vuelvo a hospedarme con Dani.[QWERTY123]My daughter and I had a wonderful stay at Dani’s place. The apartement is great, fully furnished and with all the little things you usually don’t have in rentals (soaps, shampoos, cooking supplies...). It is very convenientely located, in the heart of Park Slope and a 3 minutes walk to the subway. 
Everything was perfect and Dani is great.[QWERTY123]I stayed at Dani's place for ten nights and the experience was easy and efficient.

Dani was very responsive.[QWERTY123]Park Slope Delight!
A wonderfully welcoming experience to the brownstones of Brooklyn.  Dani welcomed my friends from Australia to their first Airbnb experience.  Her accomodation is spacious and well appointed.  Its proximity to Prospect Park and Brooklyn Botanical Gardens is a bonus.  There is easy access to Manhattan via the subway. There is a myriad of local cafes, restaurants, and bars from which to choose.  The highlight is the friendliest host with assistance and advice on all travel needs when exploring NYC.  Many fond memories of this stay![QWERTY123]Dani was an amazing host. She was easy to reach and proactively communicated as needed. The space was awesome. Spacious, clean, and quiet. I would definitely rebook![QWERTY123]Dani is amazingly hospitable. We wanted to catch a matinee, which started around our check in time; Dani took our bags early, carried them to the space, and even provided suggestions on where to park. The neighborhood is great with a quick walk to the subway station. We would definitely stay there again.[QWERTY123]NA[QWERTY123]Dani's place is fantastic! It's clean, quiet and in a perfect location in Park Slope. Dani was quick to respond and communicated very well. She does a great job managing the property and ensuring that those who stay there have a great experience. I highly recommend it![QWERTY123]Dani is a great host - so thoughtful, responsive, and thorough. Her place was exactly what we needed for our couple days in Brooklyn![QWERTY123]I was in town for a quick family event in the neighborhood and Dani's place was perfect for it!  Everything was in walking distance, great access to prospect park and terrific restaurants.  I would definitely stay again!!  Thanks Dani![QWERTY123]Dani is a great host with a comfy apt with lots of friendly amenities. Apt is bright and sunny.[QWERTY123]Dani's place is AMAZING! It's clean, cozy and comfortable. She made checking in and out a breeze. The neighborhood is fantastic. We thoroughly enjoyed walking to restaurants, markets and bars. It was a quick and easy Lyft ride to get to other neighborhoods we wanted to explore. I absolutely plan to stay here again on my next visit to the city.[QWERTY123]This is a lovely, clean, cozy, and very conveniently located apartment.  Dani is a wonderful host, answered all of our questions yet respected our privacy during our stay.[QWERTY123]This is a great home in a great area of Brooklyn. The space itself has everything you need (including a full kitchen) as well as an onsite homeowner. The location is close to shops, restaurants, and public transportation but is on a lovely tree-lined street. All in all, this is a fantastic place to stay![QWERTY123]It was nice to hear from the owner the day before and the day of arrival and her husband was there to explain keys and show us the apartment. 

They went out of their way to have most of what travelers need: soap, shampoo, tea, coffee and a coffee pot and a hot pot for just water. Filtered water at the sink was really great and there was a pitcher of it in the fridge as well. 

The building was really quiet, day and night. There’s a little organic grocery a half block away.  Location is good, in the South Park Slope area. 

Dani has menus from local restaurants and magazines about the area to look at. There’s free WiFi and even a computer for guests to use. All in all, a nice place to stay when you want a homey place rather than a hotel.[QWERTY123]Super clean and convenient apartment  to stay in Brooklyn Park Slope neighborhood! Lots of extras- coffee, juice and bath products. I really enjoyed the space (family of 3) and would recommend this Airbnb to anyone.[QWERTY123]This is our 6th stay at Dani’s Brooklyn apartment.  The fact there are so many choices yet we have continually opted to always stay with Dani expresses far more than many words can say.   Dani’s Brooklyn apartment allows you to experience what it is like to actually live in and be a part of this very charming section of Brooklyn.  We used to stay in Manhattan and at times Brooklyn Heights but soon discovered what a treat it is to stay in a walkable neighborhood - even late at night - a neighborhood that is complete in itself and lacks nothing.  Foot steps from everything “essential” - groceries/regular and organic, Peppino’s Pizza- and so many other great eateries of every sort - all within walking distance, R, F & G trains around the corner....a timely bus 1/2 a block away.....there is nothing lacking.  How often can you say that?  More importantly Dani, James and their family are true contributors to their community.  They have a tremendous sense of duty and live by their values - which can at times be  very hard work and requires much self sacrifice on their part.  They are noble and trust worthy in character - again how often do you find that these days?  Without hesitation, choose to stay with Dani and you will have not regrets. Thanks again Dani for another perfect stay![QWERTY123]Dani's apartment is very well located in a beautiful neighborhood of Brooklyn. It is in very good condition and has everything you need to spend a few days in New York. Although we could not meet him personally, the people who were in his place treated us very well.[QWERTY123]We have stayed at Dani’s place probably five times over the past six years. As always, it was an excellent experience. Every detail was perfect. We would always choose Dani’s apartment for our stays in New York, given the opportunity.[QWERTY123]Todo como indica las fotos, buena comunicación y trato inmejorable repetiría sin dudarlo[QWERTY123]Great enviroment, quite but close to public transformation. Host was especially kind and helpful, nice experience.[QWERTY123]Full 5 stars. Great place to hand your hat. Dani is a sweerheart.[QWERTY123]Dani is great. The place is perfect and pleasant with a great location. 5 stars![QWERTY123]Everything went smoothly with our stay in Dani’s comfy rental. We were traveling with an 18 month old and Dani setup the pack and play for us because we got in late. We took advantage of having Sesame Street on demand and appreciated the chocolates that she prepared for us. The location was close to the subway and there were stores and restaurants conveniently located nearby. Dani was super responsive and even allowed us to store our luggage after we checked out. Highly recommended![QWERTY123]Dani’s apartment is in a friendly neighbourhood with lots of shops and good restaurants in the area. The apartment is spacious and the perfect spot to relax after a day of sightseeing. Dani was extremely helpful and accommodating of our needs especially when checking in and leaving at the end of our memorable vacation.[QWERTY123]We loved our stay at Dani’s apartment she was a great host and was very accommodating for us. Her attention to detail with the amenities was appreciated.  It’s a really nice location close to good restaurants, bars and the subway. We would definitely recommend to others.[QWERTY123]We thought this was a lovely place to stay, not far from subway, good breakfast places, host so kind and welcoming, clean and well equipped.[QWERTY123]Dani's apartment is a great place to stay in Brooklyn. It's near Prospect Park, lots of restaurants, and mass transportation. The icing on the cake is that this is a green apartment![QWERTY123]Park Slope is a wonderful neighborhood that is very walkable and scenic. This apartment is quiet and comfortable with many special touches such as gourmet coffee and a binder full of restaurant menus. It is just steps away from shops and restaurants. The subway to Manhattan is a 5 minute walk away. Dani is a friendly host with great restaurant and coffeeshop recommendations. I would definitely stay here again![QWERTY123]We really enjoyed our stay and will be returning. It’s in a great neighborhood and a stone’s throw from the R train. Also super close to Barclays/Atlantic ave which made it easy to transfer to other trains. It’s fully stocked with toiletries and delicious coffee. Walking distance to great restaurants. The space itself is lovely - an old building with crown molding and a claw foot tub, but still has modern day comforts such as air conditioning. Can’t wait to return![QWERTY123]Dani is a gracious host who readily answers your messages and questions.  Her place is the perfect place to relax and recharge for the next day’s activities.  The place is clean and welcoming with plenty of space to spread out your things.  It’s only a few blocks from the subway and there is a variety of places to eat or grab delicious coffee to start your day.  I’ll definitely check out Dani’s place again  the next time I’m in the area![QWERTY123]A great place to stay in Brooklyn. Easy walking and subway access. This area is a bit more quiet than some neighborhoods but still tons of stuff to do. Dani and her husband were very nice and welcoming - fun to talk to, too! 
The apartment had everything we needed. It was cozy and a relaxing place to rest at the end of our busy days. Extra bonus for the coffee that we enjoyed every day![QWERTY123]Terrific location.  Terrific host.  Terrific apartment.  Quiet and comfortable.  And I had great sleep, which is so important!  I would love to stay here again upon any future return to Park Slope, Brooklyn.[QWERTY123]This is a GEM of a location right in Park Slope, Brooklyn. The apartment is on the second floor and overlooks a backyard area so the feel is private and cozy. It was immaculate and comfortable, with little touches like a computer for guest use, little signs offering tips/instructions for the TV and WiFi, and pantry staples such as tea and coffee (as well as some items in the fridge). Dani and her family live downstairs and she was very communicative and prompt with her responses via text for anything we might have needed. Although we were relatively familiar with NYC and didn't need ""guidebook"" help, she does offer a selection of local guides and pamphlets for your visit and we heard her recommending some neighborhood spots to the guests who were coming in for their visit after we left, so I'm sure she'd be helpful in that arena as well! You are steps from the F, G and R trains as well as a cute organic corner store, several restaurants and coffee shops, and Prospect Park. We even lucked out and got street parking right outside the front door...unheard of, and such a good sign for how easy and enjoyable our visit was :) We appreciated that the place functions with a ""green"" viewpoint and recycling/composting are encouraged. With a young baby in tow, this was the perfect spot for my family to relax and have a home base for our NYC trip...highly recommend!"	40.66853475288704	-73.98911600685754	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/26785	3	135.0	0.85

Thank you![QWERTY123]Wonderful stay at this place. very clean and convienent to everything (train and shopping) would definitely stay here again.[QWERTY123]Had a great stay. Adreinne was great. Subway was super close.[QWERTY123]Had a great stay at Adreinne's! Her apartment was very nice, tidy, and less than a block from the subway. She was an awesome host, very flexible, and extremely understanding toward our odd time schedule. We felt very at home here! The neighborhood offered us a peak into the Brooklyn culture. Thank you! Would do it again![QWERTY123]the apartment was great! very cosy and had everything we needed! plus, it was literally a block away from the subway station, talk about convenience! adreinne was very helpful and had everything in order for us when we arrived and again when we left. definitely recommended! I had a lovely time in brooklyn thanks to her place![QWERTY123]The apartment was steps from the subway and close to many small shops for grabbing some food or groceries. We stayed here with a family of four (two university-aged students). The main (double?) bed was very comfortable, but the pull-out couch and bed-couch we less so. If you want a place out of the city but still very commutable, this worked very well.[QWERTY123]Thanks for a good stay, Adreinne.  The apartment is very charming and clean as well as super close to the subway.  Handling check-in and check-out was a breeze.  Everything was great![QWERTY123]This was my first experience with airbnb, and Adreinee's Charming Brownstone was perfect for our week-long stay. Big, well decorated, full kitchen and bath, ample closet and dresser space. It's just half a block from the C-Line which takes you to Manhattan and Rockaway Beach. Most of the friends we were visiting lived within 5-10 blocks which also made the apartment super convenient, and they were all very impressed with the quality for the price. Jorge and Adreinne were both very helpful. 

The bedroom was a little noisy, facing the street, but tourist exhaustion + drink each night made that easy to deal with. I would stay here again in a heartbeat.[QWERTY123]Nice apartment, clean, easily accessible, and beautifully decorated with all the amenities we need. The only thing to note is that the location might be a little noisy for a light sleeper.

Thanks Adreinne.[QWERTY123]Adreinne's apartment in Brooklyn is perfect. It's exactly as nice as you can see in the photos... even better! Never seen Adreinne, but she gave us clear and specific instructions, and answered quickly to every questions.... The price is also very good and the location too... quiet, safe... the subway station it's around the corner... downtown Manhattan it's a 15 minutes ride... around 30 minutes to midtown and central park... I highly recommend this place![QWERTY123]We all really enjoyed staying in this place. Its right across from the subway station and very easy to get around from. We never saw Adreinne but she had everything set up for us so it wasn't an issue. All in all a very nice place to stay in Brooklyn.[QWERTY123]Our stay at the Brownstone went well. The place is very similar to the pictures, the subway is right across the street, and it's very spacious for two (or I imagine, even up to 4 people). 

Because the subway and bus stop are right outside the window, it is extremely loud! We turned on the fan and took some Tylenol PMs to help. If you are a light sleeper, I would not suggest this place. 

Adreinne was easy to contact through our stay when we had trouble with the heat. She was very helpful and kind. Thanks![QWERTY123]Communication from Adreinne was very good and prompt.  We were 2 adults and 2 children (one of which was a baby) and we stayed for 8 nights.  

Location
Directly opposite the subway station with a shuttle to Prospect Park is very convenient.  There wasn't much by way of places to go or hangout in the exact neighbourhood.  A few blocks down Fulton there was a place called the Outpost, and down Franklin across Fulton we noticed a nice looking Espresso bar on our last day.   If you are looking for a place to lay your head at night while exploring NY, then location isn't a huge issue.

The Apartment
It's very much like the photos.  However when we arrived it was not clean.  There were bed linens left in a cupboard, so I made up the beds.  I opened a window to air the place and was overwhelmed with dust balls flying through the place.  Under the bed, around the furniture etc. It had been some time since this place had been given a good cleaning.  Adreinne was very responsive when I contacted her, she sent her assistant Paul who came a couple of hours later and did some cleaning.  He was a very nice chap and even offered to go get me some bottled water.  

This apartment is up 3 flights of stairs.  Not a problem for able bodied people.  I arrived alone with baby, stroller and large suitcase.  Adreinne very kindly asked her neighbour below who came along and carried up my case.  It was also no problem leaving the stroller in the hall below.

Overall Adreinnes place is a good choice.  It's reasonably priced and the location opposite the subway is ideal if you're exploring the city.[QWERTY123]Paul was gracious and allowed us to enter the apartment 1 1/2 hours earlier than he expected us.  He still needed to do some cleaning up but he was pleasant and conversational while he did it.  He showed us the ""plumbing problem"" which was that you had to turn the shower on with a pair of channel lock pliers.  He said they were waiting for a part but from the looks of those rusty pliers, I think they had been waiting for a very long time.  Both my husband and myself were nearly scalded the next morning trying to adjust the water temperature with those pliers.  By the end of our 4 night visit we had it figured out but I do hope if you stay here, they have this fixed.  The apartment is quite noisy because it is on the street.  If you close the french doors to the bedroom, you will have a relatively quiet night.  However if like my daughter, you have to sleep on the couch in the living room, you will not get much sleep.  The apartment is right on the street and across from an all night bus stop as well as an elevated train.  The kitchen was nice to have for fixing meals and everything was clean.  The bathroom is big and spacious.  The french doors that separate the bedroom from the main living area are glass so don't count on any privacy if there are more than two of you staying in this apartment.  The apartment is convenient to subways that go directly into Manhattan and though a very busy area of Brooklyn, we felt relatively safe.  You do have to unlock and re-lock 5 locks using 4 keys to get into and out of the apartment so if someone was actually trying to molest you in any way, you would never get into the apartment fast enough to get away![QWERTY123]Nice apartment was east to get to Manhatten and close to Prospect Park. Enjoyed being in Brooklyn as it is a bit more 'realistic' than staying in Manhatten less tourists, and a well price nail shop near by. Close to food outlets for and last min essentials, aundry shops and a drycleaner. 

A/C wasn't installed when we arrived but this was sorted out very quickly with 2 units put in. 

Apartment is near a rail station so that meant being woken up at 8am every morning by the noise in the main and second bedroom but I guess you could buy earplugs or something.

Apartment was well decorated but not much entertainment in the house ie no tv or radio.

[QWERTY123]The apartment was comfortable and very clean. Luminous and spacious. Very close to the subway. Adreinne was helpful and well organized. There is not intercom or telephone, so if you will receive visits or your lost baggage, you must be waiting at the window...[QWERTY123]We were 4 people staying in the apartment and we found it clean and comfortable, although it was a little bit cold in the main bedroom.
The location is excellent; extremely close to the subway, and finding street parking nearby is very easy. Communication with Adreinne was excellent and she was very helpful/pleasant. I would definitely consider staying here again the next time we visit NYC.[QWERTY123]I enjoyed a comfortable and convenient long-term stay.  The street outside is a bit harsh, as other reviews have mentioned, but you can head out in any direction and find many of Brooklyn's gems close by.  Tatsu Sushi, Outpost, and my favorite, Alice's Arbor, just to name a few.  There is much more if you venture out a little farther.  It's really great to have the C train right there.  The flat is cozy and sufficiently supplied.  The bedroom is a bit noisy, but I could live with it.  Adrienne is a quick responder to questions and problems, which is all you can really ask for.   As an added bonus, I had a car while I was there and I could almost always park right in front.  Crazy I know.[QWERTY123]This was a very nice, stylish apartment that was very conveniently located near the subway. There were some nice cafes in the area  too - especially Outpost for coffee/sandwiches, Hill Cafe for brunch and Peaches Hothouse for southern-style dinner and cocktails. There is also a supermarket round the corner on Fulton. The apartment had everything we needed and the daybed in the little room of the bedroom was perfectly comfortable for one. The only problem we had with the apartment was the noise from the street as the windows in the bedroom + side room do not properly close and are covered with plastic that rattles a bit in the wind. The bus stop opposite and other traffic can be quite noisy and disruptive if you want a lie-in but we didn't find it affected our sleep. We appreciated Adreinne's independent approach (self pick-up of the keys, wifi password provided) and she was very understanding and flexible when we had some confusion at the end of our stay. Airbnb were also very helpful about this and overall we were very pleased. I would thoroughly recommend this apartment.[QWERTY123]Not 100% what I expected from the airbnb visuals, but serviceable. If you need a place to stay close to Franklin station - this is the place.[QWERTY123]Adreinne is a great host, quick responding by mail and service minded. We loved the apartment, clean and cosy. Bathroom and kitchen was super nice. The location was everything we wanted from our visit to New York. Less than 100 meters from the metro train that took us directly to/from the airport (JFK) and downtown Manhattan. Fulton street is a great place to stay, full of nice shops, delis and food spots. This was my first time staying in Brooklyn, but I'm definitely coming back.[QWERTY123]Nice stay in Adreinne's Brooklyn appartment. The AC has been appreciated as it was really hot outside! The proximity of the subway station is very good point.
The only drawback is the S train station that is noisy.
Thanks to our hostess![QWERTY123]Our experience in Adrienne's Brooklyn apartment was very good!
The place looks great for 4 people it have all of the equipment that you need! We didn't missed a thing!
Adrienne is a wonderful host! She made as feel at home!
The place was very clean!
The neighborhood is not so pleasant for girls at night to come back late. But the apartment is very safe and secure.  
The place is very close to subway station to reach everywhere you need in the city and it takes between 20-35 min. 
Theres a great supermarket near the apartment but its not open late night. 
Adrienne was available any time we needed her and helped us when we had needed.  
We had the best time in NYC a lot thanks to apartment and the host (Website hidden by Airbnb)[QWERTY123]The flat itself was big and nice and very clean so I enjoyed my stay there. 
I was there for business on my own and obviously had a longer way to go to get to mid-town but that was my choice. Its convenient that the station is right opposite because I would not necessarily recommend girls to run around that part of Brooklyn on their own so much. I did not feel unsafe though either. If you're a group of people and planning on spending lots of time in Brooklyn then I guess its perfect. I did not meet Adreinne but instructions were clear and it was easy to get in and out. 

The matrass wasn't great and the road quite noisy but again that's not a huge issue.[QWERTY123]Very near to the subway to Manhattan! Nice flat with everything you need. The wifi works without any problems. We can recommend this Place absolutly.[QWERTY123]Beautiful apartment, the neighborhood and the subway are a bit noisy, but you will forget the noise really fast.
The subway is really near, 15-20 minutes ride to Manhattan.
The autonomy is nice.
I would rent again if i ever go back to New York.[QWERTY123]We had an amazing time!
We did not see Adreinne in person, but her instructions to get to the appartment were very clear. 
The place is really comfortable, clean, and we felt at home. I loved the design and the atmosphere ! we had everything to cook, chill and have a nice time.
It 's located in a nice part of Brooklyn, we felt safe there. the subway station is right around the corner, so you can get to Manhattan very quickly. 
The only two things that can make you hesitate are the fact that the flat is on the second floor, with no elevator ( but nice wooden stairs), and no TV (for some people that's important). If you don't care about those details, this is a place that I highly recommend! 
[QWERTY123]Just on the verge of tipping over to a total hippster dominated domane, this brownstone hideout is still a part of gritty, lively brooklyn. Location and apartment were great, the autonomy was great, would definitely go again. Just remember (as in all of amerika) to bring your own toilet paper![QWERTY123]Adreinne's place was great. We spent few days in it and it was very clean with everything we needed for us and our two little boys. It's a second floor apartment but, honestly, it's very easy to access. Very close from all the commodities and only two steps from subway to Manhattan. The place is very safe (we come back one evening at 11 p.m without felling unsecured) and the neighborhood very nice. We can park easily (we had a car). The only thing : be careful about parking because we had our car towed because it was parked just beside a fire hydrant we did not respect the 15 feet. But some neighbors helped us to find it. We never went to Brooklyn and it was just perfect. The ""petit plus"" as we say in French : the pictures which are in the wall of Adreinne's apartment are really beautiful and help to make you feel good ![QWERTY123]Adreinne's apartment is lovely.  So bright and clean and felt like a real Brooklyn experience.  Perfectly situated a 2 minute walk from the C train and within walking distance of some great bars and restaurants.[QWERTY123]Appartement tres propre et bien situé (métro a 1 minute)
[QWERTY123]El apartamento era muy acogedor y tenía todo lo necesario para hacer tu estancia muy cómoda. Estaba limpio y bien cuidado. La estación de Metro estaba cruzando la calle y en 20-25 minutos podías estar en el corazón de Manhattan. A nosotros no nos molesto para nada el ruido del tren. La zona tiene un par de supermercados y varios comercios muy próximos. Tal vez la única mejora, sería el colchón. En general el piso es muy recomendable.[QWERTY123]Had a great stay in Brooklyn. The location was perfect and conveniently located across the street from the subway. There are plenty of shops and cafes close by and anything you need can be found close by. The apartment itself was very spacious and had everything we needed. The only downside was having to carry quite a large suitcase up so many stairs! The downstairs neighbour was also very friendly and helpful![QWERTY123]Adreinne provided all necessary information we needed. She explained it very well so that everything worked perfect. 
It's a cute and clean apartment. However it is relatively noisy, but with earplugs you can sleep quite well in the night.
The subway is across the street where the local train to Manhattan stops. It takes approximately 25 minutes to midtown Manhattan.[QWERTY123]We never met Adrienne, she explain us how to go in but when we had problem with big water leak we had in her appartment...
she wasn't so available...

In summer (without rain), this appartment is very nice with a lot of light and a nive view on the subway.
It's relativly calm and with nice furniture inside[QWERTY123]Adrienne's instructions on how to find the place were terrific, the location was exceptional - basically perfect. Right next to the C Train, which makes it so easy to get on and off of Manhattan. We stayed three weeks with three people (all separate beds), which was a bit of a stretch but manageable.[QWERTY123]""Charming"" stay in the 3rd floor flat of a typical brooklin house. Located in the renovating brooklin close to subway c/s lines giving direct access to new york from lower manhattan to northern harlem. We really appreciated resting in Adreinne's appartment. With its 70s design furnitures, nice clichés and motown soul, you will enjoy the owner culture and art. Only regret was not to meet her. If we don't have the same roots, I guess we share the same cultural interests and influences.[QWERTY123]Great proximity to the subway for exploring the city. Spacious apartment with good facilities.[QWERTY123]Well decorated and cosy appartment. Perfect place for 4 girls together. We loved to cook in the well equipped kitchen and to have breakfast at our own table. Close to major subway-lines, it's the ideal place for a first time NY. Adrienne also had a good view on nice places to eat, drink, relax in the neighbourhood. Highly recommended.[QWERTY123]Was a fun stay in Brooklyn and the place was great![QWERTY123]We never meet Adreinne but directions for how to get in were clear. The apartment was nicely decorated with everything we needed from kitchen supplies to towels. The bathroom was really nice with a bathtub and a good shower. The apartment could use some attention but was in general nice.

The apartment is conveniently located next to the subway. It's good that it's only 1 min walk to transportation, the downside was that you could hear the trains from the apartment. There was also a construction site next to the building which woke us up early in the morning. The noise wasn't a big concern for me.

I can recommend Adreinne's apartment![QWERTY123]We had a really great stay at Adreinne's apartment!! Large apartment for being NY and fresh bathroom with all the amenities described in the profile. She was also very quick to answer whenever we had questions. The queen size bed was great, but the other beds where only ok. Overall a great experience.[QWERTY123]Wohnung wie auf Bildern angegeben, gute Bahnverbindung, Manhattan 5th19th in 45 Min erreichbar, aktuell große Baustelle direkt neben der Wohnung, Probleme mit der Heizung[QWERTY123]Very clean and nicely decorated, just in front of a C subway station. Thera are lots of stores and different restaurants in the neighborhood.[QWERTY123]My partner and I had a great stay at Adreinne's place! The location is great, close to restaurants, bars, trains. The space is decorated beautifully with great art and photographs.[QWERTY123]We had an amazing time during our stay!  Apartment is really nice and Adreinne made us feel at home.  Check in is very convenient.  Train station is right in front of the apartment so it is extremely convenient but it can get noisy at night so it might be difficult for a light sleeper.  Otherwise, it is a perfect stay ![QWERTY123]My friends and I had a pleasant stay in Adreinne’s apartment. I really loved and enjoyed all the art on the walls. The apartment has everything you need. You are super connected if you stay at Adreinne’s apartment. The subway station is just 2 min away and you are super fast in Downtown Brooklyn and Manhattan with the C and A train. Thank you for this lovely stay![QWERTY123]Amazing host and great stay. Love her art and style.[QWERTY123]Great apartment, great location, and Adreinne was quick to answer any queries. Highly recommend.[QWERTY123]Casa spaziosa, peccato solo per la cameretta da cui si accede passando per la camera matrimoniale..posizione della casa abbastanza buona, vicinissima alla metro e a supermarket..un po’ meno per pub e locali serali..con 35/40 minuti si è a Manhattan![QWERTY123]The host canceled this reservation 12 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.[QWERTY123]Adreinne's place is mostly as pictured, it's got charm, it's close the the C train, and the neighborhood has lots of great restaurants nearby. There were just a couple of issues to take into account or check with the host on before booking. The unit is up two sets of somewhat steep, slightly scary stairs, some of the steps have come loose from the wall and the railing is very low and also loose. The place is pretty noisy, you can hear the neighbors and there is currently construction happening right next door. Some odd things; we had two guests but there was only one towel, there are potentially three beds (bed, fold-out couch and futon in a room connected to the bedroom) but no extra sheets, and we couldn't find any silverware.

Overall I would say this place is a decent value and worth considering, but again just make sure you check with the host on some of the things above.[QWERTY123]Apartment was clean and comfortable. Spacious for 2 guests. Adreinne was easy to communicate with."	40.68111224139488	-73.95591103683243	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/12940	2	110.0	0.82
101	13050	"We loved Jennifer's apartment. Really nicely decorated duplex,comfortable,clean and spacious.A couple of blocks from the subway. Safe and quiet neighborood.
Jennifer was very accomodating and helpful.
A perfect stay for us.[QWERTY123]We enjoyed staying at J's home.  We had everything we needed to make for a comfortable stay.  We felt welcomed.  The subway is only 3 blocks away and there are places to get coffee and groceries in the neighborhood.  The only drawback is that in the interior there is a circular narrow metal stairway between the two floors which was manageable but a little difficult for us 60 year olds.[QWERTY123]Jennifer's place was so beautiful. It is just like how the photos show. She has an eye for great decor. Her place feels so home-y and welcoming. Jennifer was a great host. It was easy to contact her if I needed anything. She was also very accommodating since we got to the city so late. The neighborhood is very pretty and has great restaurants, stores, and great access to the subway. I would definitely stay here again in the future.[QWERTY123]Nous avons adorés notre séjour dans l'appartement de Jennifer. 

La communication fût très facile et elle fît tout en son pouvoir pour rendre notre séjour agréable. L'arrivé et le départ furent aussi très simple.

L'appartement est très joli et plutôt spacieux. C'est idéal pour une famille avec un ou deux enfants. Il y a deux chambre avec un lit double chacun, mais l'une d'entre elles est une chambre d'enfant avec un lit en hauteur. Nous étions 5 et j'ai dormi sur le divan qui était très confortable... tout dépend du niveau de confort que vous recherchez. Il y a plusieurs livres pour enfants et ma fille de 9 ans était très heureuse de constater que plusieurs d'entre eux étaient en français. Le seul petit hic auquel je pense, c'est qu'il faisait plutôt chaud dans l'appartement en général et qu'il n'y avait qu'un seul ventilateur situé dans la chambre principale. Mais il faut dire qu'il faisait entre 35'C et 40'C cette fin de semaine-là à NYC !!

Le quartier est très agréable mais peut être assez bruyant le soir. Pour notre part ça ne nous a pas trop dérangé... mais nous vivons dans un quartier similaire à Montréal et nous sommes habitués aux bruits urbains. Si vous êtes sensible aux décibels nocturnes ça pourrait vous causer des ennuis. Sinon c'est un quartier populaire très agréable de Brooklyn qui a une belle mixité sociale.

Nous y retournerions volontiers !![QWERTY123]This Airbnb experience was one of the best I have had. The apartment is comfy, welcoming and easy to get to. The bunk bed is perfect for kiddos. Jenn was easy to talk with and very helpful. This gets my highest recommendation.[QWERTY123]Nasz pobyt na Brooklynie w apartmencie Jennifer byl fantastyczny. Mieszkanie jest ogromne i bardzo przestrzenne, bylo tez fantastycznie przygotowane i posprzatane na nasz przyjazd. Spacer do metra zajmuje ok 10 minut, ale okolica jest przyjemna i pozwala poznac klimat i zwyczaje kolejnych mieszkancow.[QWERTY123]Wunderbares und gemütliches Appartement mit freundlichen Nachbarn.Wir fühlten uns sofort zu Hause und die Gastgeberin war sehr zuvorkommend. Wir kommen gerne wieder!  Auch für Familien bestens geeignet.[QWERTY123]Jennifer was a wonderful host!  House rules and necessary info (wifi password, recycling, etc.) was clearly laid out on a sheet of paper. Building is in range of a Pokestop!

There were a couple of quirks with this BnB that should be noted.  We happened to travel on one of the hottest weeks of the year and had to beef up the air circulation in the child's room where the loft bed is located.  With the bed sitting right under the ceiling, the hot air rose and the AC from the window below the bed could not reach the bed without some help.  Jennifer had an additional box fan that we were able to plug in and it made the room so much more comfortable.

As for the other quirk, we were informed that the air conditioners draw a lot of power and there is a tendency for the breaker to be tripped if you're not creative with where you plug in your hair dryer.  This only applied to the upper floor, so the hair dryer was used in the bedroom downstairs.  Depending on how many outlets you need for your devices, you may end up charging your phone, curling  your hair, or applying makeup in an alternate room away from your sleeping area (ie: kitchen).  Plenty of seating though, from regular furniture to bar stools.  Mirrors are not lacking, either.

Given the heat, we weren't interested in walking any sort of distance, so you'll be happy to know that the B43 and B52 (you can chuckle) buses are just a block or two away and can easily get you to a variety of subway lines. Near the A and C train stop is a great grocery store that prepares a variety of hot food for you, even late-night (visited after midnight).  We never once felt uncomfortable with our surroundings.

The two queen beds were very comfortable! I'm jealous that a 10 year old has such a cool room with fun books to read. We were away from the house the majority of our stay, but what we did see of the decor was nice!  Washer/Dryer is available to you, as well as a fridge, iron, and coffee maker.  The towels were great and PooPourri was available to us in the bathroom.

Jennifer was available by phone/text for any of our questions.  A lockbox is used for you to put the keys at check-in/check-out. The way the building is laid out, Jennifer was able to drop off anything that may have been needed (ie: additional coffee and toilet paper) without having to enter the apartment.  Just make sure to specify your check-in/check-out times days in advance so you can ensure the place is ready when you need it. Thanks Jennifer![QWERTY123]L'Appartement de Jennyfer et de sa fille est vraiment très agréable et chaleureux. Il y a beaucoup de livres en français et de jeux pour les enfants. On s'y sent très bien.  Il y a ce qu'il faut pour faire la cuisine, même s'il n'y a pas à proprement parler de salle à manger, il y a une petite table basse ronde dans le salon ou l'on peut s'installer. Il y a la climatisation si besoin et c'est agréable pour la nuit s'il fait chaud. Il faut marcher un peu jusqu'au métro (7 blocks donc 15 mn avec des enfants ).  En bref, nous avons passé une très agréable semaine chez Jennyfer.[QWERTY123]Jennifer's place was perfect. The appartement is really big and their is a lot of space for every guests. It's well located and close to a subway station. Their is a lot of cool spots to grab a coffee around and enjoy the neighborhood. 

The communication with the host was really simple and getting the keys also. Jennifer's make our stay really great and her appartement is so beautiful! It's in a true Brooklyn building with a lot of history![QWERTY123]Jennifer was a fantastic host. He instructions were clear and easy to follow. Her home looked exactly like the pictures shown and she keeps it very organized.

Thanks for letting me stay there![QWERTY123]Me and my boyfriend recently stayed with Jullett in her master bedroom with private bathroom. We recommend her to anyone looking to stay in new york. She is close to the airport with easy access to public transportation to the city. The room was very clean and comfortable providing clean towels and great hospitality.
Thanks Jullett we will definitely be staying there next time we come![QWERTY123]Me and my friends are so glad that we find Jullett:) House and rooms are realy nice and clean. Jullett treats us like we are a part of her familly... She is very helpfull and friendly:) She makes us feel so comfortable in her place. If we gonna visit NYC again, we will stay at Jullett place:)[QWERTY123]Jullett was a great host! I was on the go for most of my stay, but she was very accommodating, and even came to the bus stop to make sure we knew about the variations in the subway schedule that weekend. The bedroom and bathroom were perfect. Very clean, and well stocked with towels, soap, etc. I highly recommend staying with her if you need to be in Queens, and you will be REALLY close to JFK![QWERTY123]This was my and my friend's first bnb experience and it was really good. Jullett's home was clean,spacious and lovely. We were even provided with a mini fridge and a microwave in the room which were very helpful. Though it is a bit far away from the main city, the transportation is real good and it was not at all a problem.

Thank you Jullett for making our first ever visit to New York City so comfortable and memorable.[QWERTY123]The perfect place to stay. I was visiting for a week for work and it was so wonderful to come back to a place that felt like home. No matter how crazy my work schedule, Jullett was completely cool. There when you need her, not when you don't. 

Jullett is the perfect host. There was a snow storm when I was there and before I had to go to work the walkways were shoveled. I haven't gotten that at major hotel chains! 

I will definitely be staying here whenever work brings me back and perhaps for a vacation since it is the most affordable place anywhere near NYC. I can't think of enough great things to say! Absolutely wonderful![QWERTY123]Super host that worked with us when our plane was delayed. We did not arrive until past midnight. She was easy to communicate with by phone and email. 
The location was good for a quick night crash when we flew. It is a good distance from the city which is why we only booked one night. It is clean and appears like the pictures.[QWERTY123]Jullet was an AWESOME host! She was super friendly and very helpful. The room was spotless, top notch, had it's own full sized private bathroom, and air conditioning.

Great price. Great location. couldn't have asked for a better deal. Highly recommended.[QWERTY123]Jullett was a wonderful host. 
Her little Hostel is clean and super comfortable.Its quite a ride to Manhattan but it's worth it.
The room is big and the beds are just perfect. A grocery store and a bus stop are right around the corner
All in all I had a very nice time at Julletts home with a very human price.[QWERTY123]my stay at jullett place was outstanding the place is  very clean and well kept and well organized.. if anyone is looking for a place too stay in newyork .. this is the place too stay you won't be disapointed,.the location is great. on my next visit i well defindly stay there again..

The only thing was that it was a bit of a trek to get into the heart of Manhattan, but definitely worth it for the low price that it was.[QWERTY123]At first me and my partner were wary of Airbnb because of the newness of the concept but after trying it out for the first time at Jullett's place I would personally recommend it to all my friends. Jullett was very friendly to me and my family and made us feel like we were at a second home. The place was clean and met all our needs. Thumbs up to the place and 2 thumbs up for Jullett our hostess! The bustop is a 2 min walk which goes directly to the subway where you just ride to Manhattan directly , there were also enough deli's in the neighborhood to buy whatever groceries one might need. If you ever want to travel to NY take my word and stay with Jullett right on budget :)[QWERTY123]Jullett was a great woman! She is really  friendly! She drove my friend to airport, when he almost late to the plane. And woke me up at 4 a.m. when I had to go to my plane and gave me pizza. Thank's a lot![QWERTY123]If you are looking for home away from home, this is the right spot. Jullett is a wonderful woman and will help you with anything you need. Location is great. Close to the train LIRR which is only 30 minutes to Manhattan or to the Long Beach. I  would stay there any time again.[QWERTY123]My friend and I stayed at Jullett's b&b for 9 nights.  Jullett was very friendly and helpful.  Jullett loaned us her maps and gave us recommandations on places to visit and how to get around.  The house was very clean and tidy and there was a nice variety of food in the fridge for the guests.

Only downside was that it was a little far from Manhattan.  There was a bus stop right outside the b&b but it was a ~20 min bus ride to the subway station, followed by about a ~30 min ride on the subway before we reach Time Square.

Overall, we had a nice time staying at Jullett's lovely b&b and would highly recommend it to everyone else.  Thanks Jullett![QWERTY123]Stayed 4 nights. Very nice and clean home. Bonus was the use of the kitchen.  The room was very comfortable. There was a yappy dog barking first night.  Walls were thin and heard upstair's guest. Was told we couldn't use AC after midnight even though it's advertised as a having AC.  We had one room with 2 beds with private bath - good size with nice decor.[QWERTY123]This my first time experience with staying in a 'non-hotel' environment opened my thinking that I can get a lot more and spend less with staying at the Right on Budget! Jullett is very accomodative with the check-in time, very nice person, facility is extra clean, quiet location but safe. My family will comeback again when we go to NY next time! Sincere thanks to Jullett, two thumbs UP![QWERTY123]We came to visit our family and friends in NY.  We stayed for 3 weeks and had a great time.
Jullett's place was nice and clean. She was very nice and accommodating to our needs.
Very convenient access to public transportation including: buses, subway, and train. JFK airport is just a 10 minute bus ride.[QWERTY123]It was our family’s first trip using this website and Jullett's place. Jullett was very accommodating with our arrival time and gave us good instructions on how to get around using the New York’s bus and subway. The place was clean, quit, and safe.  Next trip we make to NYC we plan to use her place.[QWERTY123]Jullett was really responsive to our emails and was great on our arrival. Her place was really convenient to the bus. rail and light rail service in and out of Manhatten and her kindness in explaining the low-down on how and what to do was  very helpful. We found our beds comfortable and the ensuite we had was luxury. Kitchen all the go and breakfast too.  We had privacy but also opportuities to meet a couple of other room occupiers.  The area is pretty safe and the locals were really helpful with directions and even bailing us out on some  train fares we misjudged. Close shopping for basic foods etc. 
Got a $40 flat fare there from La Guardia and then a quick $25 cab to JFK at the end of our stay. 
Our room had a queen and a double bed in it so we took the opportunity to really stretch out. There was a bit of noise from upstairs but it calmed down at 12.The neighbourhood was pretty quiet really. We would go back there no worries should we wish to visit again the city that never sleeps. The American Indian Museum down by the Staten Island Ferry  was awesome but it closes at 5 so get in a good two hours early- you will be rewarded. Thanks Jullett.[QWERTY123]It was a really nice time ! Thank you very much.[QWERTY123]Clean, comfortable, friendly, & cozy. Great for the most part. Main cons - air conditioning could have been cooler and we weren't able to buy metro cards at the train station that was close by. So transportation was an issue. No taxi would pick us up in the area. We ended up driving everywhere.[QWERTY123]Jullett was very hospitable. When we arrived way later due to the 4 hours of gridlock traffic we were stuck in, she was there to let us in. Her place is very close to the bus and trains. The bedroom we stayed in was perfect with two very comfortable beds, a small refridgerator, and our own private bathroom! My friend and I had a very nice stay! Thanks Jullett![QWERTY123]The room is nicer in person, very quiet & clean We enjoyed our stay!! Service was great. Thank you for letting us stay at your place Jullett.[QWERTY123]I stayed with Jullett and my two daughters for a week. She was a wonderful host and could not do enough to help us out. The bus stop to the subway was right outside the house so getting around was easy. The trip to Manhatten was full of fun and surprises and gave us an opportunity to see people and do things we would not normally have done.

The house was and still will be spotless, Jullett is meticulous and has though of everything including food in the fridge and plenty of toiletries.

There was a conveinence store just round the corner which had everything - it was also a deli and was open all night. next to that was a dry cleaners and across the road a launderette who would do your washing for you if you did not have time $10 for 10 pounds. 

I was a little confused by one of the postings who said they could not get tickets for bus and trains, there is a western union 1 minutes walk from Julletts and you can get an unlimited pass for 29.99 for 7 days and that will take you all over the place using subway and buses.

We would definitely come back here Jamaica in Queens is a really cool place wish we could have stayed longer.

Thanks Jullett for a great time and an easy place to stay
[QWERTY123]I found the room as expected with private bath.
The room was neat as well and bus stops were close.
As it was extremely Hot and I was travelling with my Twin couple of 15 months old (infants), I had to exceed by one hour the limit of time use for the A/C the first night (which I think if there was a fan in the ceiling, i would power OFF the A/C by midnight as expected).
Jullet left some water in the fridge on our disposal prior our arrival (which i appreciated).

I would advice future guess to wake up hours before departure in order to rearrange the room the way it was found before leaving for the airport (as it seems that the room is expected to be left the way it was found, which in my case, with two 15 months old children in my hand,  could not happen at 100% under the pressure of picking a flight at 9 AM JFK).

Thanks again Jullet![QWERTY123]Very nice comfortable place.  Clean and accomodating.  Jullett was very friendly and helpful.  Access to public transportation was close by and easy to navigate.  I would stay again![QWERTY123]We stayed in this room for 4 nights and had a great time! The room is clean, Jullett is very friendly and helpful. Just the way to Manhattan is a little bit too long, but okay.

Thanks so much![QWERTY123]Clean and cozy but the sound coming from upstairs could disturb one's sleep at times.[QWERTY123]Dear Jullett,
Hello,
Here by this note I want to thank to you for all things.
I had a nice time in New York and enjoyed from this trip.

Your guidance was perfect, with you explanation I visited many beautiful places and used my time very well.
I would like to come there and stay in your home again, hopfully next time, probably soon, I do not know.
Thanks for your hospitality,
Thanks for all things.

Regards,
Ali,
[QWERTY123]We have spent a great 6 nights at Jullett's place. It is quite close to JFK (paid 14 $ for taxi) in a good, quiet neighborhood. We travelled to Manhattan every day back and forth so be prepaired to pay the LIRR fee which is around 10 $(return ticket) in off-peak season. It will bring you to the Penn Station in 25 mins and generally running in every hour 24/7. Our room was clean with comfortable beds with our own bathroom. There were a few additional rooms with other guests on our floor with a common full-equipped kitchen. Jullett was very helpfull and flexible (we arrived in the late night due to the bed weather on the airport). I would certainly recommend the place to everyone.[QWERTY123]it was our last minute request, because another recervation was cancelled one day before our arrival to NYC. The room is clean and has private bathroom. The only minus is that the house is situated a bit too far from Manhatten and it takes around 1-1.20 hour to get to the city. You can also take the express train but it costs around 6$ one way. 
But in general our time in NYC was great and Jullet was very nice and helpfull host, she even kept our luggage when we went to Miami for 5 days! Thank you so much for your help, Jullet![QWERTY123]The place is VERY clean, that was like the most important thing for us, and that you have a private bathroom, the area where is placed seems to be very safe. Jullett is a great host, she helped us to find out how to get to the most importantes places of NY, the only little problem is that takes like an hour to get to Manhattan but the house is located where you can fin transportation pretty easy, so it was fine for us. Thank you Jullett, i will be back in your house, for sure.[QWERTY123]Short visit in NY ,really liked the room ,very clean and big enough ,the bathroom also was good size .
The common kitchen well equipped .
Perfect location if you need a  quick access to NYC in around 30 min by LIRR and in the same time very close to JFK airport at a very reasonable price .
I will definitely visit again this place during my next travel 
[QWERTY123]Jullett Dilllon's house was exactly what i needed to relax and get away from everything. The house was clean, quiet and her brother was around just in case something was needed. I didn't get a chance to meet Jullett because of her job schedule, but I was very please with the accommodation. The bus stop was across the street from her house. Her brotther gave me directions where to find the 99cent store, Chinese restaurant, Corner store and pizza shop.

I will recommend your Jullett house to my friends and family.

Thanks Jullett for open your house to me and my friend Lorraine.[QWERTY123]Very clean and nice environment to stay, Jullett was the perfect host as well.[QWERTY123]Great room with a good amount of space with a private bathroom. Very clean  apartment overall and I would recommend this place to anyone that wants to visit the city at a cheap rate. The apartment is right next to the LIRR Locust Manor station and gets to the city in like a half an hour. Close to a lot of convenience stores and places to eat. Friendly neighborhood overall and if you need help with any questions don's hesitate to ask Jullett or her brother Garnett.[QWERTY123]We spend 2 nights at Jullett place. The apparment was very clean. We needed because we wanted to stay near the airport. Everything was ok. She gave us information about the appartment and her brother help us a lot with many other things, like the bus to the airport and find a place to eat. He was very patient and nice with us. We took the bus at 3.04 am to go to the airport, and was right on time.[QWERTY123]The room itself was wonderful. We had our own bathroom and closet. There is an air conditioning unit also which was nice in mid summer. The location was a bit deceiving. If you want to head into the city, you should expect over an hour of commuting. We found it easier to drive on some days. Jullett's brother was much more helpful. He gave us a map of the subway system, directions on how to get there, and advice on where to go. There are also very strict house rules. Showers can't be longer than 5 minutes long, air conditioning can't e run for over a certain amount of time, etc. Overall, we thought the room was very affordable and worth the price.[QWERTY123]We had a great time in this accomodation. Everything very clean, new towels after 2 days and good connection to public transportation system.[QWERTY123]Jullett was very nice and gracious and her rules were outlined clearly. The neighborhood is quite a distance away from downtown New York, but the public transportation is easy to figure out. Average commute to the city was 1 hour 15 minutes. (Bus to Subway to City)[QWERTY123]It was a wonderful stay. Private. Good transportation availability.
Meals availability in the neighbourhood good. Seems safe neighbourhood no incidents when I was there. Very clean.
Mall availability within 15 or so minutes by bus.
highly recommend. As good as I have experienced internationally including South Africa and France. John 
South Africa and France.[QWERTY123]Great host!....extremely nice and friendly atmosphere. Super clean and hospitable....Julett is Awesome![QWERTY123]Our host was wonderful and kind. But location was very far from everywhere.[QWERTY123]My experience with Julett was my very first AirBnB experience as well, so I did not really know what to expect going into it.  I arrived in NYC earlier than expected and Julett did respond to my text message and allow me to come to her home earlier than the scheduled check in.  The directions she gave were accurate and the LIRR does stop literally 2 blocks from her house. She gave me a map and showed me where to go in NYC, and walked me outside and showed me where all the bus stops were.  The only CONS, I have for this stay were 
1. My reservation was modified to stay in a different room in her room than what I booked. She said that she had some regulars come in for the weekend and she gave them my reserved room.  The room I was moved to was fine, however, the main reason I requested my particular room was because of the private bathroom.  So my friend and I had to use the bathroom down the hall, but Julett assured me there would be no one else using that bathroom at all but me.  On at least 3 occasions, I went into that bathroom and the toilet was unflushed from someone using it, I knew it was not me or my friend, so someone in the house was obviously using the bathroom as well, and also not cleaning up behind themselves.  Also, one morning that I was taking a shower, someone kept knocking on the door and twisting at the handle, when I finally exited the bathroom I saw that there was a 7 or 8 year old girl standing there like she was waiting to use the bathroom, again I was told that this would not be a shared bathroom.  When I was walking back to the kitchen, I also noticed an older man brushing his teeth in the kitchen sink.
2. I'm assuming the other people that were staying there were a family of about 5 or so people, so it was uncomfortable for me to walk to and from the bathroom because they would be sitting at the kitchen table just kind of staring.  My friend and I even came home one night at about 1 am, and they were still sitting at the kitchen table. So again it made me uncomfortable going back and forth to the shower.
3. The home is extremely muggy, I'm assuming because the air does not run much. I had a wall unit in my room, but it still did not really cool the area down, so it was hard sleeping being so hot.

All together this is a pretty nice home and my experience was not that bad. However,it is just extremely far from the city so be careful with coming back so late the trains only run like every hour. I found out the hard way![QWERTY123]Jullett's a nice host. Comfortable. Easy access to Manhattan. If I have a chance to go to NY again, I would stay her house and talk with her more.[QWERTY123]My experience during our short stay with Ms Juliet was superb. The place was very clean and well kept. I whole heartedly recommend her[QWERTY123]Yes, yes.[QWERTY123]c'était la première fois que j'utilisais airbnb et je  me suis permise de lui téléphoner de France pour voir comment je récupérais les clés puisqu'elle ne savait même pas à quelle heure j'arrivais et comment aller chez elle. Elle m'a demandé si j'avais un numéro de réservation et dans ce cas lire ses recommandations. Je lui ai exprimé mes difficultés en anglais…toujours pas du tout aimable. Pas du tout rassurée. Elle m'a ensuite bien expliqué pour aller à NY City, parfait pour cette partie là. La chambre est correcte, le lit bon, par contre un(e) voisin(e) au dessus fait du bruit( marche comme sur un plancher) jusqu'à 1h du mat et recommence à 5h …quand dort il (elle)? très bruyant aussi avec les avions…10 minutes de l'aéroport et mauvaise isolation phonique.[QWERTY123]Jullett is a very friendly and helpful host. She arrived when we reached the place and explained everything to us, along with helping us with a map of NY and directions on how to get around and what to see. Overall, very satisfied. :)
Also, the place is 5mins from JFK airport by cab. But almost 1.5hrs to Manhattan if you take the bus and subway or 30mins if you take the Long Island Railroad.[QWERTY123]Nice comfortable place but far from manhattan[QWERTY123]Everything was as expected nothing more nothing less. Very clean and spacious.
One suggestion is to provide the contact of the care taker for easier communication.[QWERTY123]The room is tidy and clean, so is the common area. The neighborhood is also nice and people are very friendly. Only downside is you can hear the noise from upstairs pretty well, so it gets annoying during night time cuz people upstairs were moving around stuff even after 12am.[QWERTY123]Upon arriving at Jullett's Airbnb I introduced myself and extended my hand but she stated ""that won't be necessary"", so the initial experience was not welcoming. The handle to the front gate came off in my hand in front of Jullett but that was replaced later. The place was as described. Room and bathroom were clean, but one of the towels although I felt it was clean it had some yellowish stains. I called and texted Jullett but got no response at first, then seeing  a family member on the property and asked them to help me out which occurred a day later exchanging the towel and providing me with a requested bath towel. She was very nice. The only nightstand lamp was broken (there was an overhead light) and I informed Jullett about that with no response. I did feel safe in the neighborhood. The parking was A+. Although the two dogs behind the gate made alot of noise they were nice but walking over the poop when departing wasn't. And as a previous reviewer stated there is alot of noise heard over those hardwood floors when trying to sleep. Lastly, I only communicated with the host on check-in; luckily nothing urgent came up. Overall, it's a tossup, you can't beat the price, the place is clean, safe, great parking and some compromising as mentioned above. Thanks.[QWERTY123]The host canceled this reservation 22 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.[QWERTY123]My plans fell thru last minute and Jullett was very gracious to allow me to book right away. thanks[QWERTY123]The room was clean. The place is in a good neighborhood, many ways to go to Manhattan. We enjoyed our staying! Thank you Jullett![QWERTY123]Juliet made me feel welcome by allowing me to get to know the home and be familiar with the surrounding and be comfortable like it was my own home. The place was clean and tidy and parking on the street wasn't a long wait for parking. The neighbourhood was great and I felt very safe.[QWERTY123]A good and well described room ! 
The communication with Jullett was easy, we had no problem during our trip to New York ![QWERTY123]Firstly let me say that I went to this apartment with an open mind as it was my first time using the service however I was given an instant shocker when the host didn't turn up until over an hour after my scheduled arrival time and with no one to assist me with checking in I had to sit outside and wait, I tried calling her posted number without success only to see her arrive and as abruptly and unapologetic as ever she walked in with a blande hi. No explanation or apology for being so tardy was given and despite her being rude throughout my entire checking in process I went along with it as she outlined to me when I asked about canceling she swiftly mentioned to me the she won't allow my payment to be released to me. Throughout my entire stay I had no one to get information from as she never answers her phone I had to just do without basic stuff that should have been provided, it was mostly noisy at nights waking me up several times per night. The only positive thing I can say about the apartment is it isn't dirty but the hosts attitude is and on my final day during packing I was made aware that my car which was parked out front was broken into and when the police came to take a report even before I got a chance to thoroughly check my vehicle she told them that they can leave because I don't seem like I cared. All in all I must say it was four days in a nightmare for me and I only went along with it because at the point when I arrived I had no choice but I definitely wouldn't recommend the place as a place to be , the host is rude, the area isn't safe , the place is noisy and generally it wasn't what was described on the site, highly disappointed.[QWERTY123]The location is convenient near the JFK airport. Also is very easy to go to Manhattan using the public transportation[QWERTY123]Place was beyond clean & I will book again if necessary[QWERTY123]The Jullett's place is very good.[QWERTY123]A really great place we got to stay in after our hotel room got canceled on us.
The room is exactly as pictured, the space very clean and spacious. The bathroom was great.
I highly recommend the deli down the street. Overall, a great and relaxed area.

Only “complaint” if any is that the walls are kinda thin. I could hear the people upstairs moving about at various hours of the day and it was LOUD.

Another thing to know, AT&T users, is that the service in that area is poor. I could barely send text messages out.[QWERTY123]Fair"	40.671169921714835	-73.76576428203829	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/13121	4	68.0	0.8

The room has sufficient space and the bed is AMAZING. 
Of course, the best is the location. 
Thanks Juan Pablo![QWERTY123]I had an amazing time in the apartment. Juan has been very nice and helpful and the flat is clean, tidy and very stylish. Highly recommended :-)[QWERTY123]Perfect stay in a clean, quiet and super cosy apartment in the hearth of Williamsburg, ultra convenient for both reaching things — Wythe Hotel, Rough Trade, Hotel Delmano, Smorgasburg, Brooklyn Night Bazaar, Bedford Ave L Subway Station... — and escaping things when needed. Though travelling, Juan Pablo proved a very available and proactive host. Felt just like home.[QWERTY123]Had to stay in 5 different places before moving into my own apartment, i had to say that i had the best time here!! i absolutely love the vibe, its very convenient and best place to stay to explore Williamsburg area.
